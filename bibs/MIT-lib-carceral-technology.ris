N2  - Control and Protect explores the meaning and significance of efforts designed to combat sex trafficking in the United States. A striking case study of the new ways in which law enforcement agents, social service providers, and nongovernmental advocates have joined forces in this campaign, this book reveals how these collaborations consolidate state power and carceral control. This book examines how partnerships forged in the name of fighting domestic sex trafficking have blurred the boundaries between punishment and protection, victim and offender, and state and nonstate authority.

N2  - This edited collection encourages philosophical exploration of the nature, aims, contradictions, promises and problems of the practice of education within prisons around the world. Such exploration is particularly necessary given the complex operational barriers to education, and higher education in particular, within prison-based teaching and learning. These operational barriers are matched by cultural and polemical barriers, such as the criticism of diverting resources to and spending money on prisoner education when the cost of some education seems prohibitive for people outside prison. More so than in other education contexts, prison education may fall short of higher ideals because it is shot through with both practical and moral-political problems and challenges, especially in the age of global late capitalism, high technology and mass incarceration or securitization. This book includes insights and issues around a wide range of areas including: ethics, religion, sociology,justice, identity and political and moral philosophy. Marcus K Harmes is Professor at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. He has published extensively in the fields of religious and political history, with a particular emphasis on British religious history and popular culture. He is the author of numerous studies on the church in modern popular culture, especially on film and television, including book chapters in the collections Doctor Who and Race and Time and Relative Dimensions in Faith. Barbara Harmes lectures at the University of Southern Queensland, Australia. Her doctoral research focussed on the discursive controls built around sexuality in late-nineteenth-century England. Her research interests include cultural studies and religion. She has published in areas including modern Australian politics, 1960s American television and her original field of Victorian literature. Meredith Harmes teaches communication and also works in the enabling programs at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia. Her research interests include modern British and Australian politics and popular culture in Britain and America.

N2  - People of color and other socio-economically marginalized groups in the United States experience a disproportionate burden of environmental challenges such as air pollution and extreme heat; the Environmental Justice (EJ) movement aims to combat these burdens and promote collective well being. Earth Observation (EO) technology, such as satellites, can be used to monitor air quality, extreme heat, and other quantities relevant to EJ. However the application of this technology in measuring EJ, or supporting EJ advocacy efforts has not been widely explored. Satellite EO systems also historically have not been designed with EJ end users in mind. This application is increasingly more pressing as space agencies like NASA are seeking information on how their data can be used to support underserved communities. This dissertation brings together EO data science, systems engineering, and community-engagement to elucidate opportunities and limitations of Earth Observation Technology for Environmental Justice Advocacy. The dissertation is organized into three categories of contributions -- Description, Evaluation, and Design/Prescription -- that are each composed of multiple research efforts. n Description, I apply a three-pronged approach to provide insights on the opportunities and limitations of EO data for EJ. First, along with a team of researchers, I assess peer- reviewed literature on satellite data for environmental justice through a scoping review. The second contribution of this chapter is an interview study with a subset of grassroots EJ actors about how they can use EO data in their domain of EJ activism which contests the exposure of prisons and incarcerated people to environmental hazards. The third contribution of this chapter is a system's engineering architectural description of NASA's current satellite EO for EJ ecosystem. Using justice theory as an analytical framework, I reveal limitations of NASA's current EO for EJ architecture for advancing holistic notions of EJ. In Evaluation, with support from co-authors, I measure spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution burden, and air and land surface temperature extremes in prison landscapes across the U.S. These studies contribute to a nascent literature documenting empirical evidence of environmental hazards in carceral landscapes. It also extends the literature on applications of satellite-derived and modeled geospatial data for EJ. In Design/Prescription, first, supported by 3 years of community engagement with prison EJ activists, I present the Design of a GIS decision support system that features EO data responding to expressed needs of prison EJ activists. Then, I present two essays that Prescribe recommendations for methodological innovations in the design and application of EO technologies and geospatial data for EJ advocacy. Together, these three chapters demonstrate the immediate relevance of EO and geospatial technologies for prison EJ advocacy, and broader implications for the EO community interested in supporting the aims of the EJ movement more holistically.

N2  - This story begins at the site of The Tombs, a jail in Chinatown that is currently being doubled in size as a part of a distributed alternative to the Rikers Island Jail. The new megajail will have capacity to house up to 886 people in detention and will include space for on-site services and programming, staff facilities, and publicly accessible commercial and community space on the ground floor. This exposes how architecture behaves as a mode of cultural production and acts in service of capitalist and carceral systems. Nowhere else is this more evident than in New York City's Chinatown - often called the final frontier for development in Lower Manhattan. Immigrants, who've long come in search of land, green pastures, and single-family homes, find themselves Downtown and within ethnic enclaves, where homeownership is historically and canonically low. At this site, generations of indigenous tribes, freed African communities, and various immigrant communities endure a cycle of settlement, disenfranchisement, and eventually, destruction. The city, rather than invest in its communities, responds each time with a new jail. Under this urban mode, architecture provides few forms of accessible inhabitation beyond the neo-feudal rental system and racialized prison industrial complex. It exists to extend exploitation by selling the dream of homeownership, yet only makes room to support a select few. This thesis is interested in the limited means of shelter that are encapsulated within the architectural imagination -- it asks to reconsider new value systems beyond ownership and incarceration. If architecture were to reimagine how it produces -- culturally, tectonically, morally - how could it act in service of the people of Chinatown, and in earnest support of the Dream that the profession has helped to proliferate? Or better yet, this thesis will reject and reverse the pattern of the site to wholly reimagine Chinatown and its dreams: first, to destroy the jail, then, to facilitate reconstruction, re-enfranchisement, and resettlement of communities lost.

N2  - My dissertation explores how "anti-trafficking" has emerged as a global network of humanitarian professionals, law enforcement, and software companies collaborating to address the issue of child exploitation and trafficking online. I argue that the anti-trafficking network consolidates expertise through a shared moralizing politics of bureaucracy and carceral sensibility of securitization. This network mobilizes the issue of child protection to expand the reach of technologies of search and prediction, and to afford legitimation to a newly normalized level of digital surveillance. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with the United Nations and anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, with a child protection NGO and police in the Netherlands, and with software companies and law enforcement in the United States. I use two case studies to support my argument that the child protection movement has motivated the expansion of digital policing and surveillance: 1) image detection software developed in collaboration between social media and software companies and international law enforcement organizations; and 2) the design and deployment of a 3D moving avatar of a photorealistic girl used in a child sex exploitation sting operation by an NGO working with an advertising firm. I draw from queer feminist phenomenology to introduce 'proximity' as a governing concept for understanding expert sociality and digital surveillance. Child protection operates in a global affective economy of fear, in which the risk of violence is always anticipated and close. The new global policing network keeps exploitation proximate through the humanitarian ideology of emancipation that motivates child protection, and through publicity of technological campaigns, in order to produce public acquiescence to the spectacles of digital surveillance, shaming, and punishment.

N2  - This research studies NYPD Stop and Frisk data from before and after the reopening of the Brooklyn Detention Complex in 2012 to determine whether the introduction of carceral facilities to a neighborhood changes policing habits in the area. This research hopes to aid in wider discussions of devolution as a means for decarceration by answering an important question about the impacts of neighborhood siting. Though the research was inspired by the policy decision to close Riker's Island facilities in New York, the question of devolution is not limited to one city. Ultimately the research aims to help U.S. organizations and political officials interested in carceral devolution to better understand possible ramifications of neighborhood facilities. The main methodology for this research is quantitative analysis of pre-existing data applied to the natural experiment of the reopening of a neighborhood carceral facility. The NYPD publically hosts datasets for its "Stop, Question, and Frisk" program from 2003-2018 on the nyc.gov website. Within that timeframe, the Brooklyn Detention Complex reopened after years of inactivity. Methods focus on time disparity and difference in difference comparisons. The time from disparity and distance from facility are used as independent variables to form a gradient approach to analysis. Dependent and grouping variables describe characteristics of police behavior, including the number of stops, frequency of use of force, and race of persons stopped. I hypothesize that police behavior will become more aggressive near carceral facilities immediately after opening, in the form of a greater number of stops and arrests and a higher propensity toward using force. I also hypothesize an increase in the racial bias of these behaviors. Ultimately, I find few changes in police behavior apart from a consistent increase in officer use of force localized to the precinct home to the facility.

N2  - The underground has been typically viewed as a utilitarian space of expansion. Modernism has required an infrastructural underground, seen as a space of necessity. Historically, the underground has been a place of ceremony and ritual, an otherworldly escape from reality, inhabited by the literary, carceral or religious. The contemporary city calls for a reassertion of this ceremonial underground, extending beyond the infrastructural impulse. With populations rising, and land a finite commodity, the body and city call for a new space- unachievable at grade. The city with its many noises, sights and smells needs filtration. This thesis invites an exploration of the underground, and brings into question conventional disciplinary acts of representation. Working within the underground requires a different set of architectural operations. The underground offers a freedom from existing architectural conventions. Carving becomes the tool of the architect, as the underground relies on excavation to create space. The underground becomes a zone of expression, whose qualities releases us from the banality of orthogonality, as it is a substance that must be carved. The underground enables the refusal of the rationalization of the city. While mediating the path of the person the underground public space offers a sensorium to explore, not a labyrinth to merely follow. This proposal allows for different experiential conditions not found typically at grade, through manipulations of the perception of light, sound, materiality and depth. In working within the constraints of no light or air, and construction by subtraction, architectures of transition become how one moves through the project. Thinking underground is an exercise in total interiority, and provides an opportunity for reorienting the senses, through sequencing, light and scale. Entering the world of the subterranean subverts the visual dependency, as physical sensation underpins spatial cognition. This thesis positions the underworld as an unadulterated, highly stimulating and sensorial experience.

N2  - In California, up to 40 percent of the state's firefighters are incarcerated people working in a prison labor program called the Conservation Camp Program at small, rural prisons known as "fire camps." There are 43 fire camps throughout the state that house up to 4,500 incarcerated people and are largely co-managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). Each year, California's incarcerated firefighters provide approximately three million person-hours responding to fires and other emergencies and are paid between $2 a day and $2 an hour when on the fireline. Historically, the labor movement has opposed the use of prison labor, which was seen as a source of wage competition, job replacement, and strikebreaking "scabs," but since the establishment of fire camps during World War II, California's professional firefighters have acquiesced to this pervasive use of prison labor in their otherwise unionized field. As a result, California's firefighting labor force is divided between free and incarcerated, represented and not represented. Through interviews with unionized and formerly incarcerated firefighters, this thesis interrogates the labor market dynamics that contribute to the acquiescence of organized labor to this prison labor program and articulates the implications of this divided workforce on incarcerated workers who perform dangerous work for the state in a carceral context. As a workforce, California's incarcerated firefighters face heightened risks and fewer benefits than unionized firefighters, while dramatically reducing the cost of fire protection for the state. The implications of this research also extend to the possible impacts of reliance on this captive workforce on the state's fire management and criminal justice policy. Existing scholarship on prison labor endeavors to understand its role as rehabilitation or punishment in the larger system of incarceration. This research seeks to position prison labor as labor, underscoring its impact on the labor market on the "outside" and the critical need for prisoner workers' representation and workers' rights, especially in the context of dangerous work.

N2  - This book offers a broad international analysis of healthcare corruption, drawing upon criminology, sociology, psychology, law, political and behavioural economics and nudge theory. It engages with the existing key debates on how to define healthcare corruption and the measurement of it but builds on this and offers new analysis of these issues in the private healthcare sector too. Furthermore, it moves beyond the analysis of funds lost to healthcare and includes the impact and costs of healthcare corruption on victims and family members of victims and the CJS. It also uniquely considers that the healthcare sector victimizes patients and its own employees, with the healthcare sector as part of a carceral state to help highlight how different disciplines can contribute to our understanding in reducing healthcare corruption.

N2  - This book examines the prominent place a commitment to social justice and equity has occupied in the global history of literary journalism. With international case studies, it explores and theorizes the way literary journalists have addressed inequality and its consequences in their practice. In the process, this volume focuses on the critical attitude the writers of this genre bring to their stories, the immersive reporting they use to gain detailed and intimate knowledge of their subjects, and the array of innovative rhetorical strategies through which they represent those encounters. The contributors explain how these strategies encourage readers to respond to injustices of class, race, indigeneity, gender, mobility, and access to knowledge. Together, they make the case that, throughout its history, literary journalism has proven uniquely well adapted to fusing facts with feeling in a way which makes it a compelling force for social change.

N2  - Dramatic statements about the promise and peril of artificial intelligence for humanity abound, as an industry of experts claims that AI is poised to reshape nearly every sphere of life. Who profits from the idea that the age of AI has arrived? Why do ideas of AI’s transformative potential keep reappearing in social and political discourse, and how are they linked to broader political agendas?Yarden Katz reveals the ideology embedded in the concept of artificial intelligence, contending that it both serves and mimics the logic of white supremacy. He demonstrates that understandings of AI, as a field and a technology, have shifted dramatically over time based on the needs of its funders and the professional class that formed around it. From its origins in the Cold War military-industrial complex through its present-day Silicon Valley proselytizers and eager policy analysts, AI has never been simply a technical project enabled by larger data and better computing. Drawing on intimate familiarity with the field and its practices, Katz instead asks us to see how AI reinforces models of knowledge that assume white male superiority and an imperialist worldview. Only by seeing the connection between artificial intelligence and whiteness can we prioritize alternatives to the conception of AI as an all-encompassing technological force.Bringing together theories of whiteness and race in the humanities and social sciences with a deep understanding of the history and practice of science and computing, Artificial Whiteness is an incisive, urgent critique of the uses of AI as a political tool to uphold social hierarchies.

N2  - Carl Abbott, who has taught urban studies and urban planning in five decades, brings together urban studies and literary studies to examine how fictional cities in work by authors as different as E.M. Forster, Isaac Asimov, Kim Stanley Robinson, and China Mieville might help us to envision an urban future that is viable and resilient. 'Imagining Urban Futures' is a remarkable treatise on what is best and strongest in urban theory and practice today, as refracted and intensely imagined in science fiction. As the human population grows, we can envision an increasingly urban society. Shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels, reduced access to resources, and a host of other issues will radically impact urban environments, while technology holds out the dream of cities beyond Earth. Abbott delivers a compelling critical discussion of science fiction cities found in literary works, television programs, and films of many eras from 'Metropolis' to 'Blade Runner' and 'Soylent Green' to 'The Hunger Games', among many others.

In this book, Dana Simmons explores the enduring production of hunger in US history. Hunger, in the modern United States, became a technology--a weapon, a scientific method, and a policy instrument. During the nineteenth century, state agents and private citizens colluded in large-scale campaigns of ethnic cleansing using hunger and food deprivation. In the twentieth century, officials enacted policies and rules that made incarcerated people, welfare recipients, and beneficiaries of foreign food aid hungry by design, in order to modify their behavior. With the advent of ultraprocessed foods, food manufacturers designed products to stimulate cravings and consumption at the expense of public health. Taking us inside the labs of researchers devoted to understanding hunger as a biological and social phenomenon, On Hunger examines the continuing struggle to produce, suppress, or control hunger in America.

N2  - As we move deeper into the twenty-first century, power, lethal force, and injustice continue to explode violently into war, and the prospects for lasting peace look even bleaker. The horrors of modern warfare - the death, dehumanization, and destruction of social and material infrastructures - have done little to bring an end to armed conflict.  In this volume, leading chroniclers of war provide thoughtful and powerful essays that reflect on their ethnographic work at the frontlines. The contributors recount not only what they have seen and heard in war zones but also what is being rea

Herself a porn performer and participant, Stardust takes readers behind the scenes, offering intimate insights into this socio-political movement. She finds politicians who watch porn in parliament, protesters leading face-sitting demonstrations, sex workers making COVID-safe pornography, and artists reverse-engineering porn detection software. Against the backdrop of a global gig economy, Stardust documents the promises of indie porn to democratize content, revolutionize production, and redistribute wealth while outlining the fantasies of regulators, whose illusions of what porn is and does foreclose possibilities for transformation. Inevitably, as these paradigms collide, porn producers engage in creative tactics to hustle for survival and visibility, from ethical certification to law reform, sometimes reproducing hierarchies of stigma themselves. By highlighting how porn stigma is bound up with intersecting oppressions, Stardust identifies these junctions as coalitional opportunities for changing social relationships to sex, work, and capitalism"-- Provided by publisher.

N2  - The early writings of renowned poet and critical theorist Jackie Wang, drawn from her early zines, indie-lit crit, and prolific early 2000s blog. Wang is a poet, scholar, multimedia artist, and Assistant Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California. She is the author of the poetry collection The Sunflower Cast a Spell to Save Us from the Void (2021), which was a finalist for the National Book Award; the critical essay collection Carceral Capitalism (Semiotext(e), 2018); and the chapbooks The Twitter Hive Mind Is Dreaming (2018) and Tiny Spelunker of the Oneiro-Womb (2016). Her research is on racial capitalism, surveillance technology, and the political economy of prisons and police. Compiled as a field guide, travelogue, essay collection, and weather report, Alien Daughters Walk into the Sun traces Jackie Wang's trajectory from hard femme to Harvard, from dumpster dives and highway bike rides to dropping out of an MFA program, becoming a National Book Award finalist, and writing her trenchant book Carceral Capitalism. Alien Daughters charts the dream-seeking misadventures of an "odd girl" from Florida who emerged from punk houses and early Tumblr to become the powerful writer she is today. Anarchic and beautifully personal, Alien Daughters is a strange intellectual autobiography that demonstrates Wang's singular self-education: an early life lived where every day and every written word began like the Tarot's Fool, with a leap of faith."--from MIT Press website.

N2  - "During the postwar period, experiments on prison populations were standard practice among many universities, public health agencies, and major pharmaceutical manufacturers across the United States. Thus, the operative question in Skin Theory is: What was it about the US prison that made it so amenable to medical science research? A visual study for critically understanding entwined sites of imprisonment and scientific knowledge production, Skin Theory speaks directly to the crucial moments immediately before two large American industries, one carceral and the other pharmaceutical, saw their fantastic rise and dominance, honing in on when their interests and operations came together in explicit ways. It revisits the notorious dermatological experiments conducted between 1952 and 1974 at Holmesburg Prison, Philadelphia, analyzing skin in its technological, spatial, and discursive dimensions to illustrate a profound antagonism between knowledge and freedom made visible through the body of the captive test subject, a racialized subject whose boundless availability to scientific and cultural representation complicates the very notion of skin. This study offers an important reframing of critical approaches to race in histories of science, medicine, and technology, redefining science as already a fundamentally racial project. A visual analysis of how medical science and incarceration together formed a race-making technology and geography reconfiguring the nation's long history of captivity, from slavery to mass incarceration, Skin Theory shifts from issues of scientific racism to the scientific rationality of racism itself"-- Provided by publisher.

These groups-composed of and advocating for "criminal aliens," or migrants with criminal records as well as their families and allies-are fighting not for reform or a simple path to legalization, but for the transformation of a settler colonial immigration infrastructure that increasingly surveils, detains, and deports migrants. Through fieldwork as a participant-observer with four groups-Families For Freedom in New York City, Khmer Girls in Action in Long Beach, a Los Angeles-based short-term coalition Tod@s Somos Arizona, and the Los Angeles area Immigrant Youth Coalition-Monisha Das Gupta reveals how these groups build expansive political coalitions and fight for rights without appealing to inclusion in the settler state. Bridging studies of settler colonialism, migration, and abolition, Das Gupta highlights the transformative promise offered by dissident migrant-led politics"-- Provided by publisher.

N2  - This book explores and addresses body search practices in prison environments from different angles (criminology, sociology, human rights and law) and discusses such practices in different national contexts within Europe. Body searches are widely used in prison systems across the globe: they are perceived as indispensable to prevent forbidden substances, weapons or communication devices from entering the prison. However, these are also invasive and potentially degrading control techniques. It should not come as a surprise, then, that body searches are deeply contested security measures and that they have been widely debated and regulated. What makes theses control measures problematic in a prison context? How do these practices come to be regulated in an international and European context? How are rules translated into national law? To what extent are laws and rules respected, bent, circumvented and denied? And what does the future hold for body searches? Tom Daems is Professor of Criminology at the Leuven Institute of Criminology (LINC), KU Leuven, Belgium. At LINC, he coordinates the research line on 'Punishment and Control'. Daems has published widely on punishment and prisons, in particular from a European perspective. With Palgrave, he previously published Electronic Monitoring: Tagging Offenders in a Culture of Surveillance (2020) and Europe in Prisons: Assessing the Impact of European Institutions on National Prison Systems (2017, co-edited with Luc Robert). .

N2  - "On December 12, 2019, the Chicago Architecture Biennial invited us to organize an event around our book The Funambulist by its Readers: Political Geographies from Chicago and Elsewhere. We had the luck and honor to hold this event with the five Chicago-based activists (Patricia Nguyen, Jesse Mumm, Maira Khwaja, Benji Hart, and Anjulie Rao) we commissioned specifically for this book to describe the political struggles they have been a part of against the municipality's policing, neoliberal and racist policies, in particular during the two terms of Rahm Emmanuel (who was one of the initiators of the Chicago Architecture Biennial). This event was a renewed opportunity for us to reflect on our participation to the biennial, shared between a clear adhesion to the statement drafted by its 2019 curators (Yesomi Umolu, Sepake Angiama and Paulo Tavares) and the normalization of the politics enacted by the municipality of Chicago as well as the biennial's main sponsor, BP. Patricia Nguyen is an artist, educator, and scholar. She is Director of Undergraduate Studies and Assistant Professor of Instruction in Asian American Studies at Northwestern University, where she received her PhD in Performance Studies. Her work explores forced migration, political economy, carceral states, torture, and nationbuilding. She has published in Women Studies Quarterly, Harvard Kennedy School's Asian American Policy Review, and Women and Performance. She has exhibited and performed at the Nha San Collective Vietnam, Mission Cultural Center, Jane Addams Hull House, Prague Quadrennial, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Chile. Her contribution is called "Building a Monumental Anti-Monument: The Chicago Torture Justice Memorial Project." Jesse Mumm is a cultural anthropologist teaching in Latin American and Latino Studies at DePaul University, with a doctorate in anthropology from Northwestern University. He has won grants from the National Science Foundation, and teaching awards for his work in urban ethnography interrogating issues of race and racism. He grew up in Chicago, went to public schools, and taught high school at the Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He has been involved in critical pedagogy, solidarity work, immigrant and refugee rights, community development, and social justice for 30 years. His original fieldwork asked: how does gentrification reveal and construct race? His contribution is called "Battle for the Near Northwest Side: Ground Zero in the Chicago Gentrification War." Maira Khwaja is an educator and multimedia producer based in Chicago, Illinois. At the Invisible Institute, a non-profit investigative journalism production company on the South Side, she interviews young people about their experiences with police, produces events and work-shops, and guides outreach communications. She co-directs a political education project, called TM Productions, to engage traditionally disenfranchised Chicagoans in civic conversations. Maira is a first generation Pakistani-American, born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She studied history at the University of Chicago, focusing on the relationships between gangs and churches on the South Side of Chicago. Her contribution is called "Policing Grief in Chicago: Restrained Mobility and Surveillance on Social Media." Benji Hart is an author, artist, and educator from Amherst, MA, living in Chicago. The writer behind the blog Radical Faggot, their essays have been anthologized in Rebellious Mourning: The Collective Work of Grief (2017) and Taking Sides: Radical Solidarity and the Poverty of Liberalism (2015), both from AK Press. Their commentary has been published at Teen Vogue, The Advocate, The Chicago Reader, and others. They have held residencies with the Rauschenberg Foundation (2018), the Arcus Center for Social Justice Leadership (2018), and are the recipient of the 3Arts Award in the Teaching Arts (2015). Their contribution is called "#NoCopAcademy Campaign." Anjulie Rao is a Chicago-based journalist and writer focusing on livable built environments, equitable design, architecture criticism, and radical urbanism. With an academic background in art history, she enjoys intersections between visual art, architecture, infrastructure, and political narratives.

N2  - "A Research Agenda for a Human Rights Centred Criminology makes an excellent contribution to thinking through the complexities and potential interrelationships between human rights and critical criminology. There is an array of approaches in the collection which identify various topics and methods, and mark differing understandings of both criminology and human rights. This collection of essays demonstrates the benefit of and need for more refined and clearly articulated conceptual, methodological and theoretical standpoints." - Chris Cunneen, Professor of Criminology at Jumbunna Institute, University of Technology Sydney, Australia "This is a very welcome addition to the academic literature that engages in dialogue across the fields of criminology and human rights. Its many rich and diverse perspectives on a range of subjects are covered deftly by an exceptional collection of authors. The book will undoubtedly stimulate further debate and scholarship on these important topics, exactly as the editors intended." - Ursula Kilkelly, Professor of Law at University College Cork, Republic of Ireland This edited collection articulates a future direction for research at the nexus of criminology and human rights by bringing together experts from different branches of criminology and criminal justice who, while they may be sceptical about certain aspects of human rights theory or practice, share an interest in realising many of the objectives set out in human rights instruments. It argues that critical criminological research has a significant role to play in identifying whether state and state-corporate power is exercised in ways that align with human rights law and principles, although the discipline has been slow to advance this agenda. This book covers a wide array of topics and seeks to develop critical human rights approaches within criminology and criminal justice.

N2  - This edited book explores new and enduring themes in the gendered experience of incarceration across the world. Capturing global debates and research on women's treatment, their coping and resistances in penal settings, the collection promotes a feminist agenda that is attuned to the inherently patriarchal and intersectionally oppressive structures of contemporary punishment. It seeks to map policies and campaigns around women's criminalisation across the world and offers one of the most comprehensive overviews of women's imprisonment experiences across the Global North and Global South. Each chapter focusses on a different geographic context and theme and aims to provide the intellectual groundwork for a critical, world-wide movement advocating for women's decarceration. As a whole, the collection offers a robust empirical understanding of women's punishment in non-western, Global South contexts and also revisits ongoing debates in feminist accounts of punishment in the Global North. In doing so, the collection examines hierarchical geopolitical relations between privileged and underprivileged nations, reflecting global inequalities and structural violence rooted in legacies of imperialism and colonialism. Overall, the edited collection shows how centering women's peripheralized experiences can radically reshape our understanding of punishment and offers a new intellectual, methodological, and political means through which to think about gendered identity and imprisonment in the 21st Century.

N2  - Sexual citizenship is a powerful concept associated with debates about recognition and exclusion, agency, respect and accountability. For young people in general and for gender and sexually diverse youth in particular, these debates are entangled with broader imaginings of social transitions: from 'child' to 'adult' and from 'unreasonable subject' to one 'who can consent'. This international and interdisciplinary collection identifies and locates struggles for recognition and inclusion in particular contexts and at particular moments in time, recognising that sexual and gender diverse young people are neither entirely vulnerable nor self-reliant.  Focusing on the numerous domains in which debates about youth, sexuality and citizenship are enacted and contested, Youth, Sexuality and Sexual Citizenship explores young people's experiences in diverse but linked settings: in the family, at school and in college, in employment, in social media and through engagement with health services. Bookended by reflections from Jeffrey Weeks and and Susan Talburt, the book's empirically grounded chapters also engage with the key debates outlined in it's scholarly introduction. This innovative book is of interest to students and scholars of gender and sexuality, health and sex education, and youth studies, from a range of disciplinary and professional backgrounds, including sociology, education, nursing, social work and youth work.

This multi-disciplinary volume presents this revolution within its transnational and global contexts. Moving deftly from the personal to the global and from the provincial to the national, it draws attention to the multiplicity of spaces of the revolution such as streets, schools, prisons, personal lives, and histories such as the Cold War and Global 1960s and 70s. With a broad range of approaches, Global 1979 conceives of the  Iranian Revolution not as exceptional or anachronistic, but as an uprising constituted by multiple, interwoven geographies and histories, which disrupt static and bounded notions of the local, national, regional, and global.

The data is drawn from two large surveys of sex workers' clients in the US and UK. The book presents descriptive baseline data on client engagement with online platforms, demographics and patterns of frequency in different markets, information on smaller niche markets and client reactions to exploitation, safety and changes in the law. The book makes clear that the situational as well as individual factors affect the willingness and ability to purchase sexual services. The view that emerges shatters the stereotypes and generalizations on which much policy is based, and demonstrates the complexities surrounding who pays for sex and the contours of sexual consumption in consumer culture"-- Provided by publisher.

N2  - This volume introduces innovative and inspired qualitative methods through topics on crime commission, victimisation and crime control. It highlights how qualitative methods offer significant insights that frame our understanding of the narratives, events, theoretical perspectives, and realities of the social world. This book includes chapters discussing cutting-edge methods, which demonstrate how qualitative research can expand beyond traditional approaches. It offers diversity in research, including gender, race, and geographic sensitivities. The volume addresses a multitude of approaches for using qualitative methodologies, including innovative uses of technology mediumssuch as social media, participatory videos, Zoom interviewing, and photographic visual methodsas means of collecting and co-producing relevant data on meaning. Ultimately, this book illustrates how qualitative criminology allows for deeper and more nuanced understandings of local and regional specificities in a globalized world, and how social interactions are influenced by individual interpretations, social interactions, and collective decision making. This volume is an essential read for graduate students and researchers in criminology and other social science disciplines interested in qualitative empirical research and informed policy making.

N2  - This book provides a wide-ranging, global exploration of policies and practices which have sought to undermine dissent during recent and less recent social, political, economic and health 'crises'. Examining various cases of activism and opposition from both the Global North and the Global South, and drawing on multi-disciplinary insights, this book analyses the many ways in which state and non-state actors have targeted dissent, activism and protest, including by vulnerable groups. This includes strategies that have silenced dissenting opinions, restricted the right to protest, intensified policing practices and the surveillance of activists, imposed onerous administrative fines, criminalised and prosecuted dissenters, and even killed activists. Fundamentally, this volume considers 'criminalisation' as a process that develops on a continuum of control and repressive practices that aim to undermine dissent. It contributes to the broader discussion on criminalisation processes, policing, the rule of law, and the quality of our democracies.

N2  - Electronic ankle monitors are wearable government surveillance technology devices used in domains such as criminal justice, immigration, public health, and more. People who are required to wear electronic ankle monitors express that they experience shame and stigmatization because of being required to wear this technology due to its strong association with the criminal justice system. This article presents exploratory research of instances where wearers present their ankle monitors online and shares a typology describing a range of observable resistance stories or narrative events in these posts. I describe emergent cultures and practices of aesthetic resistance and reclamation practices carried out by the wearer community. This research highlights the acute need to center the voices, acts, and experiences of people and communities rendered vulnerable by technology design and deployment.

N2  - Federal prisons in the early 20th century used the technology of radio for distinct ends. The prison at Atlanta facilitated a broadcast concert at the local radio station, with an entirely incarcerated band. At Leavenworth, in Kansas, a warden tried to maintain control over his facility by permitting long radio listening hours for prisoners through individual headsets wired into cells rather than in areas where people could gather. Meanwhile, prison educators believed radio to be a powerful tool in their mission to reform their subjects. This moment of indetermination-for both radio and the new Federal Bureau of Prisons-offers insight into the role of media in the practice of incarceration, as well as in the struggle against it.

N2  - This article counters the view (albeit contested) of race as a natural empirical object with technology as a secondary, external entity applied to it. Instead, I posit race itself as a technology that is inherently discriminatory in motivation, design and function, as evident throughout its brutally effective history. Focusing on the post/genomic era, I consider contemporary forms of molecular racialization as the latest technological iteration of race as a disciplinary device. I characterize this biopolitical racial technology as operant through a carceral methodology in four stages: (a) the epistemological mutability of molecular racialization as reiterating the obscurantist claim of modern raciology to constitute a benign description of literal racial difference; (b) the ontological de‐individualization of certain racial others as aggregated risky populations and legitimate targets of repressive management; (c) a predictive empiricism whereby molecular race is seen as indicative of potential behaviours that sanctions oppressive state interventions against specific populations; (d) a normative bioethical dissembling whereby state agencies' exploitation of target molecular racialized populations' vulnerabilities result in the debarment of proper ethical consideration and the right to justice. Drawing largely on criminal justice and immigration control examples, the article asserts that the carceral methodologies of molecular racialization demonstrate race as a repressive technology designed to (re)produce subaltern racial populations and propagate racism.

N2  - This inquiry explores how data analyses about US Federal sentences have transformed sentencing practice beginning in the mid-1980s. I consider this inquiry an early case of the datafication of law, a pervasive process that translates legal practice into data and embeds it in digital networks so it can be tracked and analyzed in real time. To explore datafication historically and in relation to legal practice and power, I consider it not as an objective and passive undertaking but, rather, as an ideological and performative process that encodes and enacts normative presumptions and desirable futures. The empirical inquiry traverses “levels of analysis” and thus bridges prominent perspectives in sociolegal research. In so doing, I identify four mechanisms that mediate “large-scale” processes and “local” practices: field assembly, symbolic projection, material inscription, and boundaries spanning. Substantively, I show how datafication has not simply described, but also transformed, sentencing practice according to a colorblind-carceral imaginary that strives to fix the present in place. By relentlessly translating decisions into data forms that derive from this carceral imaginary, datafication affects judicial action and partakes in sustaining legacies of oppression. Yet, like other technologies, datafication also reveals dialectic dimensions in opening up to new actors and subjecting its ideological underpinnings to contestation and change.

N2  - How do we advance social justice in an increasingly datafied world? Against a backdrop of burgeoning social movements, data-driven technologies have become an important terrain of struggle. That’s because the design and implementation of technology is not simply about the creation of software and hardware objects, but the negotiation of practices and possibilities for living life together differently (Suchman 2007). In this dissertation, I examine the role of technology in shaping our collective imaginations of what is possible in the context of the carceral state. By carceral state, I mean the expansive system of state-sanctioned capture, confinement, and control that underpins our current unjust social order. Drawing on rich intellectual traditions such as feminist, Indigenous, and Black studies, I interrogate the default assumptions underlying the design and implementation of data-intensive systems, in order to fundamentally reimagine the role of technology in larger struggles for justice. Ultimately, the aim of this work is to experiment with ways of “un-inventing” (MacKenzie 1993) carceral technology, by reconfiguring the structural, interpersonal, and personal aspects of computation to the point that harmful algorithms are no longer created.

N2  - My dissertation, Designed to Shame: Electronic Ankle Monitors and the Politics of Carceral Technologies, examines the ways that the design and use of electronic ankle monitors perpetuate and extend the punitive values of the US criminal justice system. Digital “alternatives to incarceration,” like ankle monitors, purport to be innovative and humanizing tools that alleviate mass imprisonment and allow for reintegration into society. My research looks at how the hardware and software design choices behind electronic ankle monitor development work to undercut the otherwise humanizing aims of such devices.In Chapter Two (“The Ethics of Aesthetics”), I share my examination of ankle monitors’ “form factor” (the physical size and shape of ankle monitor computing hardware) and how it has come to mark wearers as justice-involved in the eyes of community members. In Chapter Three (“Make it Work”), I share empirical observations and analyses from 85 semi-structured interviews, along with multi-sited fieldwork observations at corrections conventions and industry offices. I describe the range of articulation work that actors in communities spanning design and vending firms and criminal justice units and departments engage in to make the technology usable according to their needs.In Chapter Four (“Calling Out Creep”), I describe cultures and process of ankle monitor adoption and use and argue for recognizing this history of adoption as layered instances of “surveillance creep” — a term for when surveillance systems assume uses for which they were not initially intended. Drawing on this history, I describe four central characteristics and conditions of surveillance creep and advocate that the ability to identify characteristics of creep is crucial to fomenting efforts to address, stall, and stop creep.Finally, in Chapter Five (“Bedazzle, Inscribe, Flaunt”) I describe the cultures of resistance that circulate in response to electronic ankle monitor design and use. I found that wearers engage in forms of visual, aesthetic resistance that seek to shape and alter public perceptions of the technology’s symbolic meaning, without disrupting monitors’ technological operation. I spotlight how ankle monitor wearers use media to change the narrative meaning of the monitor from stigma to empowerment, and to critique state and institutional use of these devices. Overall, my dissertation research seeks to understand the broader social consequences of using electronic ankle monitors to augment community-based supervision, and whether the design of such technologies meet the social and policy objectives driving their creation and adoption.

N2  - This article explores the effect that communications technology has on hegemonic power. The first section establishes a theoretical framework combining Foucault’s carceral archipelago theory with Chiara Bottici’s concept of the social imaginal describing the medium through which inter- and trans-subjective imagination occurs. The remainder employs this framework to examine how four technological innovations (print media, radio, television and Internet) impact the (re)production of discursive hegemonic ideology, integrating a variety of historical and contemporary theories on public discourse and ideological dominance. I conclude by arguing that each case demonstrates a dialectic pattern that explains the techno-social evolution of the carceral archipelago.

N2  - The UK government's Transforming Our Justice System agenda represents an emerging system of penal governance. Its cumulative impact, manifested through the mainstreaming of virtual hearings, a system of automatic online convictions and the Single Justice Procedure is a story yet to tell, with the potential impact on marginalised women simply a footnote. Such women, well-documented victims of the legal aid cuts as well as the digital divide, must comply with and negotiate the requirements of the carceral web alone. Pursuance of the reforms, representing the next instalment in the neo-liberal justice agenda, exposes another example of life at the penal–welfare nexus. This precarious territory has burgeoned since government-imposed austerity, with implications for self-criminalisation, net-widening and social justice. Reforms couched in the language of ‘efficiency’ and ‘common sense’ are likely to run in direct opposition to what marginalised women might need (or respond well to) and may jeopardise official reductionist strategies.

However, critics highlight significant human rights concerns in smart prisons, noting that AI-driven technologies amplify carceral surveillance, invade privacy and perpetuate biased profiling, exacerbating the psychological, mental and physical conditions of both prisoners and their communities. Drawing on emerging literature, global trends and practical examples, the article investigates how AI gradually changes the dynamics of both carceral communication and the future of penal justice at large.

N2  - ABSTRACT
This systematic literature review synthesizes published sources from the ASIS&T Digital Library and the ACM Digital Library to develop a definition of the carceral state and to show how the term has been used in contemporary technology‐focused research. The carceral state concept has been adopted and applied widely in multiple areas of social scientific research to refer to the formal institutions of the criminal justice system proper and other social arrangements, ideologies, practices, and technologies that punish, surveil, and contain populations. Our review reveals a recent and increasing engagement with the carceral state in the collections surveyed. Encouraged by this increasing attention, this review is an attempt to introduce the carceral state as a guiding framework for tech‐society research and to consider implications for advancing responsibility, reflexivity, and care in the creation and evaluation of information systems, programs, and services.

N2  - This article asks: How do formerly incarcerated people navigate digital technologies? Using the metaphor of a spider web, I use 18 months of ethnographic observations of formerly incarcerated women of color to argue that formerly incarcerated people must contend with what I call—Carceral Web—the spatial intersection between carceral institutions and digital technologies. I identify two primary features of the Carceral Web: stickiness and entanglements. I characterize stickiness as the Internet’s ability to make carceral histories inescapable across time and physical space, making it impossible for formerly incarcerated people to shed their criminal histories. I characterize entanglements as the intersections of institutional carceral relationships that result from practices and norms of digital connectivity. I argue that the pervasive significance of digital connectivity to everyday life compels formerly incarcerated people to contend with the Carceral Web, but stickiness and entanglements make them susceptible to exploitation and reincarceration. I call the Carceral Web’s production of vulnerable subjects predation, which I characterize as a type of hidden sentence. I contend that despite having limited resources to navigate predation, formerly incarcerated people are tasked with co-opting the Carceral Web to build solidarity and training as a self-defense survival mechanism. Understanding the Spider of the Carceral Web as the convergence of corporations and state interests allows us to see how it feeds on the lives of formerly incarcerated people by consuming their marginalization and exclusion in the interests of racialized and gendered profit.

N2  - The issue of illicit drugs in correctional institutions is a complex and growing concern, facing the deployment of renewed and ingenious smuggling techniques, which even manage to bypass the highly secured and monitored carceral setting. In order to disrupt the circulation of drug-related contraband inside prison walls, correctional systems have traditionally used intrusive and degrading body search practices as the main drug detection strategy. A technological solution seems particularly promising, by substituting invasive practices for security and control devices and by offering a compromise between the safety of the institution and individual rights. However, the use of technological devices is not neutral or static. Their introduction in correctional settings reveals underlying logic and mechanisms which produce norms and unexpected effects that must be analysed and understood before considering any technological solution. Drawing from a Canadian research about incarcerated people’s privacy, this chapter  discusses through a socio-technical perspective the prospect of a technological solution that could possibly reconcile the imperative of securing prisons on the one hand and of protecting the privacy and dignity of the incarcerated persons on the other. Drawing from the analysis of a peculiar technology, the Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS), we shed a light on the painful and emotional experiences of body searches  and discuss technology as a potential solution and alternative to this daily practice.   By observing not a substitution but a reinforcement of body search practices, despite the use of technology we interrogate the politics and managerial rationalities which underly the choice of a specific device, leading to the (re)configuration and the appropriation of its functionalities and reflecting the socio-politics representations of the issue at stake.

N2  - This article draws together science and technology studies and critical race theory to examine the proliferation and intensification of carceral approaches to governing human life. It argues for an expansive understanding of “the carceral” that extends well beyond the domain of policing, to include forms of containment that make innovation possible in the contexts of health and medicine, education and employment, border policies and virtual realities. In interrogating the relationship between innovation and containment, it urges scholars to consider, who and what are fixed in place––classified, corralled, and/or coerced—to enable technoscientific development? Finally, it proposes the cultivation of an abolitionist consciousness that fosters human agency and freedom with and against sciences and technologies.

N2  - As an ideology and practice, carceral conservationism enforces an environmental paradigm that partitions lawai'a and homeless people from the environment. In doing so, it interrupts, manages, and criminalizes ways of life for those who live in intimate relationship to the land and ocean as a mode of identity and survival. While it does not prevent subsistence activities at Ka'ena, carceral conservationism represents a mode of state-based land tenure that accommodates lifestyles premised on capitalist consumption rather than subsistence, solidarity, and informal exchange. Whether or not the fence has effectively protected wildlife, carceral conservationism at Ka'ena represents a crystallization of the widespread fencing that characterized martial law during World War II, the rise of the security state and concomitant escalation of its putative dimensions, and the growth of the tourist complex. As a product of the confluence of militarization and tourism, carceral conservationism also propels both projects.

N2  - The Carceral Media Regime follows a range of media technologies through their implementation in the US prison system over the last century: radio, mail, solitary confinement, telephone, cell phones, and digital tablets. As a series of media histories, each chapter tracks the specific conditions and effects of its media technological innovation at a different moment in the prison regime’s tumultuous history, affording different and often unforeseen uses for both captors and captives.As a more continuous history of the prison and the prisoners’ movement, the dissertation follows recurrent problems and contradictions across the prison’s implementation of media technologies. A central contradiction of the prison becomes visible in its media technological systems as multiple opposed groups mobilize the same technologies for radically different goals. Prison reformers and reformist administrators have historically plied prison media for educational and “rehabilitative” projects, while more revanchist wardens and guards have deployed them for punishment, torture, and more coercive forms of repression. They find agreement in their support of total surveillance. Meanwhile prisoners, and in particular imprisoned radicals, revolutionaries, and abolitionists, have used, evaded, produced, and hacked prison media systems for political education projects, better access to family and friends, and for what Stephen Wilson calls “dis-organizing the prison.” These contradictory affordances of prison media technology register (again) the prison and its media regime as sites of warfare so asymmetric that it can be difficult to recognize key moments of resistance against it. The Carceral Media Regime’s media historical approach opens new archives and methods for locating and understanding the prison regime and prisoners’ movements. The dissertation insists on the urgency of struggles over prison media technologies, from mailroom rules to digital tablet setup, as struggles over the very conditions of possibility for building and maintaining a strong prisoners’ movement. What appears to be a haphazard constellation of media systems coheres in the carceral media regime that isolates individuals, disaggregates groups, stymies prisoner organization, and endlessly strives to pacify rebellion inside and outside the prison.

N2  - Despite longstanding implicit recognition of the significance of prison space, which can be traced back at least as far as Bentham's notion, introduced in 1791, that prisoner reform and wellbeing are achieved in part by a 'simple idea in architecture', prison architecture, design and technology (ADT) remain under-researched and poorly theorized. This exploratory paper reviews some of the literature on carceral space, principally from human geography, but also from criminology and environmental psychology. It poses questions which point to the pertinence of research into prison design at a critical juncture in penal policy in the UK, as the Ministry of Justice rolls out a 'new for old' policy, closing down at least thirteen historic prisons and partially closing several other sites, and commissioning new, large custodial facilities which appear to represent a return to previously shelved plans for warehouse-style 'Titan' prisons. The paper argues that carceral geography's concern for the lived experience of spaces of imprisonment could provide a unique and insightful perspective on this critical area of scholarship, and suggests new areas for future research which could generate the empirical material necessary to research this critical topic. Malgré une reconnaissance implicite ancienne de l'importance de l'espace de la prison, remontant au moins à la conception de Bentham datant de 1791 et selon laquelle la transformation morale et le bien être du prisonnier peuvent être réalisés en partie dans et par l'architecture, l'aménagement et les techniques architecturales déployées en milieu carcéral, demeurent sous investis et insuffisamment théorisés. Cet article exploratoire passe en revue la littérature sur l'espace carcéral, principalement issue de la géographie humaine, mais aussi de la criminologie et de la psychologie environnementale. Il questionne la pertinence de la recherche consacrée à la conception de la prison à un moment crucial où le ministre britannique de la justice déploie un programme déjà ancien, présenté comme nouveau cependant, et qui consiste à fermer six prisons historiques, à fermer partiellement trois autres sites et à planifier la construction de nouvelles structures de grande taille semblant augurer d'un retour aux prisons gigantesques sur le modèle « des dépôt de prisonniers ». Cet article démontre que l'intérêt de la géographie carcérale pour la dimension vécue des espaces d'emprisonnement peut fournir une contribution pertinente et originale dans ce champ d'analyses critiques et suggère de nouvelles pistes de recherche destinées à la production de nouvelles données empiriques sur ce sujet sensible.

N2  - This article provides an analysis of sonic protest strategies used by anti-carceral feminist coalitions in Melbourne, Australia. Our research demonstrates that sound is a particularly powerful boundary-crosser that can challenge the exclusionary spatial ordering of the prison. Under certain political and geographical conditions, the carceral soundscape, which increasingly restricts ‘who gets to hear what’, can be temporarily breached, altered and re-made by protest noise, rhythm and music, and radio technology. Counter-carceral acoustemologies create alternative ‘soundtracks’ of resistance that both reveal and momentarily displace carceral-spatial control, re-patterning the aural environment of the prison. Such breaches can be countered, however, by various modes of boundary fortification over time. We propose that a more nuanced understanding of carceral space and soundscapes—as relational and in flux—provides greater opportunities for denaturalizing the prison and challenging its seeming permanence in our political and cultural landscapes.

N2  - The neoliberal era has massified a highly reflexive orientation to the self. We interrogate, brand, determine, and discipline our selves within structures of governance that recognize and demand our responsibility and self-determination. Where Marxian political economists emphasize the breaking of the twentieth-century class compacts and the steady abandonment of the majority to precariousness, the Foucauldian literature on governmentality tends to concentrate on the successful interpellation of the more industrialized countries into new political-economic orders. The idea of a transition from disciplinary governance into marketized self-management is a valuable ideal type and analytical tool, provided it is not turned into a sweeping summary of contemporary social control-for example, by squeezing the spectacularly violent experiment of mass incarceration into the trope of actuarial risk management. Within this shifting field of addiction governance, no form holds greater variation than the central institution of rehab.

N2  - This paper considers the site of the modern airport as a space of biopower that facilitates and manages risk by subjecting Muslim travelers to more intense levels of scrutiny than others. I consider Canadian airports, in particular, as spaces that not only facilitate and perpetuate the production of racialized knowledges and practices of racial profiling against Canadian Muslims, but, moreover, as race-based, spatial enclosures that produce what I refer to as the 'anxiety of stuckedness.' Despite the rapid evolution of automated and biometric systems, which are now found in many airports across the globe, and are often touted as race-neutral technologies (Bigo 2006), I argue that the airport's security and surveillance infrastructure attempt to conceal old and new logics of colonialism and governmentality within the invisibility of transnational databases, data flows and, increasingly, biometric systems.

N2  - This review considers a range of literature that contributes to a critical conversation encompassing radical opposition to the Carceral State and its logics, practices, and technologies. The carceral concept has been adopted and applied to multiple areas of the social world. With few exceptions, the term “Carceral State” has been used by many scholars without a comprehensive or agreed definition of the concept. This review is an attempt to piece together various pieces of literature that offer theoretical explorations of mass incarceration, as well as, how punishment and the logics of prison have informed economic, political, and social landscapes, compromising what has been identified by many scholars as a Carceral State.

N2  - In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officially launched its online locator system, an internet‐based public tool designed to assist attorneys, family members, and interested entities in locating detained individuals in ICE custody. In November 2019, Freedom For Immigrants (FFI), an immigrant rights organization, conducted surveys of individuals and organizations attempting to locate detainees and found 698 instances of migrants disappearing from the online locator system, with the search stating “zero matching records.” With this in mind, this essay explores technologies of invisibility of the carceral web through ethnographic observation and testimonies collected in immigration detention. I use the term “carceral web” by Susila Gurusami to refer to the spatial intersection between carceral institutions and digital technologies that unveil the entanglements and workings of the carceral edgelands. I argue that the ICE locator system, a public tool for migrant identification and placement, not only showcases state‐enforced disappearance but reveals a process of invisibilization and structural violence temporally and spatially at work.

N2  - In spite of a growing interest in ethical approaches to computation, engineers and quantitative researchers are often not equipped with the conceptual tools necessary to interrogate, resist, and reimagine the relationships of power which shape their work. A liberatory vision of computation requires de-centering the data in “data ethics” in favor of cultivating an ethics of encounter that foregrounds the ways computation reproduces structures of domination. This article draws from a rich body of feminist scholarship that explores the liberatory potential of refusal as a practice of generative boundary setting. To refuse is to say no—to reject the default categories, assumptions and problem formulations which so often underpin data-intensive work. But refusal is more than just saying no; it can be a generative and strategic act, one which opens up space to renegotiate the assumptions underlying sociotechnical endeavors. This article explores two complementary modalities of refusal in computation: “refusal as resistance” and “refusal as re-centering the margins.” By exploring these two modes of refusal, the goal of this paper is to provide a vocabulary for identifying and rejecting the ways that sociotechnical systems reinforce dependency on oppressive structural conditions, as well as offer a framework for flexible collective experimentation towards more free futures.

N2  - The practice of identifying people by ID numbers rather than their names, which the authors term here "numbering," has been extensively recorded in carceral and bordering institutions. While the argument for using identification numbers (ID numbers) is that they enable the reliable mapping between a person and designated institutional artifacts, according to people who have been subjected to numbering, its effect is to dehumanize, erasing individuals' identities so that they might be more effectively abused as objects. To explore these logics, our article provides a critical reading of Boat IDs in Australia's notorious border regime based on the first-hand accounts of people subjected to numbering. We apply a 'technology-in-practice' lens to analyze ID numbers as biopolitical apparatuses of carceral recognition and erasure that work to materialize power relations of domination and subjugation.

N2  - The effects of imprisonment have been well-documented to go beyond the walls of carceral institutions and beyond the individual subjected to confinement. This article analyzes the expansion of carceral experiences in the lives of family members of Canadian prisoners, focusing on the use of the Ion Mobility Spectrometry device during prison visits. Drawing on testimonies, this article explores how the ion scanner not only affects the experiences of families in carceral spaces but also how the impacts are carried out into their everyday lives outside prison walls. The socialization undergone due to “secondary prisonization” leads family members to adopt a “custodial citizenship” which ultimately shapes how they interact and navigate the world—a citizenship and way of life that is unique to having an incarcerated loved one.

N2  - Ryan analyzes everything from the prison farm to the hunger strike, and from the software companies that win exclusive contracts (which are appallingly unregulated by the FDA or USDA) to supply food to prisoners as cheaply as possible to the dubiously hopeful act of food hacking. Chapter seven, "Digital Character in 'The Scored Society': Fico, Social Networks, and Competing Measurements of Creditworthiness" by Tamara K. Nopper, provides a rigorous history of the credit score as a product (178). According to Nopper, "In the 1960s and 1970s, African Americans and white women called attention to how credit barriers maintained racial and gender hierarchies and pushed for the state to intervene" (172); as a result of this effort the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed, and credit scoring became a part of that new regulation.

N2  - Scholars and policymakers have long debated whether electronic monitoring programs can be understood as a carceral experience. Recent changes to the technology that utilize 24/7 location monitoring through GPS are changing the nature of electronic monitoring. Given these changes, this article revisits the question of the “pains” of electronic monitoring and its comparison to incarceration. I focus on three practices of electronic monitoring programs: home searches, communication monitoring, and long-term data storage to illustrate the ways in which the loss of autonomy, one of Sykes's original pains of imprisonment, is reproduced and remade. Rather than focusing on the aspects of programs that confine or limit the mobility of individuals, I draw on the tradition in carceral geography to consider how these practices recreate carcerality in new spaces and highlight the ways in which the experience of electronic monitoring is made carceral through the privacy intrusions and infringements to the self.

N2  - Refugee camps are among the most prevalent institutional responses to global displacement. Despite a quasi consensus among scholars, activists, and humanitarians that camps are undesirable, and should only ever be temporary, little work has charted the political project and practices of camp abolition that challenge their spatial unfreedom. Rather than life‐supporting spatial technologies of care that unwittingly signal political failures of inclusion, camps form part of a calculated system of “carceral humanitarianism”. This article draws on experiences from Kenya where aid interventions have shaped politics, social dynamics and economic life since the 1990s. Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement serve as empirical windows to explore the limits of institutional decampment and reform policies, while demonstrating that more radical, abolitionist struggles are enacted through everyday mobilisation and acts of fugitivity among refugees themselves. Advancing critical studies of humanitarianism and forced migration, this article contends that only abolishing camps and their carceral logics helps to build more viable, safe, and humane futures for people on the move.
Muhtasari
Kambi za wakimbizi ni moja ya njia za kitaasisi zilizozoeleka kukabiliana na suala la uhamiaji wa kulazimishwa wa kimataifa. Ingawaje kuna muafaka baina ya wanazuoni, wanaharakati, na watetezi wa masuala ya kibinadamu kwamba kambi hazifai, na ziwepo kwa muda mfupi tu, michango michache ya kitaaluma imefafanua mradi wa kisiasa na vitendo vya ukomeshaji kambi ambavyo vinakabili ukosefu wa uhuru. Badala ya kuwa mahali pa kuokoa na kujali maisha—penye mapungufu yaliyosababishwa na sera jumuishi zilizoshindwa—kambi ni sehemu ya mfumo wa makusudi wa misaada ya kibinadamu yenye mrengo wa kiudhibiti. Makala hii inatumia mafunzo kutoka Kenya ambapo misaada imeathiri siasa, mienendo ya jamii na maisha ya kiuchumi tangu 1990. Kambi ya Kakuma na makazi ya Kalobeyei yanatumika kama madirisha halisia kuchunguza mkomo wa kitaasisi katika sera za uondoaji kambi na za kimageuzi, ilihali ninaonyesha kwamba mapambano makali ya ukomeshaji wa kambi yanafanywa kila siku kupitia uhamasishaji na vitendo vya kikimbizi kati ya wakimbizi wenyewe. Katika kuendeleza tafakuri ya kihakiki katika masomo ya mfumo wa kibinadamu na uhamiaji wa kulazimishwa, chapisho hili linadai kwamba njia pekee ya kujenga hatima nzuri, salama na ya kibinadamu kwa watu wanaotoka sehemu moja kwenda nyingine, ni kwa kukomesha kambi na mantiki yake ya kiudhibiti.

N2  - In the current study, we explored the prison design and infrastructural changes that Canadian correctional officers consider to be essential in the construction of a new provincial correctional institution intended to replace Her Majesty's Penitentiary (HMP) in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Analyzing 28 semi‐structured interviews conducted with correctional officers employed at HMP, we found the poor working conditions within HMP are, at least in part, related to the physical design of the prison, including inadequate lighting, poor air quality and temperature, high sound levels, and other spatial limitations. Building on the prison design literature, findings suggest that while prison design requires attention to physical security at the forefront, there are ways to improve the space, recognizing how an uncomfortable workplace and living conditions also pose a potential threat to the well‐being and safety of correctional officers and people who are incarcerated.
Résumé
Dans cette étude, nous explorons l'aménagement et l'architecture des prisons et les changements à ceux‐ci que les agents correctionnels considèrent essentiels. Nous prenons pour exemple la construction d'un nouvel établissement pénitentiaire destiné à remplacer le Her Majesty's Penitentiary (HMP) dans la province de Terre‐Neuve‐et‐Labrador. En analysant les 28 entrevues semi‐structurées menées avec des agents correctionnels employés au HMP, nous avons constaté que les mauvaises conditions de travail sont, au moins en partie, causées par les caractéristiques d'aménagement de la prison, notamment un éclairage inadéquat, une qualité de l'air médiocre, une température inadéquate, des niveaux sonores élevés, etc. En s'appuyant sur la littérature sur l'aménagement des pénitenciers, nos résultats suggèrent que, bien que la conception architecturale des prisons implique une attention prioritaire à la sécurité, il existe des moyens d'améliorer l'organisation de l'espace, reconnaissant qu'un milieu de travail et un lieu de vie inconfortables constituent une menace potentielle au bien‐être et à la sécurité des agents correctionnels et des personnes incarcérées.
Key messages
Correctional officers at HMP believe poor working conditions within the prison in part are affected by the physical design of the prison.
Safety for both officers and prisoners is at risk due to infrastructure, technology, and air quality issues within the prison.
Carceral space, particularly the physical design of a prison, should contribute to the well‐being of all its occupants, prisoner or staff.

It considers what Gerald Neuman terms the “lost century of immigration control” that occurred alongside slavery and emancipation prior to the consolidation of the federal immigration authority.¹ These roots of detention reflect a complex history of immobilizing, isolating, and forcefully removing black, Indigenous, and, later, migrant bodies within and from the nation. The chapter is a story not of progress or decline but of the entrenchment

N2  - Background Policing, corrections, and other carceral institutions are under scrutiny for driving health harms, while receiving disproportionate resources at the expense of prevention and other services. Amidst renewed interest in structural determinants of health, roles of race and class in shaping government investment priorities are poorly understood. Methods Based on the Social Conflict Model, we assessed relationships between city racial/ economic profiles measured by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) and budgetary priorities measured by the novel Carceral Resource Index (CRI), contrasting investments in carceral systems with funding for health and social support across the 50 most populous cities in the United States (U.S.). Bivariate correlations, and unadjusted and adjusted polynomial regression models were used to assess the relationship between budgetary investments and population concentration at extremes in terms of income, racial/ethnic composition, and education, controlling for other demographic characteristics. Results In our sample, median CRI was -0.59 (IQR -0.64, -0.45), with only seven cities exhibiting positive CRI values. This indicates that most large U.S. cities spend more on carceral systems than on health and supportive services, combined. Adjusted polynomial models showed a convex relationship between the CRI and ICE-Education, and ICE-Race(White vs. Black)+Income, with quadratic terms that were positive and significant at p<0.05. After controlling for age, the strongest prioritization of carceral systems was observed in cities where the proportion of low-income Black residents approached or exceeded that of high-income white residents. Conclusions Municipal prioritization of carceral investments over health and social support is pervasive in the U.S and exacerbated by racial and economic disparities. The CRI offers new opportunities to understand the role of government investments as a structural determinant of health and safety. Longitudinal research is warranted to examine the relationship between budget priorities, structural racism, and health outcomes.

N2  - The social movement for #PoliceFreeSchools (and the adjacent campaign on college and university campuses called #PoliceFreeCampuses) welcomes an opportunity to reimagine school discipline and safety in contradistinction to current carceral forms. Scholars have moved away from notions of “school to prison pipeline” by demonstrating the many ways schools are organized as carceral spaces (e.g., school-prison nexus). A conceptual framework of Anti-carceral leadership is put forward in this paper to underscore the need for a leadership paradigm that actively refuses the logics of the carceral state (e.g., social control). The paper underscores how the logics of antiblackness may sustain mechanisms of social control in education policy intended to undo racialized harm. The tensions of be(com)ing an anti-carceral leader and its significance for undoing technologies of punishment, confinement, and constraint that reinforce schooling as a site of Black pain and suffering are discussed.

N2  - This essay examines how the biblically-based theologies deployed in faith-based prison programs are intertwined with carceral technologies and how the emotional/spiritual objectives of the increasingly theologically supported prison industrial complex are bound up with the affective structures and strategies of (racialized) interest and debt. In effect, the essay brings a range of affect theorists into conversation with critics of the prison industrial complex to tease out the interconnected affective, financial, theological, moral, and environmental components of contemporary carceral technologies. Without such analysis, it is argued, prison reform can only ever be a further occluded phase of radical neoliberalism.

N2  - Music’s sanctioned role in the day-to-day running of the ‘late-modern’ prison is to ensure wellbeing and compliance of prisoners, with most regimes facilitating access to music through the form of radios, cd’s, and cassette players. As a result, music often comes tied to judgements by the regime about prisoners’ conduct, with incentive systems allowing the regime to confiscate earned possessions under certain conditions. In this way, the role of music in prison is often continuous with the mechanisms of carceral control, with its ‘humanising’ or ‘therapeutic’ effects being defined as a luxury to be earned through good behaviour and critical engagement with one’s moral and psychological treatment. By tracing the history of music during the birth of the modern prison in the nineteenth century, this paper asks how music became incorporated into the discourse and technology of the emerging carceral state. Drawing principally on the work of Michel Foucault, this paper seeks to explore the relationship between music and ‘the self’ as it is applied to carceral subjects. Foucault shows how the expansion of the carceral state at the end of the nineteenth century relied on the production of knowledge about the subject through the application of disciplinary techniques. By exploring the construction of the self through the discourse of music at the end of the eighteenth century and in the published works of carceral reformers at the end of the nineteenth century, this paper seeks to explore the role that music played within this period of carceral expansion. The discussion will focus on the ways in which music acts as a conduit for forms of carceral power through its relationship with the self.

N2  - The over-reliance on incarceration in the USA is a racialized phenomenon which has affected millions of families – disproportionately people of colour – reconfiguring kinship around the criminal legal system. Mass incarceration, then, disrupts conventional modes of reproduction and threatens reproductive justice, separates families and funnels children into foster care, diverts funds from social services into prisons, restricts women's access to abortion and adequate pregnancy care, shackles women in childbirth, and incarcerates people during their prime reproductive years. Beyond these obvious disruptions to reproduction, incarceration also cultivates certain ways of being a parent. Much of the critical literature on mass incarceration focuses on men, largely because of fewer women and masculinist assumptions of the carceral system. This paper looks specifically at how women's reproduction is experienced and managed by carceral institutions, and how mass incarceration itself is a reproductive technology. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at a women's jail, I explore pregnancy and motherhood behind bars. Certain types of mothering are foreclosed, while an idealized version of maternal identity is simultaneously promoted. For many incarcerated women, jail is the only place where they can experience this form of motherhood, as forces of structural violence outside of jail often limit their ability to parent, such as involvement of child welfare institutions, addiction and homelessness. The myriad ways in which incarcerated women's reproduction is suppressed and enabled is a critical lens through which to understand how institutions and forces of racial oppression reinforce idealized notions of motherhood while making them categorically unattainable.

N2  - This article calls for an abolitionist turn in Science and Technology Studies (STS) in order to engage with mass incarceration and the carceral-industrial-complex. Based on my ethnographic fieldwork in New York City jails, this article sets out to (1) argue for an abolitionist STS that intervenes in the racialized logics of “criminal man”; (2) offer the carceral body as arising from this abolitionist intervention into mass incarceration; and (3) illustrate how ontological multiplicities and critical phenomenology might be deployed as abolitionist STS tools. The premise is that ending mass incarceration requires philosophical interventions that resist the current racist, capitalist framework of the carceral-industrial-complex by disrupting the very foundations of reality. Abolitionist STS arises out of feminist and critical race STS as an intervention not only into criminology, but also into social theory’s ontological turn by attending to the interplay of carceral epistemologies and ontologies. When multiplicities, experientialities, complexities, contradictions, and power dynamics are drawn out, abolition is no longer an undoing but a proliferation that disinvests and contravenes carceral logics.

Capital, a global investment firm headquartered in Miami, Florida, purchased T-Netix in 2004 for $70 million.That year H.I.G. also bought Evercom.T-Netix's main competitor, then merged the two and formed today's Securus.The dual acquisition was a "solid investment" according to H.I.G.'s Lewis Schoenwetter, and would be "an engine of growth for the future." Securus's investment web doesn't stop there.Their software engineers are also creeping into surveillance work with the launch of THREADS, an analytical tool which according to the company website, "examines billions of records to provide focused leads by detecting patterns, anomalies, linkages and correlations both inside and outside of prison walls." A particular area of specialization is detecting cell phones inside prisons and analyzing the calls made to "reveal more connections." Their most recent platform is "Connect Us" which [Richard A. Smith] claims will "provide those incarcerated with a multitude of services never seen before in corrections." ConnectUs promises to "completely manage an inmate's experience" by overseeing not only phone calls and video visits but "inmate forms grievances, videos, commissary ordering, third party website access, job applications, education programs and any number of services."

N2  - This volume considers the interconnection of racial oppression in the U.S. South and West, presenting thirteen case studies that explore the ways in which citizens and migrants alike have been caged, detained, deported, and incarcerated, and what these practices tell us about state building, converging and coercive legal powers, and national sovereignty. As these studies depict the institutional development and state scaffolding of overlapping carceral regimes, they also consider how prisoners and immigrants resisted such oppression and violence by drawing on the transnational politics of human rights and liberation, transcending the isolation of incarceration, detention, deportation and the boundaries of domestic law.

N2  - From broken-window policing in Detroit to prison-building in Appalachia, exploring the expansion of the carceral state and its oppressive social relations into everyday life
Prison Land offers a geographic excavation of the prison as a set of social relations-including property, work, gender, and race-enacted across various landscapes of American life. Prisons, Brett Story shows, are more than just buildings of incarceration bound to cycles of crime and punishment. Instead, she investigates the production of carceral power at a range of sites, from buses to coalfields and from blighted cities to urban financial hubs, to demonstrate how the organization of carceral space is ideologically and materially grounded in racial capitalism.
Story's critically acclaimed film The Prison in Twelve Landscapes is based on the same research that informs this book. In both, Story takes an expansive view of what constitutes contemporary carceral space, interrogating the ways in which racial capitalism is reproduced and for which police technologies of containment and control are employed. By framing the prison as a set of social relations, Prison Land forces us to confront the production of new carceral forms that go well beyond the prison system. In doing so, it profoundly undermines both conventional ideas of prisons as logical responses to the problem of crime and attachment to punishment as the relevant measure of a transformed criminal justice system.

N2  - This article argues that classical Hollywood prison films narrativise sound towards counter-carceral ends. Building on sound’s uniquely fluid relationship to the penitentiary’s hard spatial boundaries, it finds that prison films of the classical Hollywood era are full of inmate characters who deploy sound strategies and sound technologies to protest, oppose, or escape from carceral systems.
Structured around case studies of Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and Caged! (1950), films in which sound plays a critical narrative function, the article develops the work of film and media scholars who have emphasised film sound’s ability to draw the spectator into a phenomenological/affectual relationship with imprisoned characters. However, by shifting focus from affect and experience to narrative and resistance, this investigation also engages current developments in the study of prison sound in theoretical criminology and carceral abolitionist scholarship. This literature encourages a pursuit of how prison films may depict convicts enacting ‘counter-carceral acoustemologies’. This leads the article to posit that sound is not only an avenue for audiences to experience the acoustics of imprisonment but a narrative and political tool that can be used by prisoners (real or fictional) against imprisonment.

N2  - Black and Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by both incarceration and COVID-19. The epidemiological relationship between carceral facilities and community health during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, remains largely unexamined. Using data from Cook County Jail, we examine temporal patterns in the relationship between jail cycling (i.e., arrest and processing of individuals through jails before release) and community cases of COVID-19 in Chicago ZIP codes. We use multivariate regression analyses and a machine-learning tool, elastic regression, with 1,706 demographic control variables. We find that for each arrested individual cycled through Cook County Jail in March 2020, five additional cases of COVID-19 in their ZIP code of residence are independently attributable to the jail as of August. A total 86% of this additional disease burden is borne by majority-Black and/or -Hispanic ZIPs, accounting for 17% of cumulative COVID-19 cases in these ZIPs, 6% in majority-White ZIPs, and 13% across all ZIPs. Jail cycling in March alone can independently account for 21% of racial COVID-19 disparities in Chicago as of August 2020. Relative to all demographic variables in our analysis, jail cycling is the strongest predictor of COVID-19 rates, considerably exceeding poverty, race, and population density, for example. Arrest and incarceration policies appear to be increasing COVID-19 incidence in communities. Our data suggest that jails function as infectious disease multipliers and epidemiological pumps that are especially affecting marginalized communities. Given disproportionate policing and incarceration of racialized residents nationally, the criminal punishment system may explain a large proportion of racial COVID-19 disparities noted across the United States.

N2  - This article discusses findings from an ethnographic study of a bail and remand court in Victoria, Australia. Through a focus on the sensory dimensions of forced movements within and through the bail court, the article contributes to the burgeoning sub-field of sensory criminology and develops the concept of ‘carceral churn’. The article argues that the bail court’s churn reproduces criminal and carceral subjects and is implicated in a project of carceral buildup. The churn of the bail court involves forms of mobility and exchange via the inter- and intra-carceral spaces that variously dull, distort, deprive or assault the senses with oppressive effects. This includes both ‘new’ and ‘old’ penal technologies such as holding cells, the custody dock, AV links and court-prison transport. The analysis of sensory violence challenges the notion that court ‘efficiency’ can improve justice experiences and outcomes and instead calls for increased attention to the harms and lethality that flow from carceral churn left un-checked.

N2  - Objective
To assess whether knowledge of Tuskegee, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency's detainment of children, and satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation were associated with trust in actors involved in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines.
Data Sources and Study Setting
National survey with a convenience sample of Black (n = 1019) and Hispanic (n = 994) adults between July 1 and 26, 2021.
Study Design
Observational study using stratified adjusted logistic regression models to measure the association between ratings of the trustworthiness of actors involved in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines.
Principal Findings
Among Black respondents, lower satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of pharmaceutical companies (ME: −0.09; CI: −0.15, 0.02), the FDA (ME: −0.07; CI: −0.14, −0.00), the Trump Administration (ME: −0.09; CI: −0.16, −0.02), the Biden Administration (ME: −0.07, CI: −0.10, 0.04), and elected officials (ME: −0.10, CI: −0.18, −0.03). Among Hispanic respondents, lower satisfaction was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of the Trump Administration (ME: −0.14, CI: −0.22, −0.06) and elected officials (ME: −0.11; CI: −0.19, −0.02). Greater knowledge of ICE's detainment of children and families among Hispanic respondents was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of state elected officials (ME: −0.09, CI: −0.16, 0.01). Greater knowledge of the US Public Health Service Study of Syphilis in Tuskegee was associated with higher trustworthiness ratings of their usual source of care (ME: 0.09; CI: 0.28, 0.15) among Black respondents (ME: 0.09; CI: 0.01, 0.16).
Conclusions
Among Black respondents, lower satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation was associated with lowered levels of trust in pharmaceutical companies, some government officials, and administrators; it was not associated with the erosion of trust in direct sources of health care delivery, information, or regulation. Among Hispanic respondents, greater knowledge of the ICE detainments was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of elected state officials. Paradoxically, higher knowledge of the Study of Syphilis in Tuskegee was associated with higher trustworthiness ratings in usual sources of care.

N2  - This article reviews key works in the anthropology of mass incarceration, generated by anthropologists and their interlocutors whose research is directed outside physical sites of imprisonment. My geographical focus is on the United States during the last decade's political and economic Zeitgeist, shaped by the manifestations and consequences of the carceral state and the prison industrial complex. My discussion is also guided by research invigorated by anthropology's decolonizing drive and growing concern about racism within and outside the academy. Along the way, and emphasized in the final section, I make the case that anthropology's abiding interest in kinship is a productive approach for configuring our understanding of the American carceral state and the racial landscapes of carcerality. The research reviewed shows how deeply carcerality is embedded in race, illuminating its destructiveness in Black and brown communities, yet also revealing the creation of regenerative spaces of kinship.

N2  - In virtually all areas of law, the home is the ultimate constitutionally protected area, at least in theory. In practice, a range of modern institutions that target private life-from public housing to child welfare-have turned the home into a routinely surveilled space. Indeed, for the 4.5 million people on criminal court supervision, their home is their prison, or what I call a "carceral home." Often in the name of decarceration, prison walls are replaced with restrictive rules that govern every aspect of private life and invasive surveillance technology that continuously records intimate information. While prisons have always been treated in the law as sites of punishment and diminished privacy, homes have not. Yet in the carceral home people have little privacy in the place where they presumptively should have the most. If progressive state interventions are to continue, some amount of home surveillance is surely inevitable. But these trends raise a critical, underexplored question: When the home is carceral, what is, or should be, left of the home as a protected area? This Article addresses that question. Descriptively, it draws on a fifty-state analysis of court supervision rules to reveal the extent of targeted invasions of intimate life in the name of rehabilitation or an alternative to prison, rendering the home a highly surveilled space. Normatively, it argues that allowing this state of affairs with no corresponding adaptations in legal doctrine is untenable.

N2  - Since 2002, prisoners at Guantánamo Bay detention camp have been force-fed as punishment for hunger striking, prompting the question of at what point the medical clinic becomes a site of punitive suffering. This essay examines force-feeding as an instantiation of the tension between authority, visuality, and pain. Through a detailed analysis of prisoner testimonials, the policy manual
, and a video project by human rights organization Reprieve featuring artist Yasiin Bey simulating the “proper” techniques for force-feeding, the author argues that pain becomes the basis of not only political subjectivity but also relationality between those held captive and the spectator.

N2  - Critical social science research on conservation practice has long articulated the tactics that emerge out of a history of carcerality, environmental racism, colonialism, and violence against oppressed peoples. Despite these critiques, there has been little change in how conservation is conceptualised and implemented, resulting in the continuation of violence, racism, and injustice. Abolition ecologies offer a framework to see the world through a carceral lens and imagine an abolitionist future for conservation. Using Kenya as a case study, we outline the three ways that carcerality is apparent in and integral to contemporary conservation practices: legal/juridical, technoscience, and privatisation. Illuminating the carcerality of conservation practices, we posit, allows scholars and practitioners to begin to imagine and work towards a more just and liberatory conservation movement, one that minimises the perpetuation and reproduction of white supremacy, violence, and environmental injustice.

N2  - Involuntary commitment links the healthcare, public health, and legislative systems to act as a “carceral health-service.” While masquerading as more humane and medicalized, such coercive modalities nevertheless further reinforce the systems, structures, practices, and policies of structural oppression and white supremacy. We argue that due to involuntary commitment’s inextricable connection to the carceral system, and a longer history of violent social control, this legal framework cannot and must not be held out as a viable alternative to the criminal legal system responses to behavioral and mental health challenges. Instead, this article proposes true alternatives to incarceration that are centered on liberation that seeks to shrink the carceral system’s grasp on individuals’ and communities’ lives. In this, we draw inspiration from street-level praxis and action theory emanating from grassroots organizations and community organizers across the country under a Public Health Abolition framework.

N2  - This paper asks how the logics of globalized supply chains—particularly through fixes, risk, speed and stoppages, and motility—are articulated in carceral space. We employ critical logistics in conversation with carceral geographies and critical mobilities to examine prison transfers, the routine movement of incarcerated people between carceral sites, as a logistical system designed to fix carceral crises; which is to say, to make prisons viable. This work emerges from preliminary research on prison transfers, conducted from 2018 to 2019, including interviews with advocates and formerly incarcerated people and analysis of data and administrative documents obtained from the New York Department of Corrections, among others. First, we locate the emergence of contemporary practices of logistical transfer management (“transfer logistics”) in the prison boom of the 1980s–1990s. We then examine the present-day transfer system to consider how risk calculation and carceral fixes inform movement throughout prison constellations as well as how transfers disrupt the fragile worlding that happens in prisons. Finally, we turn to how these logics are being reshaped and reiterated in the era of neoliberal urban planning through “justice hubs.”

N2  - Religious conversion and marriage across communal lines have long been contentious in India. The contemporary debate on ‘Love Jihad’ – the Hindu Nationalist conspiracy theory that accuses Muslim men of waging a religious war by seducing and converting unsuspecting Hindu brides – exemplifies the simultaneously geopolitical and biopolitical anxiety that religious conversion inspires. In this paper, I focus on the case of Hadiya, a young woman from Kerala, who, in 2016, found herself remanded first to her university’s hostel – as dormitories are called in India – and then to her parents’ home as various courts debated on the authenticity of her conversion to Islam, and her marriage to a Muslim partner. Through an examination of media discourse and court records in this case, the paper argues that in ‘Love Jihad’, the domestic and the carceral are rendered inextricably intertwined through an affective politics that presents desire outside the bounds of caste and religion as geopolitically misoriented. Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s work on the phenomenology of orientation, I focus on the intimate geographies of the hostel, which I argue exemplifies a site of carceral convergence between nation and family, in the management of the affective disorder associated with religious conversion.

N2  - COVID-19 has been an unprecedented challenge in carceral facilities. As COVID-19 outbreaks spread in the US in early 2020, many jails, prisons, juvenile detention centers, and other carceral facilities undertook infection control measures such as increased quarantine and reduced outside visitation. However, the implementation of these decisions varied widely across facilities and jurisdictions. We explored how carceral decision makers grappled with ethically fraught public health challenges during the pandemic. We conducted semistructured interviews during May-October 2021 with thirty-two medical and security leaders from a diverse array of US jails and prisons. Although some facilities had existing detailed outbreak plans, most plans were inadequate for a rapidly evolving pandemic such as COVID-19. Frequently, this caused facilities to enact improvised containment plans. Quarantine and isolation were rapidly adopted across facilities in response to COVID-19, but in an inconsistent manner. Decision makers generally approached quarantine and isolation protocols as a logistical challenge, rather than an ethical one. Although they recognized the hardships imposed on incarcerated people, they generally saw the measures as justified. Comprehensive outbreak control guidelines for pandemic diseases in carceral facilities are urgently needed to ensure that future responses are more equitable and effective.

N2  - This article deals with the ways in which populations in prison-neighbourhood circuits are policed, managed, and contained in Santiago, Chile. It draws attention to how the safeguarding of social order and security policy is intertwined with the reproduction of carceral domesticities among low-income households. Building on ethnographic research conducted in two stages between 2017 and 2022 with practitioners of crime prevention programmes and the ‘problem’ families targeted by such initiatives, the article addresses carceral domesticity as containment of troubled families. It shows how such containment involves a project of subjectivation centred on women to enforce a gendered family model by engaging state programmes, psychosocial manuals, and prevention practitioners. It focuses on security and enclosure mechanisms in domestic spaces at work through a grammar of care and prevention. By examining the pitfalls that carceral domesticity encounters in everyday domestic life, the article sheds light on the productivity of resistances to enable spaces of autonomy in times of economic crisis and social uprising in Chile.

N2  - It is widely acknowledged that Singapore’s labour-migration regime is unequal and bifurcated, with migrants that are categorised as foreign professionals afforded many more rights than those categorised as migrant workers. While migrant construction, process, and shipyard workers are expected to reside in dormitories or other shared accommodation, migrant domestic workers are mandated to live in their employers’ homes, where their gendered bodies are confined and disciplined. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, in this article I demonstrate that Singapore’s labour-migration regime is underpinned with a carceral logic that imposes bodily controls on domestic workers through policy, legal regulations, and practices which, I argue, constitute gendered disciplinary apparatuses. Moreover, by examining migrant domestic workers’ everyday experiences, I suggest that different dwelling spaces – namely, employers’ homes and shelters – can be conceptualised as carceral domesticities. Utilised by the state as carceral infrastructure, I show the ways in which these dwelling spaces become geographies of detainment and punishment, in/through which different actors become involved in disciplining intimacy, morality, and maintaining socio-racial order in the nation. Simultaneously, the carceral nature of the labour-migration regime produces forms of domesticity which relies on the containment of migrant workers.

N2  - Despite increased attention to the links between the criminal justice system and health, how criminal justice contacts shape health and contribute to racial health disparities remains to be better understood. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 5,488) and several analytic techniques—including a quasi-treatment–control design, treatment-weighting procedures, and mediation analyses—this study examines how criminal justice contacts shape inflammatory and depressive risk and contribute to black–white health gaps. Findings revealed that incarceration is associated with increased C-reactive protein and depressive risk, particularly for individuals who experienced long durations of incarceration. Arrests are also associated with mental health, and mediation analyses showed that racial disparities in arrests and incarceration were drivers of black–white gaps in depressive symptoms. Together, this study provides new evidence of the role of the criminal justice system in shaping health and patterning black–white health gaps from adolescence through early adulthood.

N2  - No other industrialized democracy has a carceral system that is as expansive, punitive, and racialized as that of the United States. More than 2.2 million people in 2018 were incarcerated in jails and prisons, a six-fold increase since the 1970s. Each year more than 600 000 people are released from prisons and more than 11 million cycle through jails, extending the effects of incarceration into households and shaping community health.Mass incarceration is the result of social, political, and economic forces with deep roots in the aftermaths of slavery, labor exploitation, and racial discrimination. This is evident in the stark racial inequalities that exist in the carceral system. Black people are more likely to be arrested, killed by police, incarcerated, and placed in solitary confinement than their White counterparts. The criminalization of blackness and poverty, as reflected in the failed war on drugs, draconian sentencing laws, centralized power ofprosecutors, a school-to-prison pipeline, and gutting of health and social systems, is among the forces underlying the titanic expansion and deep entrenchment of the carceral state. Over the past 40 years, our society has deliberately divested from social and public goods designed to promote health and economic security while pumping resources into police, courts, and correctional systems that punish, impoverish, and dehumanize people and communities.

N2  - Young men are overrepresented among people detained in police custody in Victoria, Australia, a closed institution that has mostly escaped public scrutiny. Our study sheds light on this underexamined place from the perspective of 28 marginalized young men (aged 19–24) detained there prior to adult prison. Drawing on Bacchi’s “What’s the problem represented to be?” approach and the subdiscipline of carceral geography, we disrupt the assumed purpose of police custody as a place to simply detain people while awaiting court and/or transfer to prison. We illustrate how police custody, although ostensibly for ensuring the safety and protection of the community, privileges that of some over others, with detrimental effects for marginalized groups. We highlight how harsh, degrading, hostile environments intersected with lived experiences and exacerbated psychological, social, and physical health harms; made possible young men’s constitution as dirty, violent, and subhuman; and worked to legitimize breaches of human rights.

N2  - Policing and incarceration are feminist issues that stand to be interrogated through examinations of carceral practices. This essay positions the management and withholding of information and the observation of communications as instances of carceral specific practices that shape possibilities for incarcerated people and their communities. The author draws from their experience as a librarian in carceral facilities to outline how State-enacted violence occurs through the regulation and management of information access. As carceral facilities utilize third-party ICT providers, it is difficult to ascertain what information is or is not available. The introduction of new and evolving ICTs has led to increased opportunities for the State to monitor people who are incarcerated and their communities, positioning incarcerated people and their networks not only as sources of information but as data to train technologies of policing and surveillance. Instances of resistance to these practices reveal some ways that people who are not incarcerated can act in solidarity with people who are incarcerated and people who are subject to State surveillance.

N2  - In a research letter in this issue, Rempel et al. compared community water systems that serve the Kern Valley State Prison (KVSP) and three comparable rural communities in California that rely solely on groundwater sources. They found that for each of the four systems, arsenic concentrations in drinking water periodically exceeded the legal limit in violation of Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. The communities neighboring the prison benefited from local and federal remediation efforts. Yet, for people who were incarcerated, interventions such as free bottled water were often restricted. Black and Latinx people are arrested by law enforcement and incarcerated more often and for longer periods of time than their White counterparts. An important consideration is that this difference in arrest frequency and incarceration periods does not reflect disproportionate illegal activity; rather, communities of color are patrolled and punished more stringently.

N2  - We aimed to describe conditions of confinement among people incarcerated in the United States during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using a community-science data collection approach.
We developed a web-based survey with community partners to collect information on confinement conditions (COVID-19 safety, basic needs, support). Formerly incarcerated adults released after March 1, 2020, or nonincarcerated adults in communication with an incarcerated person (proxy) were recruited through social media from July 25, 2020 to March 27, 2021. Descriptive statistics were estimated in aggregate and separately by proxy or formerly incarcerated status. Responses between proxy and formerly incarcerated respondents were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests based on α=0.05.
Of 378 responses, 94% were by proxy, and 76% reflected state prison conditions. Participants reported inability to physically distance (≥6 ft at all times; 92%), inadequate access to soap (89%), water (46%), toilet paper (49%), and showers (68%) for incarcerated people. Among those receiving prepandemic mental health care, 75% reported reduced care for incarcerated people. Responses were consistent between formerly incarcerated and proxy respondents, although responses by formerly incarcerated people were limited.
Our findings suggest that a web-based community-science data collection approach through nonincarcerated community members is feasible; however, recruitment of recently released individuals may require additional resources. Our data obtained primarily through individuals in communication with an incarcerated person suggest COVID-19 safety and basic needs were not sufficiently addressed within some carceral settings in 2020-2021. The perspectives of incarcerated individuals should be leveraged in assessing crisis-response strategies.

N2  - Although youth–adult partnerships (Y‐APs) have been linked to a wide range of positive youth and community outcomes, the possibility of Y‐AP occurrence in spaces of racialized social control such as youth residential facilities remains unknown. Rooted in a social justice and rights‐based ethos, Y‐APs represent an innovative conceptual and practice model of youth engagement that challenges longstanding patterns of control that characterize adult‐youth relationships in these settings. This study uses narrative thematic inquiry and counter storytelling to examine frontline youth care workers' narratives (N = 21) of Y‐AP enactment against the backdrop of anti‐Black racism in youth residential facilities. Workers' narratives include instances of both enhanced and diminished forms of partnership, and explanations for Y‐AP diminishment depict an interplay of racist (anti‐Black) ideologies and organizational processes, including selective racial cognizance in hiring practices, color‐evasive and elitist training, and racialized blame‐shifting. Importantly, workers' narratives suggest that although flourishing Y‐APs remain elusive, it is not a foregone conclusion that Y‐APs cannot occur to realize youth development and social change in these extreme contexts.
Highlights
Depicts how anti‐Blackness impedes workers' enactment of youth–adult partnerships (Y‐APs).
Explains how anti‐Blackness manifests organizationally to diminish partnership potential.
Theorizes workers' Y‐AP challenges and imagined alternatives from a BlackCrit standpoint.
Emphasizes social justice youth development as imperative to achieve systems change.

N2  - Incarcerated persons are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) at rates approximate to 10 times higher than that of the general population in the United States. To achieve national hepatitis C elimination goals, the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C in incarcerated persons must be prioritized. In 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all persons receive opt -out HCV screening upon entry into a carceral setting. We review recommendations, treatments, and policy strategies used to promote HCV opt -out universal HCV screening and treatment in incarcerated populations in the United States. Treatment of hepatitis C in carceral settings has increased but varies by jurisdiction and is not sufficient to achieve HCV elimination. Strengthening universal HCV screening and treatment of HCV-infected incarcerated persons is necessary for HCV elimination nationwide.

N2  - Jaguars carry deep cultural and spiritual significance throughout the Americas, from sports mascots to their associations with Indigenous deities to their veneration as a vulnerable and charismatic megafauna. Though thought to be extinct in the US for much of the twentieth century, they maintain a small but powerful presence along the US/México border region. The continued viability of these jaguar populations is severely threatened by the border walls that the US government has been working to erect since the early 2000s. By examining the entanglements between jaguar and border geographies on the one hand, and racially disposable migrants, Indigenous peoples, and racial capitalism on the other, this article argues that carceral configurations of nation-state borders, conservation, and immigration enforcement are incompatible with liberatory notions of human and nonhuman survival. It poses border abolition that takes seriously the nonhuman, vis-à-vis jaguars, is essential to making abolition geographies and ecologies within and beyond the US/México borderlands.

N2  - Objectives. To assess the US incarcerated population 's risk of exposure to per- and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). Methods. We assessed how many of the 6118 US carceral facilities were located in the same hydrologic unit code watershed boundaries as known or likely locations of PFAS contamination. We conducted geospatial analyses on data aggregated from Environmental Protection Agency databases and a PFAS site tracker in 2022 to model the hydrologically feasible known and presumptive PFAS contamination sites for nearly 2 million incarcerated people. Results. Findings indicate that 5% (-310) of US carceral facilities have at least 1 known source of PFAS contamination in the same watershed boundary and that it is at a higher elevation than the facility; also 47% (-2285) have at least 1 presumptive source. A minimum of 990 000 people are incarcerated in these facilities, including at least 12 800 juveniles. Exposure risks faced by incarcerated youths are disproportionately underassessed. Conclusions. The long-term impacts from potential exposures to PFAS are preventable and exacerbate health inequities among incarcerated populations. Widespread public attention to PFASs can be parlayed into broader environmental monitoring for imprisoned people.

N2  - Background
Medicaid expansion via the Affordable Care Act, more recent legislation and Medicaid 1115 waivers offer opportunity to increase health care access among individuals involved in the carceral system. Effective enrollment of new beneficiaries and temporary suspension and reactivation of existing Medicaid benefits upon release is key to the success of these efforts. This study aims to characterize how jails, prisons and Medicaid agencies are implementing Medicaid suspension and enrollment programs and identifies barriers and facilitators to implementation.
Methods
We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews with 36 multi-state leaders in carceral facilities, Medicaid agencies, local health departments and national policy experts from 2020 to 2021. Interviews covered 4 domains: (1) the role of policy in influencing carceral and reentry Medicaid practices, (2) implementation strategies to suspend and enroll incarcerated individuals into Medicaid, (3) barriers and facilitators to successful implementation, and (4) variation in implementation between jails and prisons.
Results
Participants identified logistical challenges with suspension and enrollment, including limited infrastructure for data sharing between carceral facilities and Medicaid agencies, burdensome bureaucratic requirements, and challenges with Medicaid renewal, particularly in the jail environment. They offered opportunities to overcome barriers, such as the creation of specialized incarcerated Medicaid benefit categories and provision of in-reach services via managed care organizations. Participants also called for improvements to Medicaid reactivation processes, as even when facilities successfully suspended benefits, individuals faced significant challenges and delays reactivating benefits upon release. Participants also called for further loosening of the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy.
Discussion
Findings highlight the need to update data sharing infrastructure, which will be critical to the implementation of the 1115 waivers, as carceral facilities will be subject to Medicaid billing and reporting requirements. In addition to investing in the ability to newly enroll and suspend Medicaid benefits, attention towards improving timely reactivation practices is needed, particularly given the highly elevated risk of mortality immediately after release. Participants calls for further reforms to the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy are consistent with proposed legislation.
Conclusions
Findings can critically inform the successful implementation of Medicaid-based reforms to improve the health of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people.

N2  - Residents of carceral facilities are exposed to poor ventilation conditions which leads to the spread of communicable diseases such as COVID-19. Indoor ventilation conditions are rarely studied within carceral settings and there remains limited capacity to develop solutions to address the impact of poor ventilation on the health of people who are incarcerated. In this study, we empirically measured ventilation rates within housing units of six adult prisons in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and compare the measured ventilation rates to recommended standards issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Findings from the empirical assessment include lower ventilation rates than the recommended ventilation standards with particularly low ventilation during winter months when heating systems were in use. Inadvertent airflows from spaces housing potentially infected individuals to shared common spaces was also observed. The methodology used for this work can be leveraged for routine ventilation monitoring, pandemic preparedness, and disaster response.

N2  - A major new reading of a U.S. public health system
shaped by fraught perceptions of culture, race, and
criminality
At the heart of Archiving Medical Violence is an
interrogation of the notions of national and scientific progress,
marking an advance in scholarship that shows how such violence is
both an engine of medical progress and, more broadly, the
production of empire. It reads the medical archive through a lens
that centers how it is produced, remembered, and contested within
cultural production and critical memory.
In this innovative and interdisciplinary book, Christopher
Perreira argues that it is in the contradictions of settler
colonialism and racial capitalism that we find how medical violence
is narrated as a public good. He presents case studies from across
a range of locations-Hawai'i, California, Louisiana, Guatemala-and
historical periods from the nineteenth century on. Examining
national and scientific conceptions of progress through the lens of
medicine and public health, he places official archives in dialogue
with visual and literary works, patient writing, and more.
Archiving Medical Violence explores the contested
public terrains for narrating value and vulnerabilities, bodies and
geographical locations. Ultimately, Perreira reveals for us a
medical imaginary built on racialized criminality driving
contemporary politics of citizenship, memory, and identity.

N2  - This article addresses the recent legal and property changes, and their socio-spatial consequences in Christiania, Copenhagen. During recent years the community that has always been against private ownership has lost its special legal status, and has become a property owner of a vast area in the middle of Copenhagen. We analyse the situation in relation to Christiania’s current housing condition, individual residents’ privatisation efforts, and decades-long normalisation efforts by the state. We argue that the processes of normalisation, legalisation, criminalisation and privatisation are expressions of the carceral in more-than-institutional context, and that questions of property are strongly involved in these carceral practices in Christiania. Not only in the relations between Christiania and the state, but also in socio-spatial relations inside of the community, defining who is included or excluded, or how people behave towards each other. Moreover, a part of the community is cultivating a carceral culture towards those in favour of privatisation, using the rights of the property owner and the community’s ideologies as justifications.

N2  - This dissertation explores the cultural roots of the imprisonment of women in modern America. Though women prisoners represent the fastest growing sector of the American prison population today, increasing at triple the rate of male prisoners, scholars offer limited historical context for this dramatic growth. This project focuses on the transitional carceral era, a set of decades that followed the women’s reformatory era and preceded the current epidemic of mass incarceration. It analyzes common sense understandings of American female prisoners, prisons, and carceral technologies depicted in news media, novels, and popular film, paying particular attention to the ways in which cultural products shaped and where shaped by constructions of whiteness and femininity. Using this lens, Lessons in Captivity makes two primary arguments and interventions. First, I argue that cultural representations of women prisoners were—and continue to be—indispensable tools through which the American public came to understand, learn about, and acclimate to carceral practices, such as solitary confinement and the death penalty. Mainstream newspapers and women-in-prison films thus helped to normalize the punitive turn in America, providing an imaginary space through which citizens defined, negotiated, and altered their perceptions of women prisoners. Second, in addition to an educational function, cultural representations of women in prison instructed the state about what worked, failed, and provoked popular resistance. In this way, cultural representations of carceral practices provided a feedback loop through which the state could alter its tactics to decrease political friction, thereby creating more “efficient” carceral strategies and technologies. This feedback often differed for white prisoners and prisoners of color, thus providing additional ways to the state to maintain gender and racial hierarchies.

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Black and other racially minoritized groups are overrepresented among those who experience firearm homicide. There has been a stark increase in incarcerated populations in the US since the 1980s, largely due to differential drug sentencing, of which racially minoritized individuals are also overrepresented; social disorganization theory postulates that community and family instability resulting from incarceration can further worsen crime. OBJECTIVE: To understand the association of race-specific incarceration with race-specific firearm violence rates in Chicago, Illinois, through the lens of social vulnerability and family instability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study with a retrospective cohort design utilized homicide data for the city of Chicago from January 1, 2001, to August 31, 2019. Demographic data at the census block level was obtained from the 2010 decennial census. Incarceration rates were obtained by race and ethnicity at the census tract level from the Opportunity Atlas. Data analysis occurred from January to June 2023. EXPOSURE: Race-specific incarceration rates were the primary exposures of interest. The Social Vulnerability Index and single-parent households were studied as mediators. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Race-specific firearm homicide rates were the outcomes of interest. Structural equation modeling was used to understand the mediating effect of social vulnerability and single-parent households on the association of incarceration with firearm homicides. RESULTS: A total of 46 312 census blocks were evaluated. Black-specific incarceration rates were found to be associated with Black-specific firearm homicides (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.94), but there was no association for Hispanic incarceration rates (IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.75-1.28) or White incarceration rates (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.39-1.16). In the association of Black incarceration rates with Black firearm homicide rates, social vulnerability did not mediate the interaction, but the percentage of single-parent households mediated 23% of the interaction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that higher rates of incarceration were associated with increased rates of firearm homicides among Black communities alone; this association was found to be mediated partially through the density of single-parent households in these areas, suggesting that social disorganization resulting from mass incarceration may perpetuate firearm homicides. Targeted policies addressing mass incarceration and the disparities therein may be a means of reducing urban firearm homicides.

N2  - BackgroundImplementing public health interventions can be challenging in carceral settings. Jails are institutions with the shortest lengths of stay, resulting in frequent turnover and constantly shifting populations. Jails had particularly acute challenges during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when incarcerated persons were highly susceptible to infection and severe disease. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and facilitators to wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) and nasal self-testing (NST) as a combined strategy of COVID-19 surveillance in Fulton County Jail (FCJ), Atlanta, Georgia. Implications for efficient and effective infectious disease testing among this susceptible population are relevant for ongoing surveillance of current endemic pathogens and future epidemics.MethodsWe utilized a multilevel, theory-informed qualitative approach to conduct semi-structured one-on-one and small group interviews with nine distinct jail stakeholder groups: jail custody leadership, administrators, officers, maintenance workers, Georgia Department of Health's COVID-19 testing contractor, jail health care leaders, nursing staff, laboratory leadership, and staff. Interview guides and analyses were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). We used Applied Thematic Analysis to identify domains within CFIR reflecting barriers and facilitators to WBS combined with NST in large urban jail settings.ResultsTwelve interviews were conducted with administrative, healthcare, maintenance, custody, and laboratory personnel from July 2022 to November 2022. Seven CFIR constructs were identified as barriers, sixteen as facilitators, and one as a neutral factor for the implementation of WBS combined with NST. Jail stakeholders underscored the relative advantage of self-testing, highlighted limited resources, and expressed concerns for the sustainability of WBS due to competing priorities. Many of the stakeholders within the jail setting that were interviewed had hierarchical organizational structures, which made decision-making processes regarding WBS and NST complex and challenging to implement.ConclusionsGiven the political, structural, and organizational factors in a jail setting, innovations such as NST and WBS require a rigorous implementation strategy supported by ongoing engagement and collaboration with a multitude of stakeholders.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heightened toll on people incarcerated in prisons in the United States, with those incarcerated experiencing a higher rate of infection and mortality than the US population more generally. What is less well known is the degree to which COVID-19 outcomes differ among incarcerated populations, especially by race and ethnicity, where significant differences have been found among the US population as a whole. This knowledge gap is, in part, due to a lack of reporting of COVID-19 outcomes by race and ethnicity by most state prison systems. To shed light on this topic, we analyzed mortality patterns of the population incarcerated in Texas state prison facilities during both the year before (beginning April 1, 2019) and the first year of (beginning April 1, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a unique data set of roster information from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and medical examiner records. COVID-19 mortality was 1.61 and 2.12 times higher for Black and Hispanic populations, respectively, when compared with the White population in Texas prisons. Strategies for COVID-19 mitigation in carceral settings, such as vaccination and decarceration, should include an equity component to minimize disparities.

N2  - In this article, I describe the dilemmas of working as a physician-ethnographer within the Rikers Island jail healthcare system before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in April 2020. The Rikers Island jail system in New York City has been in the national spotlight as a space of violence, trauma, and death amidst calls to decarcerate by community members and abolition advocates. This article is a personal reflection on the labor and subjectivity of healthcare providers and their positionality to multiple axes of structural and interpersonal violence while attempting to provide care in carceral institutions. I observe how COVID-19 functioned as an additional form of structural violence for incarcerated people. Clinical ethnography remains an essential tool for understanding complex social phenomena such as violence. However, physician-ethnographers working in these spaces of structural violence can have unique and conflicting constraints: tasked with providing evidence-based medicine but also simultaneously participating in an unusual form of labor that is an amalgamation of care, social suffering, and punishment. Despite and across at-times conflicting roles and obligations, I propose that these fragmented subjectivities can foment social criticism, propel advocacy toward decarceration, and produce a critically engaged dialogue between fields of anthropology and medicine toward a goal of health justice.

N2  - This article introduces the concept of carceral communication to focus attention on the role of communication in mass incarceration’s racialized, criminal justice process. To argue that a communication perspective helps explain how individuals, neighborhoods, and prisons are linked together, the article uses publicly available indictments that charged three New York City youth gangs with violent crimes. It identifies three facets of carceral communication to demonstrate how and why mass incarceration is a communicative phenomenon. First, computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become the most sought-after type of criminal evidence because of its visibility and permanence. Second, law enforcement uses the interpersonal communication and neighborhood networks of incarcerated Black men for crime control and surveillance purposes. Third, carceral communication operates as a communication feedback process, in which marginalized, young, Black men under surveillance know they are being watched and respond to that surveillance with resistance that is also subject to criminalization.

N2  - Individuals released from carceral facilities have high rates of hospitalization and death, especially in the weeks immediately after their return to community settings. During this transitional process, individuals leaving incarceration are expected to engage with multiple providers working in separate, complex systems, including health care clinics, social service agencies, community-based organizations, and probation and parole services. This navigation is often complicated by individuals' physical and mental health, literacy and fluency, and socioeconomic status. Personal health information technology, which can help people access and organize their health information, could improve the transition from carceral systems to the community and mitigate health risks upon release. Yet, personal health information technologies have not been designed to meet the needs and preferences of this population nor tested for acceptability or use.
The objective of our study is to develop a mobile app to create personal health libraries for individuals returning from incarceration to help bridge the transition from carceral settings to community living.
Participants were recruited through Transitions Clinic Network clinic encounters and professional networking with justice-involved organizations. We used qualitative research methods to assess the facilitators and barriers to developing and using personal health information technology for individuals returning from incarceration. We conducted individual interviews with people just released from carceral facilities (n=~20) and providers (n=~10) from the local community and carceral facilities involved with the transition for returning community members. We used rigorous rapid qualitative analysis to generate thematic output characterizing the unique circumstances impacting the development and use of personal health information technology for individuals returning from incarceration and to identify content and features for the mobile app based on the preferences and needs of our participants.
As of February 2023, we have completed 27 qualitative interviews with individuals recently released from carceral systems (n=20) and stakeholders (n=7) who support justice-involved individuals from various organizations in the community.
We anticipate that the study will characterize the experiences of people transitioning from prison and jails to community settings; describe the information, technology resources, and needs upon reentry to the community; and create potential pathways for fostering engagement with personal health information technology.

N2  - This article examines the upheaval associated with the extension of carceral immigration enforcement into a particular rural county in Washington State. Migrant workers in shellfish, cranberry, and tourism industries began to leave the county, either through the forced mobility of deportation or quasi-voluntarily, to rejoin deported family or to avoid deportation. This process simultaneously constrained the agency of undocumented workers and presented employers with a destabilized race and labor regime that they represented as a labor shortage. In this situation, the local race and labor regime was destabilized, to the detriment of local capitals. This article extends the understanding of the regulation of labor via carceral immigration enforcement, arguing for an understanding of the place-specific and conjunctural nature of the articulation of immigration control and labor regimes. Such an approach reveals how immigration enforcement's many functions, including the sovereignty-producing and political capital-producing functions, can work in contradiction with the labor regulating, social control functions.

N2  - Between 2006 and 2022, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) attempted to address the fiscal and infrastructural crises in public housing through a number of controversial privatisation strategies. This contested push occurred alongside the pervasive role of policing in public housing. The New York City Police Department utilises several policing strategies specific to NYCHA communities, collaborating with the housing authority in the management of public housing residents. This article draws on qualitative content analysis of local policing strategies and public housing policy reforms in New York City to investigate how the state facilitates the displacement of disproportionately poor, non-white, public housing tenants while simultaneously sponsoring privatised redevelopment in their communities in ways that mirror gentrification processes usually studied in private housing. I focus on the content of and linkages between public housing-specific policing strategies and privatising public housing redevelopment plans. By examining police as collaborators within public housing policy, I uncover the entanglement of law enforcement in urban development, as well as the underlying roles and relationships between the state, capital and police in contemporary urban development and gentrification. The findings illuminate the processes of carceral urbanism, where the logics of the carceral state emerge as priorities throughout the urban governance of the contemporary neoliberal state in general, and public housing policy reform in particular.

N2  - This article explores a relatively rare archival account of female subjectivity, experience, mobility, and voice within a carceral institution in late-colonial Delhi. The capital’s “Rescue Home” was created to house women and girls removed from the city’s brothels under new legislation. While no brothels were closed in the first year of the laws functioning, the home accepted 18 women and girls and detailed their circumstances and experiences in its 1940 report. It was able to forcibly detain girls and was run upon disciplinary and racial lines, like other colonial institutions. But its inhabitants were not subject to detailed surveillance. Rather, their lives were ones usually beyond recording or whose stories were actively silenced. The 1940 Rescue Home report provides us with rich details of the commonplace, quotidian struggles which women and girls faced in colonial Delhi. The 18 case geographies of the Home’s inhabitants help us understand how sexuality and motherhood, education and character, and race all shaped routes into the home and destinations when people left. The accounts tell us of a carceral governmentality with influence beyond the disciplinary institution’s walls, but also of female subjects who resisted, spoke back, and absconded. This relationship between forced immobility and willed mobility suggests that brothels and rescue homes were not just connected, through the intended transfer of inhabitants, but can be directly compared as carceral domesticities.

N2  - Technofixes that promise to improve racism in the prison industrial complex (PIC) frequently perpetuate it instead. This article argues that carceral technofixes undermine their promises when they attempt to solve social problems by pacifying the people that these problems affect. It offers a reading of physicist Alvin Weinberg's writings on technofixes, which, he believed, could improve social problems better than people because they appeared objective. This appearance emerged through the process of scientific reduction, which simplifies social complexity to help designers identify symptoms of problems amenable to technological intervention. This article claims that scientific reduction orients technofixes to make systemic power in the PIC invisible and to silence radical calls for system reform. I explore these tendencies through two examples: (1) Weinberg's hypothesis that air conditioning could prevent Black uprisings in the 1960s and (2) the COMPAS recidivism algorithm at use in Florida today, which attempts to pacify critics of the PIC by framing the subjective assessments of judges as the source of racist sentencing disparities. The article also shows how COMPAS limited radical critiques of the PIC even after it reproduced racist sentencing disparities as it directed the conversation of algorithmic racism around questions of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and accountability.

N2  - The United States prison system and food system are both expansive and connected through shared histories of racial capitalism and human and environmental exploitation. This article reports on a qualitative case study of a sustainable food systems course taught in a Southern prison in which incarcerated students engage in gardening and food systems work. The study explores the potential for incarcerated individuals to contribute to food justice efforts, even within the constraints of the prison environment and despite their exclusion from formal democratic processes. The findings highlight challenges and tensions within the prison garden, including racial dynamics and administrative interference, which mirror challenges within the broader food system. The research suggests that while prison gardens and food systems education programs may benefit incarcerated individuals, universal food justice cannot be achieved without dismantling the underlying systems of oppression that make the prison industrial complex possible.

N2  - Background Incarceration is a social determinant of cardiovascular health but is rarely addressed in clinical settings or public health prevention efforts. People who have been incarcerated are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) at younger ages and have worse cardiovascular outcomes compared with the general population, even after controlling for traditional risk factors. This study aims to identify incarceration-specific factors that are associated with uncontrolled CVD risk factors to identify potential targets for prevention. Methods and Results Using data from JUSTICE (Justice-Involved Individuals Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology), a prospective cohort study of individuals released from incarceration with CVD risk factors, we examine the unique association between incarceration-specific factors and CVD risk factor control. Participants (N=471), with a mean age of 45.0 +/- 10.8 (SD) years, were disproportionately from racially minoritized groups (79%), and poor (91%). Over half (54%) had at least 1 uncontrolled CVD risk factor at baseline. People released from jail, compared with prison, had lower Life's Essential 8 scores for blood pressure and smoking. Release from jail, as compared with prison, was associated with an increased odds of having an uncontrolled CVD risk factor, even after adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, gender, perceived stress, and life adversity score (adjusted odds ratio 1.62 [95% CI, 1.02-2.57]). Discussion Release from jail is associated with poor CVD risk factor control and requires tailored intervention, which is informative as states design and implement the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services Reentry 1115 waiver, which allows Medicaid to cover services before release from correctional facilities.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heightened toll on people incarcerated in prisons in the United States, with those incarcerated experiencing a higher rate of infection and mortality than the US population more generally. What is less well known is the degree to which COVID-19 outcomes differ among incarcerated populations, especially by race and ethnicity, where significant differences have been found among the US population as a whole. This knowledge gap is, in part, due to a lack of reporting of COVID-19 outcomes by race and ethnicity by most state prison systems. To shed light on this topic, we analyzed mortality patterns of the population incarcerated in Texas state prison facilities during both the year before (beginning April 1, 2019) and the first year of (beginning April 1, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a unique data set of roster information from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and medical examiner records. COVID-19 mortality was 1.61 and 2.12 times higher for Black and Hispanic populations, respectively, when compared with the White population in Texas prisons. Strategies for COVID-19 mitigation in carceral settings, such as vaccination and decarceration, should include an equity component to minimize disparities.

N2  - Although the number of people incarcerated in the United States has grown dramatically, research on how incarceration affects individuals and the communities they return to has lagged behind. This may be because of the unique challenges of doing research within carceral systems and the relatively small number of investigators who are competent to undertake these efforts.
We provide a primer for investigators with limited experience conducting research in carceral settings and highlight considerations and recommendations that may aid those conducting health research with incarcerated persons. We follow this with an illustrative case example exemplifying how the considerations apply to recent health research that our team conducted on mental illness prevalence in a large regional jail.
Understanding how to effectively conduct research with criminal justice populations and systems is the first step in beginning to understand the effects of mass incarceration as a driver of health disparities and health inequity.

N2  - Geography, as a disciplinary lens, brings a valuable perspective to the study of the carceral, and carceral geography's concern for the spatial could provide a new explanatory perspective to the consideration of some accepted tenets within criminology, whilst at the same time offering a productive and useful ‘grounding’ of contemporary geographies of emotion and affect. In the context of hyperincarceration and the carceral continuum of recidivism and repeated reimprisonment, this paper considers the long-observed relationship between prison visitation and reduced recidivism, posits prison visiting rooms as underresearched carceral spaces, and develops theoretical and methodological innovations which nuance the understanding of prison visiting.

N2  - Substance use and carceral system involvement are often connected, highlighting the need for substance use disorder recovery support services among those leaving carceral facilities. However, no prior study has examined whether recovery housing and carceral facilities are co-located. Using data from the National Study of Addiction and Treatment Recovery Residences (2020-2021, N = 10,358), we examined availability of recovery housing proximate to carceral facilities. Results show that recovery residences are often collocated with state and federal prisons and detention centers in the US. Specifically, the odds of having any recovery housing are 74% higher and recovery housing density is 35% higher in counties with versus without state prisons (ps < 0.001). Findings for federal prisons were similar. Future studies involving individuals with SUD who are leaving carceral facilities should examine factors facilitating and inhibiting access to recovery housing as well as how recovery housing affects the communities in which they are located.

N2  - Transgender and gender-diverse communities are disproportionately incarcerated in the USA. Incarcerated gender minority populations are detained within carceral systems constructed around a cisgender (gender identity matches sex assigned at birth) binary (only male and female identities recognized) understanding of gender. This leads to marginalizing experiences while perpetuating the extreme vulnerability individuals experience in the community. In order to address this cruel and unusual experience, carceral systems should undergo “whole-setting” reforms to protect and affirm transgender and gender-diverse populations. This includes ensuring access to gender-affirming clinical care that aligns with community health standards recommended by medical professional associations. Implementing gender-affirming reforms reduces security issues and will likely improve health outcomes providing mutual benefit for both correctional staff and gender minority populations. Given the current divisive political and social environment for gender minority populations in the USA, evidence-based person-centered reforms in corrections are needed now more than ever.

N2  - Anthropologist-clinicians who engage in both ethnographic inquiry and clinical practice confront methodological, ethical, and epistemological predicaments that can challenge and enhance the moral practice and ethics of care inherent both to healing and to ethnography. Clinician-ethnographers often find themselves practicing within harmful systems that they also critique, such as hospitals or carceral institutions. This paper analyzes the dual practice of obstetrical care and ethnography in a county jail and a county hospital. These intertwined roles involve wrestling with sometimes conflicting vocational and ethical obligations to heal, to protect privacy, to address bodily consequences of systemic oppressions, and to critique the systems that mete human suffering. Developing a consciousness of clinical-ethnographers’ complicity, rather than disavowing it, can be aligned with approaches of abolition medicine to reimagine more just forms of healing.

N2  - This article examines how computer software mediates the way cities conceptualize relations between corrections, law enforcement, and urban space. Focusing on New York City, it builds on concepts from carceral geography and geographic studies of software to decipher the “coded spaces” of corrections and law enforcement, or spaces whose existence and morphology are partially determined by software. It does so through discourse analysis of technical documents from New York City criminal justice agencies and specialized publications on applications of software in corrections and law enforcement. In analyzing these materials, the article demonstrates how the New York City Department of Corrections and Community Supervision envisions software as a medium for embedding coded spaces of continuous surveillance, discipline, and capture across the city. It also chronicles how the New York City Police Department articulates software as a means of establishing functionally similar spaces of its own, albeit on larger scales. In each instant, authorities perceive software as a means of establishing intracity coded spaces in which correctional supervision looks more like policing, and policing more like correctional supervision. The article suggests that this coded dimension of surveillance, discipline, and human capture indicate new horizons for the geography of the carceral state, and merit further empirical investigation to understand their technicity.

N2  - Transgender and gender-diverse communities are disproportionately incarcerated in the USA. Incarcerated gender minority populations are detained within carceral systems constructed around a cisgender (gender identity matches sex assigned at birth) binary (only male and female identities recognized) understanding of gender. This leads to marginalizing experiences while perpetuating the extreme vulnerability individuals experience in the community. In order to address this cruel and unusual experience, carceral systems should undergo "whole-setting" reforms to protect and affirm transgender and gender-diverse populations. This includes ensuring access to gender-affirming clinical care that aligns with community health standards recommended by medical professional associations. Implementing gender-affirming reforms reduces security issues and will likely improve health outcomes providing mutual benefit for both correctional staff and gender minority populations. Given the current divisive political and social environment for gender minority populations in the USA, evidence-based person-centered reforms in corrections are needed now more than ever.

N2  - Access to safe drinking water is considered a universal human right. In the United States, exposure to arsenic contamination in drinking water disproportionately impacts small, groundwaterreliant communities and communities of color. These inequities are driven by a combination of natural, built, and sociopolitical factors. The United Nations calls upon states to especially safeguard the right to safe water for groups that may face difficulties exercising this right, such as incarcerated people. Limited research exists on water quality in prisons; however, prisons in the Southwestern United States have elevated arsenic concentrations compared with other community water systems (CWSs) in the region. Inorganic arsenic is an odorless, colorless carcinogen, common in California's San Joaquin Valley groundwater. In 2001, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lowered the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for arsenic from 50 lg=L to a running annual average of <10 lg=L.7 This stronger standard went into effect in 2006. In 2012, California passed its Human Right to Water bill (Assembly Bill 685) mandating safe, affordable, and accessible water for all.

N2  - Each year the United States government detains and deports hundreds of thousands of people who prior to their removal are held in confinement for an average of 55 days. The short and long-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic on migrant detention and deportation continue to be evaluated in real time, including how we can best study it. This paper provides a timely analysis on the relationship between immigration enforcement and confinement, public health emergencies, and ethnographic methods. It makes two contributions. The first is methodological and focuses on the challenges and opportunities of ethnographic methods in carceral settings when pandemic-related protocols have raised additional challenges to conventional in-person prison ethnography. The second contribution is empirical and documents how we adapted ethnographic methods to an interdisciplinary research design and to the exigencies of the pandemic to study the spread of the coronavirus in four immigrant detention facilities in New Jersey, USA.

N2  - This article develops an analytic of carceral structures that bridge processes of racist inclusion and exclusion. It does so by examining the relocation of a county jail from Detroit's central business district into a hazardous waste corridor. In recent years, county administrators have funded jail expansions using revenues from tax foreclosure surpluses produced by evicting majority-Black Detroit residents. Buildings that disappear Black people within the strictures of mass incarceration are financed by the mass displacement of Black people from their homes. Jails have been central features of Detroit's downtown neighborhood since the 19th century. Surrounding property owners celebrated their late 20th century expansions as a means of supporting districts experiencing the economic fallout of racist population loss. However, when county administrators ran out of funds to complete a jail expansion, developers successfully lobbied to transform the jail site into a campus of a majority-white university. Their plan included rehousing incarcerated people in new jails constructed on the site of unused warehouses adjacent to an incinerator. By attending to Black Detroiters as they navigate dislocations that make incarceration financially possible, this article argues that uneven development is funded by the articulation of racist displacement with racist captivity. In so doing, it offers a model for identifying the expansive structures of carceral institutions as they organize the production of space in the context of racial capitalism.

N2  - This paper demonstrates for the first time that prisons with a higher proportion of natural vegetation within their perimeter have lower levels of staff sickness absence. It makes three significant contributions. First, it extends studies of workplace nature contact into the un-researched carceral context. Second, whereas previous workplace nature contact studies have largely utilized single-site surveys, it presents national-level, statistically robust analysis. Third, it brings a novel new perspective to studies of sickness absence within correctional workforces, by considering the effect of the physical environment. Econometric estimations presented in the paper confirm lower levels of staff sick-leave in prisons with more greenspace. This relationship persists when we control for prison size, security level, age, level of crowding, levels of self-harm and violence among prisoners, and assaults against staff. The findings are significant in demonstrating the benefits of nature contact in workplaces in general, and carceral environments in particular. Importantly, this has the potential to influence future prison design.

N2  - SummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing epidemic of mass incarceration are closely intertwined, as COVID-19 entered US prisons and jails at astounding rates. Although observers warned of the swiftness with which COVID-19 could devastate people who are held and work in prisons and jails, their warnings were not heeded quickly enough. Incarcerated populations were deprioritised, and COVID-19 infected and killed those in jails and prisons at rates that outpaced the rates among the general population. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted what has been long-known: mass incarceration is a key component of structural racism that creates and exacerbates health inequities. It is imperative that the public health, particularly epidemiology, public policy, advocacy, and medical communities, are catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic to drastically rethink the USA's criminal legal system and the public health emergency that it has created and to push for progressive reform.

N2  - Applying Foucault’s concepts of disciplinary power and technologies of the self to the ex-periences of social work academics in English universities, this articles reveals their carceral existences, arguing that social work academics and their students exist within a “carceral network” which controls and normalises behaviour by simultaneously trapping them with-in and excluding them from succeeding in academic practices. While social work academics become “docile bodies” as they are shaped and trained by competing norms of neoliberal higher education and professional social practice, their position as insiders and outsiders to both can also enable them to resist certain disciplinary expectations. The findings of the qualitative study discussed in this article support Foucault’s analysis of powerful institu-tions but problematise binary positions of docility or resistance to disciplinary power with-in them. Lived experiences of ‘becoming academic’ in English social work education reveal how normalising judgements and hierarchical observation intersect with neoliberal forms of responsibilisation to create a carcerality rooted in “incompetence”; how “technologies of relationships” are used to mediate individual forms of responsibilisation, and how having to negotiate multiple disciplinary regimes can create opportunities for resistance to each.

N2  - ABSTRACT
The carceral state has been the dominant voice of state governance in the United States over the past forty years. This article takes the archive as a key site of struggle to understand the power dynamics at play with the development of and fight against the carceral state. Utilizing the intervention of the fugitive archival practice, the article analyzes the multifaceted ways in which Black residents and communal institutions of Los Angeles, California, develop strategies and techniques located within past struggles against what I call the carceral state archive. The carceral state archive consists of both the recording mechanisms of state power and the institutions and structures that buttress that power. Built upon a multilayered methodological approach, the framing of the argument includes ethnographic and archival analysis of communal institutions such as the Southern California Library, communal organizations such as the Coalition Against Police Abuse, and the community members who all form the making of the fugitive archival practice.

RESUMEN
El estado carcelario ha sido la voz dominante de la gobernanza estatal en los Estados Unidos durante los últimos cuarenta años. Este artículo toma el archivo como un sitio clave de lucha para entender la dinámica del poder en juego con el desarrollo de y la lucha contra el estado carcelario. Utilizando la intervención de la práctica del archivo fugitivo, el artículo analiza las formas multifacéticas en las cuales los residentes afroamericanos e instituciones comunales de Los Ángeles, California, desarrollan estrategias y técnicas localizadas dentro de las luchas pasadas en contra de lo que denomino el archivo estatal carcelario. El archivo del estado carcelario consiste tanto de los mecanismos de registro del poder del estado como de las instituciones y estructuras que refuerzan ese poder. Construido sobre una aproximación metodológica de capas múltiples, el marco del argumento incluye el análisis etnográfico y de archivo de instituciones comunales tales como la Biblioteca del Sur de California, organizaciones comunales tales como la Coalición en contra del abuso policial y los miembros de la comunidad que todos forman el hacer de la práctica del archivo fugitivo.

N2  - An introduction to my book project currently titled “Trans of Color Entrapments and Carceral Coalitions,” this short essay demonstrates how mainstream protrans identity politics have become influenced by procarceral politics. This piece introduces the concept of carceral coalitions in order to spotlight how and when coalition-building might perform a cross-identity, multi-issue, multicultural politics while also reinforcing ongoing carceral agendas and carceral futures. The manuscript attends to how 1980s Los Angeles charted a new era in which minoritarian social movement and civil rights organizing under the banner of “antiviolence” became dutifully tracked into a vision of winnable goals by way of law and order, and the endless multiplications of anti-Black criminalization and punishment that have followed. With brief examples such as the 1985 Los Angeles–founded K6G (formerly K-11), considered the first official self-segregated gay and transgender jailing unit in the U.S., the essay demonstrates how state-based gender-responsive entrapments have only further carved out penal pathways as models for securing trans “safety,” and how abolitionist feminist interventions might be possible in revisioning safety altogether.

N2  - While critical attention has recently turned to racialized police violence in US cities, another quiet development in urban policing is taking place. Hundreds of police departments have begun to wed database software with geographic information systems to represent crime cartographically. Focusing on the Chicago police’s digital mapping application, CLEARmap, the article interprets this development from the standpoint of racialized carceral power. It puts critical geographic information systems theory into discussion with critical ethnic studies and builds the case that CLEARmap does not passively “read” urban space, but provides ostensibly scientific ways of reading and policing negatively racialized fractions of surplus labor in ways that reproduces, and in some instances extends the tentacles of carceral power. CLEARmap’s data structure ensures that negatively racialized fractions of surplus labor, the places they inhabit, and the social problems that afflict them are only representable to state authorities and the public as objects of policing and punishment. CLEARmap is also used at police–community meetings and via the Internet to adapt public perceptions of crime to that of the policing apparatus, and mobilize the public as appendages of police surveillance. By tracing these phenomena, the article casts a heretofore untheorized dimension of the carceral power into sharp relief.

N2  - There are two prevailing myths about Japanese society: first, that it has a successful elderly welfare system and second, that it has a successful criminal justice system. Both of these myths reinforce a social imaginary where cultural values of family and community harmony make extensive state intervention unnecessary. Yet not only are both of these myths and their arguments deeply flawed, but they also obscure the more troubling reality that institutions of welfare and punishment in Japan are co-extensive, both keeping Japan's growing population of "excess" older people contained and controlled rather than providing ways for them to integrate and flourish. Elderly ex-offenders are some of the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in Japan today, with high levels of poverty and homelessness, disability, mental health problems, and social isolation. Those with a history of incarceration and, by extension, their family, face stigma and discrimination that further erodes their ability to reintegrate and puts them at greater risk of reoffending. Unlike in any other country in the world, older people in Japan have a higher rate of reoffending than other age groups. In Unsettled Futures, author Jason Danely argues that we cannot dismiss these individuals merely as deviants; rather, their circumstances reveal deep contradictions in the overlapping terrain of welfare and punishment, and the precarity that forecloses on possibilities for older people to build a good life.

N2  - This article investigates recent plans for the offshoring and externalisation of the Danish border. It traces a series of proposals launched by the Danish government to establish deportation centres on Danish islands for ‘rejected asylum seekers’ facing criminal charges, as well as the Danish People’s Party’s call for their relocation to Greenland. It reads these plans in conjunction with recent legislation enabling the full externalisation of asylum processing to Rwanda (and/or elsewhere), launched with the stated goal of ‘zero asylum-seeking’ in Denmark. These plans, to expel an unwanted population as far as possible and prevent new arrivals, extend an increasingly carceral and exclusionary border regime.

N2  - PurposeResearch shows that the physical locations of correctional facilities often contribute to environmental hazards. Research also shows that correctional facilities are often sited near hazardous or undesirable land(s). In combination, incarcerated individuals may be at increased risk of experiencing negative health consequences because of exposure to various environmental harms. This is especially alarming as incarcerated individuals lack the capacity to decide where they are detained. In these cases, health issues that may have developed while detained may extend beyond incarceration. Furthermore, incarcerated individuals are not protected by the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental Justice policies.Design/methodology/approachUsing a case study approach, the authors examine two specific correctional facilities in the USA to not only demonstrate the various environmental harms that incarcerated individuals encounter but also highlight carceral spaces as sites of environmental violations.FindingsAdditionally, the authors address the negative health consequences incarcerated individuals report because of exposure to these harms. They also argue that creating safer communities requires more than reducing crime and preventing criminal victimization. Creating safer communities also includes promoting environmental safety and protection from hazards that cause sickness and disease.Originality/valueThis work contributes to an emerging and growing body of literature that examines the intersection of carceral studies and environmental justice.

N2  - This article focuses on three overlapping layers. First, it illustrates multiple and incoherent expressions of the prison/street nexus in India through fieldworkin prison and a para (urban neighbourhood). Second, it argues that existing categories of understanding prison/street porousness - such as a 'deadly symbiosis', a continuum, liminality and a carceral state - are inadequate for explaining these expressions of the prison/street nexus in India, which is framed within chaotic environments. Consequently, I argue, there is a poverty of concepts in narrating the prison/street nexus in the global south more generally, and it stems from methodological concerns. Third, the article unravels the methodological lessons from the study of imprisoned populations to examine how these may be used to narrate urban marginality. I take recourse to Lorna Rhodes' illustration of'blind fields' and 'punctums', to show how these may be used to disrupt conventional and hegemonic narratives of urban marginality.

N2  - Electronic monitoring, often accompanied with house arrest, is used extensively across the United States as a means of pretrial supervision and as a condition of probation and parole. In this article, we bridge the literatures of procedural punishment and carceral geography to detail how this previously understudied process of transport from jail to electronic monitoring serves not just as a necessary bureaucratic process, but as a key moment of punishment and power. Utilizing in-depth interviews with 60 people who were currently or recently on EM in Cook County, IL, we argue that this moment of transport is itself a punitive experience. We find that sheriff’s officers involved in the transport process punish individuals through the manipulation of time and space, verbal threats, and infantilization. This punishment in transport instills a subjugated status that sets the tone for the EM experience, aiding in reinforcing the home as the new carceral space.

N2  - When societies in distress are faced with nuanced and pernicious social ills, they often respond by falling into a default posture of criminalization and incarceration. In answer to the drug epidemic, escalating homelessness, and acute mental health crises, governments- and the United States especially-seek solutions in the tried-and-true tools with which they are most familiar: police, prosecution, and prison. The result is a political philosophy that revolves around the prison, a "carceral logic" that pervades policy domains and transcends party affiliation. Climate change, which presents uniquely severe and complex problems for society, supplies a new operative arena for carceral logic. This Note urges those who subscribe to the ideals of environmental justice to take notice of this development and recognize a simple truth: carceral logic is not goodfor environmentalism. While some may consider the prosecution ofpolluters or the construction of "green"prisons to be essential elements ofprogress, the overuse of carceral machinery invites more harm than it solves. In the modern era of worsening climate conditions, policing and prosecutorial practices have stifled environmental activism and suppressed the movements of climate refugees. Dilapidated prisons expose their populations to toxins and natural disasters, and mass incarceration disenfranchises overincarcerated communities by depriving them of the resources needed to resist the creep ofmanagedpollution. The result is a fundamental and growing tension between the operations of carceral logic and the aspirations of environmental justice. Moving forward, the environmental justice movement ought to formally embrace decarceral ends and advocate for reduced reliance on the tools of the carceral state.

N2  - In March 1980, fifty men suffocated to death in the back of a police van, known as a Black Maria, in Lagos, Nigeria. In the Black Maria Tragedy, as it came to be called, several currents of Nigeria’s postcolonial history converged. They included the persistent problem of crime, the question of how much power to give men in uniform, and the problems of migration and regional integration (most of the victims came from neighboring countries). This article examines the 1980 incident not only for what it reveals about Nigeria, but about the larger workings of punishment in a postcolonial state. What techniques of punishment endured after the end of colonialism? Which of them did African governments find useful, and which did they discard? Where did the technology of the Black Maria come from, and what part did it play in the machinery of the Nigerian state? Looking beyond Nigeria, the Black Maria incident suggests that prison transport is an important part of the carceral landscape – and one that is easy to miss.

N2  - AbstractBackgroundThe prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in carceral settings face unique challenges. Transmission modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and addressing these challenges, but reviews of modeling work in this context pre-date the proliferation of outbreaks in jails and prisons during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review of studies using transmission models of respiratory infections in carceral settings before and during the pandemic. MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo to identify studies published between 1970 and 2024 that modeled transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in carceral settings. We extracted information on the diseases, populations, and settings modeled; approaches used for parameterizing models and simulating transmission; outcomes of interest and techniques for model calibration, validation, and sensitivity analyses; and types, impacts, and ethical aspects of modeled interventions. ResultsForty-six studies met eligibility criteria, with transmission dynamics of tuberculosis modeled in 24 (52 %), SARS-CoV-2 in 20 (43 %), influenza in one (2 %), and varicella-zoster virus in one (2 %). Carceral facilities in the United States were the most common focus (15, 33 %), followed by Brazil (8, 17 %). Most studies (36, 80 %) used compartmental models (vs. individual- or agent-based). Tuberculosis studies typically modeled transmission within a single facility, while most SARS-CoV-2 studies simulated transmission in multiple places, including between carceral and community settings. Half of studies fit models to epidemiological data; three validated model predictions. Models were used to estimate past or potential future intervention impacts in 32 (70 %) studies, forecast the status quo (without changing conditions) in six (13 %), and examine only theoretical aspects of transmission in eight (17 %). Interventions commonly involved testing and treatment, quarantine and isolation, and/or facility ventilation. Modeled interventions substantially reduced transmission, but some were not well-defined or did not consider ethical issues. ConclusionThe pandemic prompted urgent attention to transmission dynamics in jails and prisons, but there has been little modeling of respiratory infections other than SARS-CoV-2 and tuberculosis. Increased attention to calibration, validation, and the practical and ethical aspects of intervention implementation could improve translation of model estimates into tangible benefits for the highly vulnerable populations in carceral settings.

N2  - Background:
The literature on menstruation defines period poverty as the inability to access sufficient period products, education, and sanitary facilities needed to manage menstruation healthily and effectively. While research has identified shortcomings of healthcare in the carceral setting, period poverty behind bars has remained largely absent from criminal legal discourse.
Objectives:
The current study examines the interplay of period poverty and carceral control to introduce the novel concept of menstrual victimization, defined as the physical, emotional, and financial victimization that results from period poverty perpetuated through carceral control.
Methods:
The study uses qualitative content analysis to systematically gather and code journalistic accounts pertaining to the menstrual experiences of incarcerated and previously incarcerated females, criminal justice practitioners, and journalists. The analysis uses literary pieces (n = 99), which were coded deductively and guided by concepts related to structural violence and radical feminist criminology.
Results:
The findings shed light on the unique structural harms incarcerated menstruators face and reveal the dearth of needed empirical research on period poverty in carceral spaces. The narratives in the sample revealed how manufactured scarcity of period products within carceral spaces is used as a means of oppression by institutional agents. The emergent themes highlight how the intersection of period poverty and carceral control led to menstrual victimization characterized through shame, humiliation, control, and coercion.
Conclusion:
Potential outcomes associated with understanding menstrual victimization in the carceral setting are discussed, including reducing menstrual stigma, disseminating health education, minimizing health disparities, and ultimately, shifting modes of holding accountability away from oppressive, retributive, and controlling tactics.
Plain Language Summary
Exploring how access to period products is used to harm people who menstruate in correctional facilities using an analysis of journalistic accounts
Period poverty is defined as the inability to access sufficient period products, education, and sanitary facilities needed to manage menstruation healthily and effectively. Research reveals the shortcomings of healthcare in prisons and jails but period poverty in prisons is largely unexplored. The current study uses published media and research reports discussing menstruation in correctional facilities to examine how the control of period products, access to washrooms, and medical care impacts is used to harm people who menstruate experiencing incarceration. The findings suggest correctional staff leverage access to menstrual health resources to control, coerce, shame, and humiliate incarcerated menstruators. In conclusion, we offer potential reforms are discussed including reducing menstrual stigma, providing health education and care, and ultimately, holding staff accountable and shifting away from oppressive, punitive, and controlling tactics.

N2  - Drawing on recent participant observation‐based data from the Northern Territory's Victoria River region, I propose that the coercive and custodial arms of the settler state are predominant features of, and constant and permanent forces of rupture in, remote Aboriginal life. I use the term ‘carceral spectres’ to describe the ways hyperincarceration and hyperpolicing shape, disturb and, in particular, ‘haunt’ Aboriginal life, people, places and things. This framework has implications for the ways we might think about the multi‐faceted impacts of the radical incarceration rates of Indigenous people in Australia, and the experience of life in the context of ongoing colonial occupation and pervasive carcerality.

N2  - The carceral state has been the dominant voice of state governance in the United States over the past forty years. This article takes the archive as a key site of struggle to understand the power dynamics at play with the development of and fight against the carceral state. Utilizing the intervention of the fugitive archival practice, the article analyzes the multifaceted ways in which Black residents and communal institutions of Los Angeles, California, develop strategies and techniques located within past struggles against what I call the carceral state archive. The carceral state archive consists of both the recording mechanisms of state power and the institutions and structures that buttress that power. Built upon a multilayered methodological approach, the framing of the argument includes ethnographic and archival analysis of communal institutions such as the Southern California Library, communal organizations such as the Coalition Against Police Abuse, and the community members who all form the making of the fugitive archival practice.

N2  - Background
Understanding the health conditions of those under carceral control is often made difficult due to lack of access to data. Yet, as has been made clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, is that data is essential to understand the scope of disease and how best to allocate resources. To better understand the needs of criminal legal oriented research and non-profit organizations, we interviewed stakeholders to better understand how they use existing data, what data they lack, and what data they would like to have to optimally assess the health of people who are incarcerated.
Results
Stakeholders reported a lack of trust and data availability as key issues. Many perceived the few institutions that do collect and disseminate data as obfuscating data or having a bias in collection and reporting. Additionally, concerns such as balancing the interest of systems-impacted people with advocacy were described as concerning for participants.
Conclusions
To tackle these issues of transparency and availability, the authors believe that an independent oversight body could be instrumental to ensuring accurate and timely data collection and reporting. As many participants turned to creating their own data, coalition building could be influential as a large network of resources may support capturing the varied experiences of people who are incarcerated.

N2  - This article, based on ethnographic fieldwork in 2016-2019, examines methane extraction operations in Lake Kivu on the Rwanda/DRC border as a lens into understanding how energy futures in Africa are imagined and enacted within national projects of post-war reconstruction. In 2005, scientists suggested that the lake's dissolved methane risked oversaturation within the century. This spurred state-backed projects to simultaneously prevent a natural disaster and harness the methane to meet Rwanda's rising electrification needs. Two companies are currently building and operating methane-fuelled power plants. The article suggests that these energy projects, an integral part of the overall architecture of social repair in Rwanda, reproduce and generate forms of captivity and entrapment that are central to understanding the lived politics of 'carceral repair', a generation after genocide.

N2  - We aimed to understand clinician perspectives on mental healthcare delivery during COVID-19 and the utility of tele-mental health services in carceral settings. A survey was administered in November 2022 through the American College of Correctional Physicians listserv. A nationwide sample of 55 respondents included 78.2% male (n = 43) and 21.8% female (n = 12), 49.1% active clinicians (n = 27) and 50.9% medical directors (n = 28), with a median of 12 and mean of 14.5 years working in carceral settings. Most agreed that mental telehealth services could serve as a stopgap amid infection prevention measures and resource-limited settings with an increasing role moving forward (80.0%, n = 44) but may not be sufficient to replace in-person services completely. Access to mental healthcare is vital in helping achieve optimal health during incarceration. Most clinicians in a nationwide survey report an essential role of mental telehealth in the future, although they vary in beliefs on the present implementation. Future efforts should further identify facilitators and barriers and bolster delivery models, particularly via e-health.

N2  - The carceral edgeland occupies a unique position. At times, it is acknowledged; at others, it remains unseen by those outside its boundaries. In cases where the edgeland is architectural, such as a prison or a detention center, it can prompt viewers to consider the power dynamics exercised within. This article, however, is concerned with the possibilities for the edgeland to be moveable and embodied. Focusing on the transformation of the area of Masafer Yatta in the occupied West Bank into a military training zone, the article shifts the discourse from the connection between the edgeland and the symbolic power of carceral architecture to suggest alternative carceral edgelands: the occupying edgeland, wherein the moveable and embodied converge to form a tapestry of edgelands. The Israeli military presence varies in intensity, yet the result is the realization of Achille Mbembe's ‘infrastructural warfare’ (2003) that manifests through the moveable edgeland, and second, the embodied edgeland that is enacted by the military personnel who symbolize the state. In Masafer Yatta, the army's long‐term presence has had an impact on the communities that evokes Lauren Berlant's ‘political depression’ (2011). Building on Paul Farley and Michael Symmons Roberts' recognition of multitudinous edgelands (2012), this article suggests that there can be multiple carceral edgelands at one site, all of which facilitate exclusion and political depression through enclosure, whether through fences, walls, or moveable checkpoints.

N2  - Agrilogistics, a frame of mind and a set of behaviours that consider the environment as existing outside of humans and as inherently pliable to utilitarian and economic purposes, has determined human engagement with the countryside for centuries without second guessing the logics of its approach. Why are such agrilogistics maintained despite proving toxic to humans and other lifeforms? This essay argues that the genre of the pastoral, although based on ambivalence towards the dispossession and exclusion that structures it, forms a linchpin in sustaining agrilogistics' feedback loops between the imaginary, the material, and the social, thereby determining who does and does not gain access to the rural idyll's promise of 'the good life'. Such incorporated pastoral attitudes, I argue, are caught between idyllic habits of signification and the carceral effects and experiences that these idyllic habits effect on others. The essay offers the concept of pastoral entrapment to capture the ubiquity of carceral structures in the rural while indicating the persistence with which we remain tethered to idyllic renditions that actively cover such structures up. After bringing into view the historical imbrications between the countryside as we know it today and the confinement of people, livestock, and ecosystems in general, the essay proceeds to suggest that the rise of domestic colonisation in the Netherlands in the nineteenth century was heavily invested in rural idylls and could be approached as an agrilogistic enterprise that, despite its charitable overtones, encouraged harmful feedback loops between the exploitation of colonised populations (both impoverished and racialised), the depletion of the environment, and a drive for profit. Finally, such an agrilogistic mindset can only be undone by recognising how we remain tethered to pastoral models of thought and what such pastoral entrapment really means for those at the receiving end of it.

N2  - In America's prisons, long‐term incarceration carries fears that one could die in prison alone and abandoned. Death by incarceration looms as inescapable for myriad inmates who are terminally ill or “graying” in prison. These realities inform this study of a prison‐based hospice program staffed by male inmate volunteers in a mixed medium/maximum security facility. Of special concern are the experiences of the men who sit by the bedside of others who are dying. I begin with the assumption that prisons loom as states of exception, epitomized by the realities of substandard prison medicine, the devaluation of care as anathema to prison survival, and the persistent neglect of the ill and aging. The ethos and practices associated with inmate‐driven end‐of‐life care demarcate an inverted space of non‐judgmental praxis that simultaneously envelopes the dying man while also instigating self‐reflection, change, and self‐care among inmate hospice volunteers.

N2  - Drawing on extensive prisons research and sustained contact with (former) prisoners in Nicaragua, this article explores three former prisoners’ post-release trajectories. In the face of a hybrid state that manifests as both a legal penal state and an extralegal system of powers, colloquially referred to as el Sistema (the System), and to the backdrop of a (d)evolving political context, I argue for an understanding of the ‘tightness’ of post-release life by conceptualizing the Sistema’s transcarceral grip. Former prisoners deal with this grip in different ways, ranging from self-censorship to the taking of ‘delinquent freedoms’. A detailed understanding of this grip can help pinpoint how carceral logics are mobilized outside prison in Nicaragua and how its carceral state expands through not only legal but also extralegal means.

N2  - Across research on incarceration and insularity, recent trajectories have challenged conventional understandings of islands and prisons as isolated, autonomous units. Instead, they have directed attention toward their capacity to establish relations, circuits and routes. Beyond the focus on mobility and exchanges, this literature criticised the association between insularity, incarceration and confinement as the outcome of specific colonial epistemologies. This article builds on these literatures to investigate the case of Sardinia, a large Mediterranean island that plays a key role in the Italian carceral regime by providing a destination for thousands of Italian convicts. Despite being an Italian and European region, Sardinia's past and present exhibit distinct colonial qualities, which are visible in the structure of its carceral estate. The case study exemplifies how islands can hardly be interpreted as isolated units, given that their histories and geographies have implications that extend far beyond their coasts. In the case of Sardinia, the island combines modern penitentiaries with dynamics reminiscent of previous periods in the history of punishment, specifically penal colonies and convict transportation. This case study illustrates the benefits of an interdisciplinary approach that is willing to question the conceptual categories adopted, particularly those of island, prison and colony.
Short
The article examines how research on incarceration and insularity has moved beyond previous paradigms that focused on confinement and isolation. It then applies the insights from the literature to the case study of Sardinia, a large Mediterranean island that has historically served a key role in the Italian prison system.

N2  - This paper advances carcéral geographies by situating water in relation to the nexus of care and control in the carceral setting. Critical for both hygiene and health, but also requiring control and management, consideration of water offers an analytical lens to uncover everyday, intimate and embodied institutional spaces of care and control mediated by water both in its elemental form, and via water infrastructures. Drawing on extensive qualitative data generated with serving prisoners in the UK, the paper considers carceral relationships with water as variously and simultaneously unruly, restrictive, health-enabling and therapeutic.

N2  - This edited collection encourages philosophical exploration of the nature, aims, contradictions, promises and problems of the practice of education within prisons around the world. Such exploration is particularly necessary given the complex operational barriers to education, and higher education in particular, within prison-based teaching and learning. These operational barriers are matched by cultural and polemical barriers, such as the criticism of diverting resources to and spending money on prisoner education when the cost of some education seems prohibitive for people outside prison. More so than in other education contexts, prison education may fall short of higher ideals because it is shot through with both practical and moral-political problems and challenges, especially in the age of global late capitalism, high technology and mass incarceration or securitization. This book includes insights and issues around a wide range of areas including: ethics, religion, sociology, justice, identity and political and moral philosophy.

N2  - This paper suggests that although carcéral space seems to be sharply demarcated from the outside world, the prison wall is in fact more porous than might be assumed. The paper critiques Goffman's theory of the 'total institution' by deploying a geographical engagement with liminality to theorise prison visiting rooms as spaces in which prisoners come face-to-face with persons and objects which come from and represent their lives on the 'outside'. Drawing on a specific empirical example from recent research into imprisonment in the contemporary Russian prison system, it uses the example of visiting suites designed for long term 'residential' visits to explore the ways in which visiting spaces act as a space of betweenness where a metaphorical thresholdcrossing takes place between outside and inside. The paper specifically explores the expression of that betweenness in the materiality of visiting, and in the déstabilisation of rules and identities in visiting space. It contests the sense of linear transformation with which liminal spaces have previously been associated, suggesting that rather than spaces of linear transition from one state to another, liminal spaces can constitute a frustratingly repetitive, static or equilibriating form of transformation which is cumulative rather than immediate, and relates this suggestion to the wider study of prison visitation.

N2  - Australia's offshore immigration detention centers are characterized by a culture of secrecy that keeps human rights abuses hidden. Yet, detainees are employing new technologies and media to narrate their experiences of incarceration. This article examines the potentials and limitations of bearing witness and exercising acoustic agency through podcasting. It provides a case study of The Messenger podcast in which a refugee detained on Manus Island exchanges voice messages with an Australian journalist. It finds that podcasting can breach the secrecy that sustains a punitive detention regime and evoke empathy in listeners through the affective nature of voice. However, podcasting is limited by the sense of distance produced by prerecorded and edited sound and by the risk of creating echo chambers through the selective nature of podcast consumption. Finally, we adapt, develop, and argue for the concept of earwitnessing as a practice of responsible and political listening to injustice.

N2  - The opioid overdose crisis intersects critically with the criminal legal system where individuals with opioid use disorder (are significantly overrepresented. Subsequently, incarceration increases the risk of opioid overdose due to reduced tolerance, interrupted social supports, and limited access to treatment. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, have been shown to reduce opioid-related mortality and improve outcomes for those in carceral settings. Despite this, access to MOUD in jails and prisons remains limited due to stigma, concerns about medication diversion, and logistical challenges. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on MOUD in carceral settings, summarizing the prevalence of treatment programs, the role of novel formulations like injectable buprenorphine, and barriers to implementation. It also explores the continuum of care, emphasizing the importance of initiating MOUD during incarceration and ensuring continuation upon release to prevent treatment gaps. Recent policy changes, such as Sect. 1115 Medicaid waivers, offer promising avenues for expanding access, but retention in treatment and post-release outcomes remain significant challenges. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing literature and updates on MOUD service delivery, including the impact of recent policy shifts and research on outcomes such as recidivism and health improvement. It concludes by identifying key areas for future research, including strategies to improve treatment retention, address systemic barriers through criminal justice reform, and enhance care coordination during the transition from incarceration to the community.

N2  - The article draws on labour and migration bans in Nepal as a case study to advance nascent, yet growing attention towards trafficking borders in critical geographical research on anti-trafficking. It does so by highlighting a relational geography of carceral protectionist spaces which are encountered, navigated, and sometimes escaped by women citizens on the move who are pre-emptively rescued/‘saved’ from the possibility of being ‘trafficked.’ Specifically, we aim to extend these critical interventions on carceral protectionism in two interconnected ways. First, whilst extant research mainly focuses on institutions and actors within migrant destination states, we examine the operations of carceral protectionist spaces within the home countries of migrant women. Second, we tease out the ways carceral protectionist spaces can actively produce the very subjects they seek to deter or eradicate as they navigate and challenge these institutional spaces. Through the discussion, we develop threads of the conceptualisation of a carceral protectionist territory to indicate the multiple and diffuse, yet interconnected, sites through which women’s mobility aspirations are constrained by anti-trafficking infrastructures.

N2  - Recent calls to “defund the police” have seen a plethora of movements decry state funds allocated to the police and ask that those funds be placed elsewhere. In this article, we return to Michel Foucault to analyze how calls for rebalancing budgets away from the police force and towards social projects both rely on political categories established in Foucault's work and encapsulates an aporia that emerges through them. Locating shifts towards the carceral in the context of European modernity, Foucault suggests that policing moves away from the spectacular torture and punishment of sovereign and state and towards technologies of power that proliferate across the social body. Here, we suggest that in this movement between sovereignty and power emerges a central tension that Foucault is incapable of resolving—between an exteriorized sovereignty (death) that necessarily appears at the extreme limits of power (life)—which threatens to destabilize the domain of power altogether. Race—as it appears in the European frame and reaching a zenith in Nazi Germany—encapsulates Foucault’s attempted mitigation. If anything, this exacerbates the problem by rendering the terms of inclusion in the domain of power (of making life live) incoherent. To see why, we go on to show how freedom from racial slavery—as space of incapacity—is the conduit through which entry is possible into the differentiated power that supposedly limits the social. But as such, the slave precisely indexes the aporia for Foucault that cannot be sutured. The implications of this can be seen in the calls to defund the police insofar as it implicitly repeats Foucault’s shift from police to social power.

N2  - Background:
The opioid overdose crisis significantly affects marginalized communities, with people of color experiencing higher rates of overdose and barriers to treatment. The syndemic of opioid use disorder and mass incarceration exacerbates racial health disparities. Some carceral facilities offer medication for addiction treatment, though no significant research explores differences in type of treatment uptake by race in these settings. This study focuses on the racial differences in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) preferences among incarcerated individuals.
Methods:
A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC), examining MOUD-type preferences (buprenorphine or methadone) among incarcerated individuals. The study utilized RIDOC electronic medical records from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022, involving 3533 unique incarceration events. Participants were categorized by race (White vs non-White) and MOUD status (new initiation vs community continuation), with logistic regression models.
Results:
The study found no direct racial disparity in preferences for MOUD type. However, an interaction between race and MOUD initiation status significantly influenced MOUD-type preference. Among those initiating MOUD during incarceration, non-White individuals were more likely to choose buprenorphine compared to their White counterparts.
Conclusions:
This research provides new insights into the intersection of race, incarceration, and MOUD preferences. While direct racial disparities in MOUD type were not observed, the analysis uncovered a notable interaction effect: race influences the relationship between MOUD initiation status and the selected MOUD treatment during incarceration. Specifically, data demonstrate that the likelihood of choosing buprenorphine varies significantly based on both racial background and whether the treatment was initiated during incarceration or in the community. Further research is needed in different geographic settings to understand the broader implications to help guide equitable healthcare delivery in jails and prisons.

N2  - The discipline of public health is generally considered to advance a universal good and is often discussed as a moral and ethical mission that aims to empower individuals to take responsibility for their own health. However, the ardent promotion of public health discourses can also result in the hyper-policing and surveillance of marginalised communities, where the capital required to adhere to risk management is often systemically lacking or unobtainable. These consequences have become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many people who are unable to follow public health guidelines to mitigate risky behaviours - for example, due to homelessness - are punished in increasingly carceral ways. In this article, we propose the notion of colonial affect as a conceptual tool to understand the ways in which public health deploys the affective language of risk to justify the carceral management of citizens. We mobilise examples of strategies invoked to manage unhoused people during the COVID-19 pandemic in two Canadian cities, Vancouver, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario, noting how public health uses the affective language of risk to carceral ends. Such an interdisciplinary analysis of public health and carcerality helps reveal the palpable, yet slippery, characteristics of carceral spaces in our current epoch.

N2  - Purpose of Review
To describe existing evidence and identify future directions for intervention research related to improving HIV care outcomes for persons with HIV involved in the carceral system in the USA, a population with high unmet HIV care needs.
Recent Findings
Few recent intervention studies focus on improving HIV care outcomes for this population. Successful strategies to improve care outcomes include patient navigation, substance use treatment, and incentivizing HIV care outcomes. Technology-supported interventions are underutilized in this population. Notable gaps in the existing literature include intervention research addressing HIV care needs for cisgender and transgender women and those under carceral supervision in the community.
Summary
Future research should address existing gaps in the literature and respond to emergent needs including understanding how the changing HIV care delivery environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the approval of new injectable ART formulation shape HIV care outcomes in this population.

N2  - Prisoners increasingly appear in court from spaces of incarceration, linked by video technologies, and remote from the physical courtroom in which the legal proceedings take place. During these video-linked court appearances, prisoners are immersed within the oppressive aesthetics of detention, rather than in the dignified courtroom we idealize. This article examines prisoners’ sensorial experience of prison video studios and the impact such space has on their encounters with law. Video link technologies are examined as symptomatic of the sensory bias to sight that ignores the significance of the other senses, diminishing prisoners’ opportunities for engagement with and expressive participation in legal procedure.

N2  - Background
Despite the limitations the carceral environment may impose on mental wellness, mental healthcare is increasingly becoming a carceral endeavor. Over the course of the last several decades, prisons and jails have become the de facto mental healthcare provider for thousands of incarcerated individuals. Furthermore, practices like mandated mental healthcare for supervised individuals further broaden the population experiencing mental healthcare within the criminal legal system at large. This study examines the perspectives of nine individuals who experienced mental healthcare within the carceral state, whether in prison or on parole or probation, with a special focus on how attributes of the carceral state create ideological and functional barriers to effective mental healthcare.
Methods
Data for the parent study of this analysis was collected via in-depth, one-on-one interviews of about one hour’s length, conducted at six-month intervals over the course of 2 years. These interviews were analyzed using an iterative process of open-coding, thematic code development, and code application to participant interviews.
Results
The results showed a common perception of mental healthcare received within the carceral state as serving goals of the prison system, including control and punishment, rather than therapeutic goals of healing and empowerment. This often had negative implications for the quality of the treatment received, including patterns of diagnostic ambiguity, treatment that was ill-fitting to participants’ needs, and treatment that was undermined by the new trauma created by the prison environment. The results also highlighted racial disparities prevalent within the carceral system. Despite the barriers created by the subjection of therapeutic practices to carceral goals, participants demonstrated resourcefulness and creativity in engaging with these treatment modalities to reap benefits where possible.
Conclusions
Overall, these results highlight the inappropriateness of combining therapeutic and carceral spaces, the need for greater public attention to how carceral mechanisms disadvantage vulnerable populations, and the need for a cultural reconceptualization of mental illness such that it is met not with criminal punishment but appropriate care.

N2  - Amazon's Ring relies on infrastructural obfuscation to hide their infrastructures through urban camouflage (as doorbells, floodlights, sensors) while simultaneously expanding the carceral state and extending the industrial police-surveillant state. Through a critical analysis of the Ring surveillant assemblage, this paper reveals the way Ring and its associated apps produce fear and paranoia of the racialized Other, promote community buy-in that more surveillance will improve safety, while obscuring private partnerships with local law enforcement. I argue Ring cannot be viewed in isolation from its entangled corporate owner, Amazon, which relies on an ever-expanding infrastructural network, including surveillance of their highly prized package delivery service. Ring is more than individual community members installing doorbells with cameras that extend beyond their property into public space; it is the blurring of boundaries between police work and civilian surveillance, the reliance on obscured digital infrastructures that hide to whom and what users are connecting when they install a Ring device, and the expansion of Amazon's vast infrastructural power. By recentering critique on the infrastructural backbone, made up of discourses and fixtures, this paper argues for the need for infrastructural accountability from companies such as Amazon, who not only profit from fear, but actively reproduce structural violence through their data infrastructures.

N2  - Incarceration, along with its most restrictive iteration, solitary confinement, is an increasingly common experience in America. More than two million Americans are currently incarcerated, and at least one-fifth of incarcerated people will experience solitary confinement. Understanding the barriers to care people experience in prison, and especially in solitary confinement, is key to improving their access to care during and after incarceration. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with a random sample of 106 people living in solitary confinement and a convenience sample of 77 people working in solitary confinement in Washington State, we identify two key barriers to care that people in solitary confinement face: cultural barriers (assumptions that incarcerated people do not need or do not deserve care) and structural barriers (physical spaces and policies that make contacting a healthcare provider difficult). While scholarship has documented both the negative health consequences of solitary confinement and correctional healthcare providers’ challenges navigating between the “dual loyalty” of patient care and security missions, especially within solitary confinement, few have documented the specific mechanisms by which people in solitary confinement are repeatedly triaged out of healthcare access. Understanding these barriers to care is critical not only to improving correctional healthcare delivery but also to improving healthcare access for millions of formerly incarcerated people who have likely had negative experiences seeking healthcare in prison, especially if they were in solitary confinement.

N2  - Objectives. To determine availability of health care services, treatment for acute alcohol and/or opioid withdrawal, and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in carceral facilities in the Northwest. Methods. We queried 146 county jail and state prison facilities in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho (122 respondents). Availability of services were calculated, and results reported by state and facility type. Results. Four- fifths (80.3%) reported providing health care services; 41% provide access to care 24 hours a day. Wash-ington facilities reported the highest prevalence of treatment for acute alcohol and/or opioid withdrawal (90.7%) and MOUD (60.5%), followed by Oregon (90%, 32.5%) and Idaho (82.1%, 5.2%). All facilities that provide MOUD (n=41) reported providing buprenorphine; only one- third reported providing methadone. Conclusions. While facilities reported treat-ment for acute withdrawal from alcohol and/or opioids, there remains a lack of access to MOUD. Access to MOUD during incarceration reduces recidivism and overdose deaths and improves health outcomes.

N2  - Introducing the notion of “digital expulsions”, this paper argues that digital technologies in refugee humanitarianism are mainly used for hampering migrants from becoming asylum seekers and getting access to rights. Focusing on Greece, it explores which carceral mechanisms are enforced and sustained through the incorporation of digital technologies in refugee governmentality: it contends that it is key to investigate the specific harms that digital technologies generate on asylum seekers. The article intertwines scholarship on digital technologies in migration governance with carceral geography literature and shows that carceral mechanisms are enacted also through digital technologies. The paper draws attention to how in Greece asylum seekers’ access to the asylum procedure and to financial and humanitarian support is further obstructed due to forced technological intermediations. In the second part, it investigates refugees’ carcerality considering the increasing use of technology in refugee camps and in the asylum procedures: it contends that carceral mechanisms are enforced beyond detention and shows that these work by debilitating and choking refugees’ lives and stealing their lifetime.

N2  - This article explores the evolving dynamics of carceral domesticity in the context of Electronic Monitoring (EM) as a contemporary techno-penal practice. While the prison, as the main outlet for punishment, keeps blurring the boundaries between the private and public by challenging traditional conceptions of domesticity, recent prison reforms driven by mass incarceration and overcrowding, have led to the proliferation of EM-based house arrests as alternatives to imprisonment. However, technologies and punitive implications of EM on people and their households remain underexamined. Therefore, drawing on emerging theories, testimonies and government reports through a Post-Domestic lens, this article argues that EM devices, such as wrist bracelets and ankle shackles, complicate notions of privacy, autonomy, dignity, economy and safety within domestic spaces. It further discusses how such techno-carceral practices perpetuate and reinforce existing inequalities, particularly affecting gendered, sexualized, and racialized bodies disproportionately and consolidating the status quo of the criminal justice system. In doing so, the article engages with prison abolitionist theories to speculate on alternative approaches to transforming spaces and justice, by shedding light on the intricate power dynamics inherent in carceral domesticity and EM-based confinement, aiming to contribute to the discourse surrounding the reconfiguration of domestic spaces within the context of harm.

N2  - The size, scope, and implications of the carceral state, particularly for urban communities of colour, are currently grossly underestimated. This article suggests the need to move beyond the traditional debate about mass incarceration in the US to show how the ubiquitous imposition of fines and fees for low-level offences has wide-reaching poverty-enhancing and racially disparate effects. The author argues that local government institutions such as the police and courts, which comprise the carceral state at neighbourhood level, engage in daily practices that reflect the colourblind racism of neoliberalism, including revenue-generation, which necessarily produce and reinforce race and class inequalities. The American state has always managed and controlled black labour; the author compares the imposition of fines and fees in the wake of black Emancipation and Jim Crowism to the current practice of fines and fees functioning within the paradigm of neoliberal colourblind racism.

N2  - This article argues that criminal justice and health institutions under settler colonialism collude to create and sustain “truths” about First Nations lives that often render them as “bare life,” to use the term of Giorgio Agamben (
1998
). First Nations peoples’ existence is stripped to its sheer biological fact of life and their humanity denied rights and dignity. First Nations people remain in a “state of exception” to the legal order and its standards of care (Agamben 1998). Zones of exception place First Nations people in a separate and diminished legal order. Medical and health agencies have been instrumental in shaping colonial “biopower,” both in and beyond carceral settings to ensure that First Nations lives are managed in accordance with the colonial settler state project. This project is able both to threaten First Nations rights to live and to maintain settler self-perceptions of decency and care. We illustrate this discussion with reference to the tragic and unnecessary deaths in custody of twenty-two-year-old Yamatji woman Ms Dhu in 2014 in South Hedland Police Station, Western Australia, and twenty-six-year-old Dunghutti man David Dungay Jnr in Long Bay jail in Sydney, NSW, in 2015. Health professionals and police demonstrated callous disregard to Ms Dhu and Mr Dungay—treating them as “bare life.”

N2  - Background
Correctional systems in several U.S. states have entered into partnerships with Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) to provide healthcare for people who are incarcerated. This project was initiated to better understand medical trainee perspectives on training and providing healthcare services to prison populations at one AMC specializing in the care of incarcerated patients: The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). We set out to characterize the attitudes and perceptions of medical trainees from the start of their training until the final year of Internal Medicine residency. Our goal was to analyze medical trainee perspectives on caring for incarcerated patients and to determine what specialized education and training is needed, if any, for the provision of ethical and appropriate healthcare to incarcerated patients.
Results
We found that medical trainees grapple with being beneficiaries of a state and institutional power structure that exploits the neglected health of incarcerated patients for the benefit of medical education and research. The benefits include the training opportunities afforded by the advanced pathologies suffered by persons who are incarcerated, an institutional culture that generally allowed students more freedom to practice their skills on incarcerated patients as compared to free-world patients, and an easy compliance of incarcerated patients likely conditioned by their neglect. Most trainees failed to recognize the extreme power differential between provider and patient that facilitates such freedom.
Conclusions
Using a critical prison studies/Foucauldian theoretical framework, we identified how the provision/withholding of healthcare to and from persons who are incarcerated plays a major role in disciplining incarcerated bodies into becoming compliant medical patients and research subjects, complacent with and even grateful for delayed care, delivered sometimes below the standard best practices. Specialized vulnerable-population training is sorely needed for both medical trainees and attending physicians in order to not further contribute to this exploitation of incarcerated patients.

N2  - The Hellwig Brothers' Farm in Chesterfield, Missouri, became a carceral space during World War II. The Hellwigs contracted Mexican and Mexican American farmworkers, incarcerated Japanese Americans, and prisoners of war from Italy and Germany through the War Food Administration, War Relocation Authority, and Office of the Provost Marshal General to meet wartime food demands. Growers racialized farmworkers' access to space before the war, but wartime labor programs made the Hellwig Brothers' Farm a formal prison. This article argues that the Hellwig Brothers' Farm reveals the wartime combination of an agricultural preoccupation with worker mobility and the carceral preoccupation with making immobile prisoners productive. By focusing on how the Hellwigs configured their landscape before, during, and after World War II, this article demonstrates that farmers learned to control laborer mobility from the wartime carceral state.

N2  - COVID-19 created acute demands on health resources in jails and prisons, burdening health care providers and straining capacity. However, little is known about how carceral decision-makers balanced the allocation of scarce resources to optimize access to and quality of care for incarcerated individuals. This study analyzes a national sample of semi-structured interviews with health care and custody officials (n = 32) with decision-making authority in 1 or more carceral facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews took place between May and October 2021. We coded transcripts using a directed content analysis approach and analyzed data for emergent themes. Participants reported that facilities distributed personal protective equipment to staff before incarcerated populations due to staff's unique role as potential vectors of COVID-19. The use of testing reflected not only an initial imperative to preserve limited supplies but also more complex decision-making about the value of test results to facility operations. Participants also emphasized the difficulties caused by limited physical space, insufficient staff, and stress from modifying job roles. The rapid onset of COVID-19 confronted decision-makers with unprecedented resource allocation decisions, often with life-or-death consequences. Planning for future resource allocation decisions now may promote more equitable decisions when confronted with a future pandemic event.

N2  - In this article, we will analyse contemporary carceral surveillance dynamics, namely the increasing storage and exchange of prisoners’ biometric data. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in prisons, policing and security settings, we will explore how prisoners’ bodies are reduced to information and broken up into data flows. These flows move within and beyond prison walls, impacting how prisoner's data is shared (in)formally with other criminal justice actors (e.g. police forces). Such interstitial connections allow us to better explore the permeability and porosity of prison boundaries. Overall, we argue that prisoners’ data doubles are not spatially or physically restricted within cells and walls, as they circulate and are virtually managed at a distance. We urge to revisit and rethink the use of panoptic conceptual models when researching carceral spaces, its technological infrastructures and surveillance dynamics.

N2  - Background
The provision of contraceptive care for incarcerated individuals has been largely inconsistent and has contributed to, at best, inadequate care, and at worst reproductive abuses, violence, and coercion. While previous research has identified strategies to remedy known issues, to date, very few recommendations have been implemented across the carceral system. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of policy and practice recommendations to improve contraceptive care to reproductive-aged, incarcerated individuals in the United States.
Methods
We conducted this systematic review utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and framed it within the National Implementation Research Network’s (NIRN) Exploration stage. We searched PubMed, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, MedLine, Social Science Citation Index and reference sections of included materials. Basic study information, explicitly stated policy and practice recommendations, and discussions and conclusions that subtly provide recommendations were extracted in full text. We utilized a thematic analysis approach to analyze the extracted text.
Results
A total of 45 materials met the inclusion criteria. Seven overarching themes were identified: 1) policy changes needed to implement care; 2) need for contraceptive care in carceral systems; 3) justice agency barriers regarding contraceptive care provision; 4) policy barriers to contraceptive access; 5) funding strategies to improve care; 6) patient preferences for contraceptive care delivery; and 7) healthcare provider knowledge regarding contraceptive care. The seven themes identified shed light on the need for, gaps, barriers, and facilitators of current contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals.
Conclusion
This systematic review accomplished two goals of NIRN’s Exploration stage. First, the compiled evidence identified a clear need for change regarding policies and practices pertaining to contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals in the United States. Second, our findings identified several evidence-based solutions supported both by research and professional healthcare organizations to address the identified need for change. This study provides an initial blueprint for correctional agencies to implement the necessary changes for improving contraceptive care provision to incarcerated populations. The correctional system is in a unique position to deliver much-needed care, which would result in many potential benefits to the individuals, correctional system, and community at large.

N2  - It is well established within both the scientific literature and social discourse that policing in the United States has a history of racial bias. Black people make up a disproportionate percentage of the prison population in this country—a direct result of policies such as “convict leasing” and the War on Drugs, designed to hyper-police the Black community. In this article, we explain how the development of the U.S. carceral system is inextricably linked to slavery at its foundation, how the late twentieth century saw the development of laws that discriminately impact Black people, and why policing and the carceral system must be viewed through a lens of environmental justice. Using modern case studies, we argue that the U.S. carceral system is fraught with issues of environmental injustice, both historically and in the face of new challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to show that any path forward must be intersectional in its approach, and highlight that the environmental movement must incorporate social justice to address systemic issues of environmental injustice.

N2  - While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery everywhere, persons with carceral system involvement and opioid use disorder (OUD) were disproportionately impacted and vulnerable to severe COVID-associated illness. Carceral settings and community treatment programs (CTPs) rapidly developed protocols to sustain healthcare delivery while reducing risk of COVID-19 transmission. This survey study assessed changes to OUD treatment, telemedicine use, and re-entry support services among carceral and CTPs participating in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded study, Long-Acting Buprenorphine vs. Naltrexone Opioid Treatments in Criminal Justice System-Involved Adults (EXIT-CJS) study. In December 2020, carceral sites (
n
 = 6; median pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 3468 people) and CTPs (
n
 = 7; median pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 550 patients) participating in EXIT-CJS completed a cross-sectional web-based survey. The survey assessed changes pre- (January–March 2020) and post- (April–September 2020) COVID-19 in OUD treatment, telemedicine use, re-entry supports and referral practices. Compared to January–March 2020, half of carceral sites (
n
 = 3) increased the total number of persons initiating medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) from April–September 2020, while a third (
n
 = 2) decreased the number of persons initiated. Most CTPs (
n
 = 4) reported a decrease in the number of new admissions from April–September 2020, with two programs stopping or pausing MOUD programs due to COVID-19. All carceral sites with pre-COVID telemedicine use (
n
 = 5) increased or maintained telemedicine use, and all CTPs providing MOUD (
n
 = 6) increased telemedicine use. While expansion of telemedicine services supported MOUD service delivery, the majority of sites experienced challenges providing community support post-release, including referrals to housing, employment, and transportation services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this small sample of carceral and CTP sites innovated to continue delivery of treatment for OUD. Expansion of telemedicine services was critical to support MOUD service delivery. Despite these innovations, sites experienced challenges providing reintegration supports for persons in the community. Pre-COVID strategies for identifying and engaging individuals while incarcerated may be less effective since the pandemic. In addition to expanding research on the most effective telemedicine practices for carceral settings, research exploring strategies to expand housing and employment support during reintegration are critical.

N2  - The Colonies of Benevolence were an early nineteenth century Dutch utopian social experiment in pauper relief, domestic settler colonialism, and segregative rehabilitation; it served as the model for Mettray, held as the epitome of the 'carceral archipelago' in
Discipline and Punish: the birth of the prison
. This disciplinary experiment served as a model of 'domestic colonization' for more than a hundred years that was widely emulated throughout Europe; and was also applied in the distant colony of Java. Many have noted Foucault's failure to address colonialism in what more rightly should be described as a 'carceral archipelago of empire'. Here, I address the emergence of domestic colonization as a response to Liberalism's inner contradictions; between its protection of the individual rights of property holders, and the need to discipline, but not jail, the property-less. Only in this way can the colony's status as a 'prison designed not to be a prison' be understood.

N2  - In this article Patrick Anderson returns to his 2010 book So Much Wasted: Hunger, performance, and the morbidity of resistance to re-consider self-starvation and its implications for hunger as an ostensibly 'universal' human experience. The author begins by reflecting on two performances of the early 1990s in which he began to query the relationship between hunger and representation: a staging of Franz Kafka's story 'A Hunger Artist' and a staging of the Greek myth Erysichthon of Thessaly. He turns from these reflections to re-engage historical practices of self-starvation that convert hunger into both political argument and political action, and considers what he calls the 'gavage objects of state terror', including feeding tubes and restraint chairs - whose forcible deployment have been prohibited by numerous national and international medical associations. He argues that such technologies reveal a historical continuum with the present, enabling choreographies by which the state expands its control and containment of the political paradigms of hunger.

N2  - ABSTRACT
This article sits at the intersection of Black feminist critical criminology and feminist ethnography. Based on ethnographic research and in‐depth interviews with lineages of system‐impacted Black women in Los Angeles (grandmothers, mothers, and daughters), this work introduces the term penaealogy. Penaealogy is a methodological and theoretical tool to unearth penal genealogies. It is a bricolage term to map how carceral histories and institutions splice their way into the strong, tender, and sinuous threads of Black women's kinship; a quadra‐directional lens that investigates the structural, the interpersonal, the past, and the future. Through the exploration of this concept, the paper interrogates how punishment systems impact Black women's kin and specifically Black daughterhood, while also discussing methodological intimacy and Black feminist criminology.

N2  - Fundamentally shaped by queer and trans activism and labor, Los Angeles’ cannabis markets offer an opportunity to understand how “diverse economies,” as defined by Gibson-Graham, are dynamic, contingent political projects that require contending with power and difference. With data from nearly four years of ethnographic observation and 70-plus interviews, I analyze how numerous Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian and Pacific Islander queer women and transgender economic actors in cannabis have developed labor relations, collective institutional forms, and reciprocal exchange to make cannabis dispensaries a space of care and solidarity. Starting with AIDS crisis-era medical marijuana activism, queer economic actors have built affective relations at the scale of the body with patients, owners, and each other in ways that transcend profit imperatives and bridge across difference. More recently, in the face of economic exclusion and the pervasive gendered division of intimate labor, queer and trans workers of color have turned to the body as a scaffolding for collective action across scales. Drawing from resurgent social movement unionism in the region, they have led intersectional campaigns to protect more-than-capitalist elements of the industry and challenge the carceral state’s drug war. Bridging feminist economic and political geography allows insight to the spatially and temporally contingent nature of diverse, queer economies and their embedding in broader relations of racial, carceral, and homonormative capitalism. At the same time, such an approach centering the active politics of diverse economies surfaces the potentialities for multi-scalar movements to develop and sustain alternatives to capitalism.

N2  - In this article I consider a perspective in which the question of human dignity occupies a central place, not so much as a regulator of the institutions on which the rule of law is based, but above all as a concept that regulates the interactions between the individuals who are protected by them. Assuming the prison context as a suitable place for the analysis of the concept, I reflect on the role of violence as a moral (or moralising) element of human dignity in its "horizontal application". I intend to reflect on two interrelated aspects: on the one hand, the "sociality of violence", where each individual - valuing differently his role and status in the interaction - can be simultaneously a perpetrator and a victim of violence. On the other hand, my reflection takes up the idea of a "continuum of violence", according to which violence permeates and characterises individual and collective action without being interrupted by the change of context or circumstances in which individuals find themselves (in this case, prison).

N2  - In recent years a vast academic literature has developed around the concept of 'militarising' or 'securitising' cities and in particular the policy responses to the occurrence of crime, fear of crime and the evaluation of cities as strategic sites for a spectrum of large-scale increasingly destructive perturbations in everyday urban life, such as riots, protest and acts of terrorism. Increasingly policy interventions in response to such threats have embodied characteristics of the 'carcerai archipelago' where incarceration techniques and strategies are punitively deployed within public places of the city and embedded within the design of urban space. Such attempts at creating increasingly hyper-carceral spaces have often been supported by an array of legislation and regulation targeting the control of particular activities deemed unacceptable or inappropriate. This paper draws conceptually from the urban security literature noted above and emerging studies within the nascent sub-discipline of carcerai geography, and examines their convergence on the issue of Olympic security planning. This highlights the various spatial strategies and imprints that emerge from new conceptualisations and practices of securitisation, and how these might be seen to characterise an increasingly punitive state. Here Agamben's studies of exceptionality are deployed to highlight how lockdown' security often becomes the 'normal' option for Olympic cities, seen as being on the frontline in the war on terror, and how a range of uneven geographies emerge and are sustained in such locations before, during and after the event. Empirically the paper uses data from ethnographic research focusing on the experiences of security preparation for, and post-event legacy of, the London 2012 Olympics. The paper also seeks to highlight how lessons from the military-carceral security strategies deployed in London have been transferred to subsequent host cities of Sochi (2014) and Rio de Janeiro (2016).

N2  - This article offers a cautionary tale for efforts to decriminalize domestic violence through a retrospective analysis of Canadian feminist legal activism to decriminalize sex work. Both domestic violence and sex work are contested terrains of activism, litigation, and scholarship and have come up against the disparate views of criminalization as necessary to protect women from violence, versus criminalization as compounding women's potential risks for violence. Through the example of Canadian feminist jurisprudence in 'R v Bedford', wherein the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the endangerment of women as resulting from the criminalization of sex work, I explore the liminal space following this decision, and how regressive legislation was introduced to re-entrench carceralism in the breach of a seeming feminist victory. My focus is on how carceral feminism continues to occupy the liminal space as a force of colonial violence, further endangering Indigenous women. I draw linkages between several violent murders of street-involved Indigenous women and the severing of allyship among feminists, sex workers, and Indigenous women over the potential decriminalization of sex work. Finally, I suggest that opposition to the decriminalization of sex work is successfully argued by an emerging force of carceral feminism: neo-abolitionist feminists who have appropriated a politics of abolition and, yet, may have deepened carceralism in the lives of Indigenous women.

N2  - This commentary reflects on recent instances of anti-Asian violence and state responses to redress violence through data-driven strategies. Data collection often presents itself as an appealing strategy, due to impacted communities’ desires for evidence and metrics to substantiate political claims. Yet, data collection can bolster the carceral state. This commentary takes an antagonistic approach to policing, including the ongoing creation of data infrastructures by—and for—law enforcement through hate crimes legislation. We critically discuss the challenges and possibilities in building towards anti-carceral responses amidst ongoing racial violence and crisis.

N2  - This paper draws from the art produced in the 'Cell Count' archive, a quarterly bulletin that the Prisoners’ Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Support Action Network distributes to persons incarcerated in Canadian prisons. The authors use necropolitical theory to undertake a content analysis of prisoner art to gain insights into how carceral life affects the incarcerated. Specifically, prisoners convey prisons as death-worlds. The mass incarceration practices, which are a mechanism of settler colonialism and white supremacy, strip populations down to bare life. First, prisoners depict their carceral experience as a kind of slow, protracted process of dying. Second, they describe themselves using imagery of the dead. Third, they explore notions of escape or release through an angelic or spiritual afterlife.

N2  - This article - based on fieldwork conducted in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil - examines how those people most affected by carceral expansion pursue safety in an everyday marked by existential threat. Through a focus on a neglected sector of this population, namely adult women, I show how carceral encounters specifically - and informal, illegal and not-yet-(il)legal exchanges more generally - intersect with familial logics and imperatives to engender a capacity for action that I call 'extralegal agency'. Extralegal agency is central to a practice of safety that represents an alternative to the dominant model of carceral security. An extralegal agency approach to analysing interconnected prison/urban fields, which decentres masculinized criminal organizations and resists romanticizing the rule of law, enables a disruption of dominant discourses of and about the carceral state.

N2  - Organizational culture is an obscure and poorly understood part of organizational life. In scholarly work, researchers use organizational culture as both a catch‐all term and a black box of intrigue. The former suggests its omnipresence and ability to take the blame for all that ills organizations. The latter denotes a mythical and misunderstood invisible cloak that covers organizations and organizational life, yet is misconstrued, complex, and confusing. This paper presents a brief summary of the multidisciplinary history of organizational culture as a concept and operationalized term while simultaneously suggesting our knowledge of organizational culture remains at its infancy. Using prisons as a case study example, the authors consider how better to unpack organizational culture using sound and rigorous qualitative methods with careful attention to sampling and researcher–subject collaboration. Concluding thoughts note the importance of using culture as a dependent, rather than independent variable, so scholars will stop scapegoating culture as the answer to why organizational processes and outcomes fail and will instead recognize the study of culture as the problem itself.

N2  - COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings remain a serious threat to the health of disproportionately affected populations such as people experiencing incarceration or homelessness, the elderly, and essential workers. An individual-based model accounting for individual infectiousness over time, staff work schedules, and testing and isolation schedules was developed to simulate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to staff in a congregate facility and subsequent transmission within the facility that could cause an outbreak. Systematic testing strategies in which staff are tested on the first day of their workweek were found to prevent up to 16% more infections than testing strategies unrelated to staff schedules. Testing staff at the beginning of their workweek, implementing timely isolation following testing, limiting test turnaround time, and increasing test frequency in high transmission scenarios can supplement additional mitigation measures to aid outbreak prevention in congregate settings.

N2  - Contemporary culture is replete with carnivalesque representations of violence and this has accelerated with the development of online technology. Felony Fights is a website and set of DVDs depicting real combat between male former convicts and other men. Viewer responses to these clips reflect a complexity of meaning and symbolic associations between violence, power and masculine identities. Nevertheless, profoundly unequal relations of power shape their production and viewing appeal. The embodied and affective dimensions of marginality and poverty are presented in Felony Fights as evidence of the animal brutality and carceral character of the fighters. This resonates with populist explanations for criminal violence and mainstream portrayals of male masochism in which white men are depicted as a victimized social group.

N2  - The United States has approximately 5 percent of the world's population but incarcerates nearly 25 percent of the world's incarcerated population and produces nearly 25 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change and hyperincarceration are causes and consequences of structural racism and economic deprivation, which disproportionately affect structurally disenfranchised citizens, including lower‐income communities, communities of color, and people with disabilities. Empirical evidence exists regarding the adverse health effects of climate change and mass incarceration, which occur in cascading and overlapping categories and include preventable death, illness, and injury. Researchers underscore the medical vulnerability of incarcerated populations, who are increasingly susceptible to climate‐driven exposure pathways and mental and physical health outcomes involving extreme temperatures, natural disasters, infectious diseases, and displacement. Intersectional structural drivers, such as anthropogenic climate change and hyperincarceration, undermine social and political determinants of health equity. Policymakers and health professionals can advance understanding and mitigate present and anticipated public health threats by increasing transparency, accountability, and human rights protections with an emphasis on decarceration and decarbonization.

N2  - Based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork conducted in an agency that provides services to formerly incarcerated individuals, it is argued that the ways that formerly incarcerated men come to embody the interpersonal violence that structures the carceral habitus complicate the reintegration process. There is a dissociation between the embodied strategies and responses and the world which the formerly incarcerated person is attempting to navigate. Elements of the carceral habitus that are related to interpersonal violence are detailed along with the ways that the carceral habitus impacts the process of reintegration.

N2  - For all its history of intersecting empires, the Balkans has been rarely framed as a global site of race and coloniality. This, as Piro Rexhepi argues in&nbsp; White Enclosures &nbsp;is not surprising, given the perception of the Balkans as colorblind and raceless, a project that spans post-Ottoman racial formations, transverses Socialist modernity and is negotiated anew in the process of postsocialist Euro-Atlantic integration. Connecting severed colonial histories from the vantage point of body politic, &nbsp;Rexhepi&nbsp;turns to the borderland zones of the Balkans to trace past and present geopolitical attempts of walling whiteness. From efforts to straighten the sexualities of post-Ottoman Muslim subjects, to Yugoslav nonaligned solidarities between Muslims of the second and third world, to Roma displacement and contemporary emergence of refugee carceral technologies along the Balkan Route, Rexhepi points not only to the epistemic erasures that maintain the fantasy of whiteness but also to the disruption emanating from the solidarities between queer- and transpeople that fold the Balkans back into global efforts to resist the politics of racial capitalism.&nbsp; &nbsp;

N2  - The National Association of Social Workers “Code of Ethics” states that social workers have a duty to ensure that families are treated with dignity, respect, and a right to self-determination. However, social workers often find themselves working in institutions that contradict these principles, one of which includes the “child welfare” system. In Los Angeles the Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) markets themselves as the “largest child protection agency” in the United States and is responsible for ensuring the safety of over 2 million children. To “protect” children the system relies on the use of investigations, surveillance, and family separation processes. These processes have had significant generational impact on communities who are poor and Black, Latinx, or Indigenous. Due to this, several “child welfare” researchers are currently debating if the system should continue to exist in its current state, undergo drastic reformation, or cease to exist in its entirety. The current study attempts to add to this debate by seeking to better understand the context in which the system operates and its relation to the carceral state as described by system stakeholders and individuals impacted by the “child welfare” system in Los Angeles County. Using a Carceral Ecosystem framework the study begins to interrogate the discourse around “child protection” and how it has been used as justification for the involvement of families within the system, the proliferation of surveillance and surveillance technologies, and subsequent family separation. In further extending the Carceral Ecosystem framework, the study situates abolitionist praxis as perturbation event that encapsulates both imaginative possibility and realistic strategy towards a post-“Child Welfare” future.

N2  - Scholars have focused on algorithms used during sentencing, bail, and parole, but little work explores what we term “carceral algorithms” that are used during incarceration. This paper is focused on the Pennsylvania Additive Classification Tool (PACT) used to classify prisoners’ custody levels while they are incarcerated. Algorithms that are used during incarceration warrant deeper attention by scholars because they have the power to enact the lived reality of the prisoner. The algorithm in this case determines the likelihood a person would endure additional disciplinary actions, can complete required programming, and gain experiences that, among other things, are distilled into variables feeding into the parole algorithm. Given such power, examining algorithms used on people currently incarcerated offers a unique analytic view to think about the dialectic relationship between data and algorithms. Our examination of the PACT is two-fold and complementary. First, our qualitative overview of the historical context surrounding PACT reveals that it is designed to prioritize incapacitation and control over rehabilitation. While it closely informs prisoner rehabilitation plans and parole considerations, it is rooted in population management for prison securitization. Second, on analyzing data for 146,793 incarcerated people in PA, along with associated metadata related to the PACT, we find it is replete with racial bias as well as errors, omissions, and inaccuracies. Our findings to date further caution against data-driven criminal justice reforms that rely on pre-existing data infrastructures and expansive, uncritical, data-collection routines.

N2  - This article critically examines techniques employed by the Australian state to expand its control of refugees and asylum seekers living in Australia. In particular, it analyses the operation of Australia's unique Asylum Seeker Code of Behaviour, which asylum seekers who arrive by boat must sign in order to be released from mandatory immigration detention, with reference to an original dataset of allegations made under the Code. We argue that the Code and the regime of visa cancellation and re-detention powers of which it forms a part are manifestations of what Beckett and Murakawa call the 'shadow carceral state', whereby punitive state power is extended beyond prison walls through the blurring of civil, administrative and criminal legal authority. The Code contributes to Australia's apparatus of refugee deterrence by adding to it a brutal system of surveillance, visa cancellation and denial of services for asylum seekers living in the community.

N2  - In their forum statement, on class in the USA, Paul Durrenberger and Dimitra Doukas downplay the role of race in the history of class formation in the USA. I propose one way of centering race in working class history, through an examination of recent histories of the carceral state. Given its disproportionate impact on the poor and people of color, virtually all studies of the carceral state see the intersections of race and class as central to its nature. A promising literature probes race, labor, and class in relation to the structural economic transformations that accompanied the rise of the carceral state in the late twentieth century. Several works also address or center immigrant detention and deportation, and insert the debate into working class history. In the literature on the carceral state, class—and the working class specifically—is invoked in several different ways. In some cases, the literature addresses class directly; in others, it suggests questions that scholars of labor and class could pursue further. Workers and the labor movement played an important role in the creation of the mid-century social welfare state that both reproduced and challenged settler colonial racial ideologies and structures. A concerted attack on the labor movement accompanied the mass incarceration of the late century, including the criminalization of immigrants. Reading carceral studies from the perspective of labor, and labor histories from the perspective of carceral studies, suggests a more complex narrative than that offered by Durrenberger and Doukas on the late twentieth century travails of the labor movement;, the varied responses to deteriorating conditions of labor by workers inside and outside the labor movement, and ways in which a racialized and settler colonial past continue to haunt the neoliberal present.

N2  - This article offers a cautionary tale for efforts to decriminalize domestic violence through a retrospective analysis of Canadian feminist legal activism to decriminalize sex work. Both domestic violence and sex work are contested terrains of activism, litigation, and scholarship and have come up against the disparate views of criminalization as necessary to protect women from violence, versus criminalization as compounding women's potential risks for violence. Through the example of Canadian feminist jurisprudence in R v Bedford, wherein the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the endangerment of women as resulting from the criminalization of sex work, I explore the liminal space following this decision, and how regressive legislation was introduced to re-entrench carceralism in the breach of a seeming feminist victory. My focus is on how carceral feminism continues to occupy the liminal space as a force of colonial violence, further endangering Indigenous women. I draw linkages between several violent murders of street-involved Indigenous women and the severing of allyship among feminists, sex workers, and Indigenous women over the potential decriminalization of sex work. Finally, I suggest that opposition to the decriminalization of sex work is successfully argued by an emerging force of carceral feminism: neo-abolitionist feminists who have appropriated a politics of abolition and, yet, may have deepened carceralism in the lives of Indigenous women.

N2  - Following the massive prison expansion in New York State in the 1980s, there has been a growing panic that families of men incarcerated in two state prisons in Elmira, New York are relocating to Elmira and utilizing the city's welfare benefits and causing crime. Like in many other Rust Belt towns, prisons were constructed as economic development projects in this small, multi‐racial city, but failed to fulfill the promise of economic recovery. I highlight prison expansion and maintenance as a site of racialization that obscures the history of Black Elmirans and renders people outsiders in their own places. I show how prison workers extend and limit the practice of carceral state making in order to show how the carceral state takes shape in the post‐Fordist era.

N2  - This paper draws from the art produced in the Cell Count archive, a quarterly bulletin that the Prisoners' Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Support Action Network distributes to persons incarcerated in Canadian prisons. The authors use necropolitical theory to undertake a content analysis of prisoner art to gain insights into how carceral life affects the incarcerated. Specifically, prisoners convey prisons as death-worlds. The mass incarceration practices, which are a mechanism of settler colonialism and white supremacy, strip populations down to bare life. First, prisoners depict their carceral experience as a kind of slow, protracted process of dying. Second, they describe themselves using imagery of the dead. Third, they explore notions of escape or release through an angelic or spiritual afterlife.

N2  - Palestinians in the Occupied Territories have been subject to increasing confinement, starting with prisons in the 1970s and 1980s and growing into a regime of checkpoints and walls that encircle entire towns and villages. After a historical review of the incremental stages of this incarceration, the article examines the overall impact of prisons, checkpoints, and walls, based on observations garnered from more than a dozen research trips over two decades and a review of research by others. Although these architectures are built and used in the name of security, findings show that mass imprisonment debilitates the Palestinian economy, forcing Palestinians to flee or resist. The final section compares the Israeli carceralization of the Occupied Territories to the US occupation of Iraq, suggesting that similar, albeit more violent, processes are underway.

N2  - Argues that the huge prison population, dominated by minorities, in the US poses a challenge to urban governance given the high concentration of minority groups in cities. Thus, historical scholarship on prisons is drawn on to present examples of prison & political order that help contextualize the current era. At issue is why the US views the prison as a good solution to the issue of how to govern, & revealed is the web of knowledge relations between prisons & political orders along various dimensions: what mentalities & rationalities of rule are promoted through prisons; what technologies of knowing & acting on subjects & their relations are put into general social operation in & through their deployment in the prison regime; & what manner(s) of prison subjects or identities does the prison invest. In this light, four models of prison & political order are discussed: (1) the early-19th-century silent system penitentiary & the early republican political order; (2) the early-20th-century industrial "big house" & the patronage & machine-based political order; (3) the 1940s-post-WWII correctional institution & the New Deal political order; & (4) the late-1970s-present warehouse prison & the carceral-state political order. The role of the prison in carceral states, eg, CA, is linked to three aspects of the current political order: spatial governmentality, "zero tolerance," & "dangerous classes." Recontextualizing the problem of prisons & public order is then considered in terms of notions of "reentry," "inconvenient truths," & "no to crime.". References. D. Edelman

N2  - This article critically examines techniques employed by the Australian state to expand its control of refugees and asylum seekers living in Australia. In particular, it analyses the operation of Australia's unique Asylum Seeker Code of Behaviour, which asylum seekers who arrive by boat must sign in order to be released from mandatory immigration detention, with reference to an original dataset of allegations made under the Code. We argue that the Code and the regime of visa cancellation and re-detention powers of which it forms a part are manifestations of what Beckett and Murakawa call the 'shadow carceral state', whereby punitive state power is extended beyond prison walls through the blurring of civil, administrative and criminal legal authority. The Code contributes to Australia's apparatus of refugee deterrence by adding to it a brutal system of surveillance, visa cancellation and denial of services for asylum seekers living in the community.

N2  - This dissertation examines the way people care for one another within the context of incarceration, specifically in Saskatchewan, where the overwhelming majority of prisoners in provincial correctional facilities are Indigenous and staff are predominantly white, and where there is an assemblage of carceral-correctional institutions – a carceral-corrections industry – that has historically operated to facilitate settler-colonial expansion through sequestering Indigenous people and subjecting them to techniques and technologies geared toward reformation (aka “correction”). Drawing on twenty-two months of fieldwork, including participant observation in public forums, court rooms, and academic/industry conferences, archival research, and interviews with formerly incarcerated people and correctional staff, this dissertation attends to relations of care between and among those caught up in the carceral- corrections industry, either via conflict with the criminal justice system or through employment within it – what I term here “carceral care”. In so doing, it moves beyond monolithic representations of the settler state, focusing on the people who animate and mediate it, the roles they assume, the discourses they employ, their day-to-day practices, and the meaning they make of all this. This unsettles structural analyses of Indigenous over-incarceration and highlights the persistence of both coloniality and Indigeneity, locating the agency of Indigenous political and social actors – including prisoners – within an industry geared toward undermining Indigenous sovereignty, self-determination, and wellbeing (both collective and individual).The reality of caring relations within institutions of confinement – which are animated equally by the impetus to cage and punish (carceral) and the commitment to rehabilitate (corrections) – is not a straightforward story of oppression and resistance, of staff versus prisoners, of settler versus Indigenous peoples. This dissertation is my attempt to honour and account for the varied, complex, and emergent forms of carceral care – to document instances of care-as-violence, acts and relations that save, support, and sustain, and all that lies between. Caring relations between and among prisoners and staff are simultaneously marked by paternalism, maternalism, racism, loathing, dehumanization, and fear of contagion as well as empathy, humour, respect, and reciprocity. They evidence lines of fracture, failure, multiplicity, ambivalence, and, crucially, illuminate possibilities of life beyond settler-coloniality.

N2  - This chapter examines the impacts of technologies on the space of the administration of justice. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has distilled the significance of closely examining the emergence of digital justice. With a focus on the increasing use of audiovisual communication technologies, the chapter scrutinises the spatial implications of technological linkage between civic courtrooms and non-public carceral spaces. Digital communication technologies result in courtroom space being dispersed, distributed, or dematerialised to prison video link studios and other remote sites. With the prison video link studio treated as a conceptual extension of the courtroom, there is a conflation of the space of the administration of justice with the non-neutral and closed environment of state prosecution and punishment. Does this spatial conflation blur the lines between the functions of the judiciary and the executive, and undermine the principles of open and impartial justice?

N2  - This study investigates the impact of human trafficking laws and digital carceral technologies on Asian migrant massage workers in the United States. Drawing on community-engaged oral histories and my advocacy in human trafficking legal cases, it highlights the survival strategies these workers adopt in response to digital carceral surveillance. The paper introduces the concept of the digital imperial shackle , which reveals the punitive mechanisms of racialized, sexual, migrant, and moral control within U.S. imperialism. Despite the constraints of these digital carceral systems, Asian migrant massage workers utilize non-digital strategies to navigate their daily lives. This research reinterprets their survival tactics as a form of visceral knowledge, challenging the prevailing discourses on the intersection of digital technology, trafficking, and anti-sex work regimes.

N2  - This article offers a critical genealogy of the neoliberal-carceral state by engaging the writing of Black Liberation Army member Assata Shakur. Shakur's work is read as a black feminist theorization of neoliberalism at the very moment of its emergence. By engaging Shakur's discussion of race, gender, time, and the market, the article pursues a connection between chattel slavery and the present that has yet to garner attention among scholars: slavery's haunting possession of neoliberalism. Although slavery's antiblack technologies inhabit and structure the prison, they also live on in the operations of the market. In particular, this article examines the relationship between the carceral, the market, the body, and population to consider how the necropolitics of slavery possess and drive the biopolitics of neoliberalism. The author argues that under neoliberalism, the market not only colludes with the prison, but also mimics it.

N2  - Drawing on three strains of critical theory - Foucauldian biopolitics, critical race theory, and the work of sociologist Loic Wacquant - I argue that neoliberal stigma is foundational to the design of the food (assistance) system. Neoliberal stigma is constituted in the discursive practices of shame, suspicion, and surveillance, which are communicative and carceral technologies used to discipline poor and racialized communities in their efforts to manage hunger and poverty. These communicative technologies are rooted in anti-poor, racist, and carceral logics and are deployed against Black and Brown bodies negatively impacting health and social wellbeing. Drawing on the voices of people with lived experiences of hunger, I demonstrate the mundane and exceptional ways in which shame, suspicion, and surveillance emerge in discursive practices surrounding food assistance and how these practices enjoin food assistance and carcerality into a 'single organizational contraption.' The analysis ends with three broad interventions required to disrupt neoliberal stigma amid racist violence.

N2  - The criminal justice system is increasingly becoming the subject of national dialogue throughout the United States due to the sheer number of people it impacts: according to the Department of Justice, nearly 7 million, or 1 in 35, U.S. residents are under some form of correctional control. The four books reviewed in this essay derive their findings from ethnographic methods that offer deep insights into the carceral state's everyday operations in individual women's lives, while raising profound theoretical and practical questions about gender and governance. We engage with these texts from unique situated standpoints as insider-outsiders with intimate knowledge of the U.S. criminal justice system gleaned from our respective lived experiences, services provision work, and research with currently and formerly incarcerated Wyoming women.

N2  - Theorizing situates bystander intervention approaches to combatting street sexual harassment as either an anti-carceral mode of social justice concerned with citizen responsibility and reshaping community norms or a carceral practice that shifts forms and sites of penal power. This article examines the intersection and effect of carceral and anti-carceral framing techniques in the 2015 "The Harasser is a Criminal" media campaign deployed by the Egyptian anti-sexual harassment initiative HarassMap to promote bystander intervention. Situated within a sphere of Egyptian gender activism that is transnational, secular, and feminist-oriented, and operating within a militarized, authoritarian political context, HarassMap's campaign complicates how bystander intervention is instrumentalized as a technology of power to shape subjective and intersubjective responses to Egypt's street sexual harassment problem. Carceral and anti-carceral currents flow together in their campaign not to promote a reliance on police or juridical structures for redress, but to cultivate new ethical dispositions as a means of mobilizing individuals to act. Through the figure of the bystander, HarassMap is engaged in a biopolitical project which seeks to create new neoliberal subjects who police themselves and assume responsibility for their own behavior in public space.

N2  - Michel Foucault argued that a key modality of state racism is biopower, through which the life of populations is differentially supported, shaped, and neglected. However, Foucault’s account of state racism is unfinished, because it fails to identify the modalities of power that persist when states withdraw life-supporting technologies from racialized populations, thereby committing “indirect murder.” This article develops Foucault’s account of racism and the racial state by describing the carceral technologies that expand with the withdrawal of biopower. To do so, it draws on Foucault’s theorization of carcerality in Discipline and Punish. It argues that biopolitical withdrawal is doubled by a simultaneous carceral investment, such that the state’s denial of life-supporting technologies occurs in tandem with the racially structured policing of the poor. Additionally, this article explains how Foucault’s concept of the management of illegalisms identifies a key vehicle of racialization, and illuminates the utility of carceral systems to racial capitalism.

N2  - People who are incarcerated are likely to meet criteria for at least one substance use disorder and need access to treatment. Access to such interventions was limited prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and has almost certainly been restricted further due to implementation of procedures intended to stop the spread of the virus. In this brief commentary, we discuss how COVID-19 has revealed the already tenuous access that people who are incarcerated have to behavioral health services, and the pitfalls of reliance on the U.S. carceral system as a response to addiction.

N2  - As audio visual communication technologies are installed in prisons, these spaces of incarceration are networked with courtrooms and other non-contiguous spaces, potentially facilitating a process of permeability. Jurisdictions around the world are embracing video conferencing and the technology is becoming a major interface for prisoners' interactions with courts and legal advisers. In this paper, I draw on fieldwork interviews with prisoners from two correction centres in New South Wales, Australia, to understand their subjective and sensorial experiences of using video links as a portal to the outside world. These interviews raised many issues including audio permeability: a soundtrack of incarceration sometimes infiltrates into the prison video studio and then the remote courtroom, framing the prisoner in the context of their detention, intruding on legal process, and affecting prisoners' comprehension and participation.

N2  - This research examines how carceral mechanisms produce various forms of environmental injustice in Colorado. While other research has examined the production of environmental injustice within prison spaces—for instance, the siting of prisons near polluted areas or on top of toxic sites—I expand on this work to examine how carceral mechanisms produce environmental injustice beyond the confines of the prison. Through archival research on Colorado’s settler colonial and convict labor history, and contemporary qualitative research in Cañon City, Colorado, I show how carceral power has enabled Colorado’s settler colonial conquest of the land, development of infrastructure and scenic tourism, and the disciplining of environmental activists in ways that perpetuate multiple forms of environmental injustice. I argue that carceral power is foundational to the political, economic, and environmental development of Colorado, and that carceral mechanisms function as methods of dispossession, discipline, and elimination that produce various forms of environmental injustice throughout society, not only within the prison walls.

N2  - Captive States: Migration and Expulsion on the Carceral Frontier examines how the amalgamation of U.S. immigration policies, the global drug war, and violent bureaucracies have transformed the U.S.-Mexico borderland region into a zone of captivity for Central American migrants and Mexican deportees. Based on eighteen months of ethnographic fieldwork, this project examines the everyday lives and survival strategies of these communities in Tijuana, Mexico. Moving between migrant and homeless encampments, governmental and private shelters, drug rehabilitation centers, and activist clinics, my dissertation analyzes the lives of those subjected to intersecting forms of confinement and dispossession at the U.S.-Mexico border.For several years, Tijuana has consistently received the highest portion of deported Mexicans from the United States in the country. Simultaneously, the U.S. government has implemented several policies aimed at stalling the influx of asylum seekers into the country. From the “metering” system initiated under the Obama administration to the Migrant Protection Protocols and Title 42 policies implemented by the Trump administration, these measures have erected an arcane bureaucratic wall against asylum seekers. Though deportees and asylum seekers arrive to the border region through different routes, my project demonstrates how a transnational assemblage that I refer to as the carceral frontier seeks to confine the movements of both communities while exploiting their vulnerabilities.

N2  - The events of September 11, 2001 unleashed a series of security measures designed ostensibly to protect Western nations from terrorist attacks. Many of these measures were aimed at keeping out potential terrorists and neutralizing potential terrorist activities. However, many were also aimed at citizens within the nation, legitimizing their exclusion and denial of rights. Drawing on the case of Omar Khadr, this paper argues that the carceral net ensnaring Omar Khadr was in operation well before 2001. However, since then, the carceral net has tightened to render Muslim bodies unworthy on the grounds of their putative criminality, and as undeserving victims, unbefitting state intervention and societal sympathy. The colour line, I argue, demarcates bodies that are considered worthy as opposed to those precarious others who can be penalized by the state and whose lives simply do not matter. Race, class and gender intersect and interlock to construct particular representations of victimhood as demonstrated by contemporary media representations of Muslim women. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

N2  - Recidivism risk assessment instruments are used in high-stakes pre-trial, sentencing, or parole decisions in nearly every U.S. state. These algorithmic decision-making systems, which estimate a defendant's risk of rearrest or reconviction based on past data, are often presented as an 'evidence-based' strategy for criminal legal reform. In this dissertation, I critically examine how automated decision-making systems like these shape, and are shaped by, social values. I begin with an analysis of algorithmic bias and the limits of technical audits of algorithmic decision-making systems; the subsequent chapters invite readers to consider how social values can be expressed and reinforced by risk assessment instruments in ways that go beyond algorithmic bias. I present novel analyses of the impacts of the Sentence Risk Assessment Instrument in Pennsylvania and cybernetic models of crime in the 1960s Soviet Union. Drawing on methods from history and philosophy of science, sociology, and legal theory, I show not only how societal values about punishment and control shape (and are shaped by) the use of these algorithms – a phenomenon I term domain distortion– but also how the instruments interact with their users – judges – and existing institutional norms around measuring and sentencing crime. My empirical and theoretical findings illustrate the kinds of insidious algorithmic harms that rarely make headlines, and serve as a tonic for the exaggerated and speculative discourse around AI systems in the criminal legal system and beyond.

N2  - During an historic re-articulation of incarceration in New York City, Refusing Rehabilitation: Outlaw Epistemologies and the Carceral-Therapeutic State explores how gender, race, and class have been transformed at the intersection of criminal legal system reform and the overdose crisis. I take up how multiracial groups of criminalized women—thrown together by the state, not by choice—refuse forms of state control and violence, and imagine together alternative “outlaw” horizons of justice, healing, drug use, and escape from carceral-therapeutic capture. Countering the individualizing mandate of rehabilitation, women in rehab articulate visions of healing grounded in interdependence, collective safety, and an end to structural violence, not individual responsibility. In meditating on what it means to desire collective freedom from state violence, I show how the lives of criminalized women reveal durable practices refuting the liberal project of reform, which seeks to violently subjugate and domesticate those it purports to transform. Focusing on women’s experiences with court-coerced drug treatment, I argue that “alternatives to incarceration” programs trap working-class women who use drugs in complex webs of surveillance and punishment concealed by talk of decarceration, racial justice, and recovery. Traveling across sites of state violence, I show that medical and criminological, therapeutic and punitive approaches to the management of “substance use” as a social problem are deeply intertwined in the “carceral-therapeutic state,” revealing “rehabilitation” as a logic of social control. Through ethnographic research in NYC drug courts and, a residential drug treatment program in Queens, archival research, and correspondence with currently incarcerated people, I argue that practices and ideologies of “rehabilitation” simultaneously secure a racialized class available for perpetual carceral-therapeutic capture and secure whiteness as magnanimous, civilizing, intervening force, always overcoming the (past) violence of its instantiation. At a moment when prison and jail reformers are arguing for a return to the “rehabilitative” penal ideal, this dissertation refuses this romantic rhetoric and thus provocatively argues for the abolition of rehabilitation itself. Across a range of presumptively-progressive reforms—supervised release, alternatives to incarceration, “problem-solving” courts, and summons-instead-of-arrests— New York has positioned itself as the vanguard of the end of mass incarceration and an anti-racist vanguard besides. But rather than ameliorating anti-Black, patriarchal, and ableist state violence, these reforms have created new tangles of coercion and control under the sign of “rehabilitation,” which redistribute, rather than eliminate, criminalization’s geographies, logics, institutions, and effects. In tracing how the state takes up a particular vision of womanhood that reinscribes courts, jails, and rehabs as gender-responsive technologies, I show how these reforms reproduce investments in carcerality as sites of gendered, racialized management. Thus, contrary to liberal promise, reformism functions to disarticulate and redistribute the carceral system. Informed by abolitionist organizing and research methodologies, this dissertation focuses on sites of collective struggle and theorization against state violence located within the state-sponsored sequence of “rehabilitation” to work against the social destabilization produced by policing and incarceration. In so doing, it centers what I call “outlaw epistemologies” among people surviving state violence yet often structurally interrupted from theorizing it together. Thus, I have tried to theorize alongside the people in this text where they are, not in some promised-but-often-never-actualized space of “redemption” and “rebirth” distanced from the prison industrial complex, coerced rehabilitation, and their ancillary environs. I hold fast to the notion that there is something to be learned—about liberation, about pleasure, about embodiment, and struggle—from those whose forms of life have been criminalized and repressed, not just by the state, but by white cisheteronormative and bourgeois hegemony, who nonetheless strive to inhabit those repressed forms. Thus, this text experiments with forms of polyvocality and textual collaboration, the nestling of different, and often dissonant and provisional, analyses, stories, and voices of criminalized people who use drugs. If nothing else, I hope that this dissertation convinces the reader that within a racist-sexist carceral-therapeutic regime, rehabilitation will never be outside punishment. If imaginaries of reform subtend the progressive carceral apparatus, so too is the white liberal promise of rehabilitation subtended by the fiction that it escapes the violent domination and coercion of the prison.

N2  - This thesis analyses the relationship between American documentary and the reorganisation of the carceral apparatus in the United States from 1964 to 1980. Centring on the work of Danny Lyon, Bruce Jackson, and Leonard Freed, this project examines how these photographers used their cameras, as well as the magazine page and the photobook, to investigate the shifting terrain of prisons and policing alongside the civil rights movement and after. Beginning with Bruce Jackson's first foray into the South's prison farms as a young folklorist and ending with the publication of Magnum photographer Leonard Freed's photobook Police Work, this dissertation historicises documentary and its work, probing the ways in which these photographers negotiated the unstable intersection of the museum, the archive, and mass culture that characterised the 1960s and 1970s. By considering the practice and circulation of documentary historically, Still Lives recasts the static categories that are normally employed to write out official histories of photography as dynamic and fluid, challenging prevailing conceptions of documentary as an insufficiently critical mode of photography. Instead, this project argues, these photographers ask us to consider documentary not simply as an act of capturing reality, but rather as a process of mediation--one that compels a reckoning with the American carceral state as always existing within visual representation. This project not only embarks on a reexamination of documentary and its histories, but also undertakes a major reevaluation of American photography and its racial politics. By shifting our focus away from photographs of protest, Still Lives complicates the dominant idea of "civil rights photography" and challenges the discursive boundaries that constitute it. In contrast with more well-known, iconic images of the civil rights movement--ones which figure this era as a moment of rupture with America's racial caste system--these photographers, I argue, reframe these decades as a moment of transition between modes of subjection. Rather than easily assimilate into a narrative of national progress, in which the civil rights era is positioned as a juncture in which America's history of racial domination is overcome, these photographs make visible the ways in which, even during the 1960s and after, the circumscribed humanity of the slave was remapped and reinscribed. Moreover, by foregrounding apparatuses of racialisation, as opposed to racialised bodies, this project expands the ways in which race has been examined photographically. In doing so, Still Lives suggests that, in order to understand the ongoing and incomplete project of emancipation that persists in our own moment, the networks of capture and control that constitute the American carceral state must be placed at the very centre of our histories of photography.

N2  - From around 1600 to 1782, the Palazzo Chiaramonte-Steri in Sicily functioned as the site of the Spanish Inquisition’s prison. During this period thousands of prisoners accused of crimes and heresy against the Catholic faith made their marks on the Steri prison’s walls, leaving inscriptions and images that reference early modern popular culture, history, literature, art, and religious iconography while also testifying to a traumatic experience that was both deeply personal and collectively felt. Often, the graffiti was scratched and etched into the walls with mixtures of food, clay, plaster, and bodily fluids; regular white-washing of the cell walls over the years has preserved at least five layers of graffitied plaster. I argue that the Steri constitutes a type of ‘living archive,’ as its walls hold layers of creatively reconfigured genetic and corporeal matter now nestled within the structure and fabric of the building itself. In my analysis of the graffiti, I utilize art historian Nicole R. Fleetwood’s notion of carceral aesthetics, which considers how art-making in prison is shaped and formed by the experience of penalization. While the notion of carceral aesthetics has commonly been applied to the contemporary experience of mass incarceration, my use of this framework seeks to establish currents of solidarity and shared experience between imprisoned individuals throughout history.

N2  - This essay examines the monstrous first as a figure haunting Western legal history, stripped of rights and often merging with the animal, and second, as a divergent sociality borne of emergencies, crises, and faultlines of late liberal governmentality. In particular I ask how the figure of the pathological and violent gang member structures debates about the US‐Mexico border crosser, and the limits of humanity before the law. The essay moves from a genealogy of the gang member in Honduras, to the refugee asylum seeker of 2018, to ask what forms of difference‐making, in the form of new monstrosities, might inform new notions of kinship and solidarity amid anthropocenic futures.

N2  - For all its history of intersecting empires, the Balkans has been rarely framed as a global site of race and coloniality. This, as Piro Rexhepi argues in White Enclosures is not surprising, given the perception of the Balkans as colorblind and raceless, a project that spans post-Ottoman racial formations, transverses Socialist modernity and is negotiated anew in the process of postsocialist Euro-Atlantic integration. Connecting severed colonial histories from the vantage point of body politic, Rexhepi turns to the borderland zones of the Balkans to trace past and present geopolitical attempts of walling whiteness. From efforts to straighten the sexualities of post-Ottoman Muslim subjects, to Yugoslav nonaligned solidarities between Muslims of the second and third world, to Roma displacement and contemporary emergence of refugee carceral technologies along the Balkan Route, Rexhepi points not only to the epistemic erasures that maintain the fantasy of whiteness but also to the disruption emanating from the solidarities between queer- and transpeople that fold the Balkans back into global efforts to resist the politics of racial capitalism.

N2  - The category of the post-human is, in much contemporary cultural theory, celebrated for marking a liberatory break from the limits of the human body. The post-human is seen, through the grafting of new bio-technologies, as enunciating a range of enhanced corporeal experiences and emancipatory possibilities. In this essay, I complicate the category of the post-human by locating it in the context of Australia's Refugee Detention Centres. In this context, in which refugees and asylum seekers are unjustly imprisoned and disenfranchised of fundamental human rights, the underside of Eurocentric conceptualisations of the post-human emerges. I proceed to identify and name the violent production of this subaltern subject as the event-trauma of the carceral post-human.

N2  - In All of Us or None, Monisha Das Gupta tells the story of contemporary antideportation organizing in the United States by migrants and refugees labeled as criminal aliens. These activists, who live daily with criminalization, work against forms of deportation that Das Gupta calls settler carcerality—the United States’ use of deportation to exert territorial control in the face of Indigenous self-determination. Drawing on fieldwork with antideportation organizing groups in New York, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Honolulu, Das Gupta documents the inventive methods of struggle against settler carcerality. Das Gupta shows how the organizers’ actions and visions depart from the settler colonial nature of the mainstream demands for a pathway to citizenship and civil rights. Through direct action, storytelling, political education, and youth and queer leadership, these organizations and collectives conceptualize an abolitionist vision of migration justice that rejects the settler state and encompasses all those who are disavowed. By highlighting this work, Das Gupta demonstrates the transformative promise offered by a dissident migrant-led politics working toward dismantling settler structures and logics.

N2  - This thesis seeks to understand the origins, development, and consequences of the carceral turn in American public education. Specifically, it considers how and why New York City came to deploy a vast force of police officers and security personnel, install sophisticated surveillance equipment, and put into place a set of highly punitive disciplinary policies that govern student behavior. Drawing from more than 40 different archives as well as 20 original oral histories, it maintains that school policing and student discipline have historically served as tools of social control and racial dominance, emerging with the very founding of organized education in America, and expanding most rapidly and dramatically as a direct response to the prospect of desegregated schooling and the attendant rupture in American life. In the wake of this conflict, the carceral apparatus was not only linked with, but institutionalized into, the public education system. Opposition to school desegregation, panic over the issue of juvenile delinquency, and white fears of Black criminality were mutually constitutive and jointly reinforcing - coming to a head in the mid-twentieth century and continuing to build upon each other throughout the ensuing decades towards a comprehensive system in the schools of exclusion, punishment, and arrest. On the level of both individual institutions and the education system as a whole, as more Black students enrolled in schools and flipped the demographics from predominantly white to predominantly Black, city and school officials increasingly met even ordinary student problems with carceral responses. City schools instituted sweeping disciplinary policies, forged partnerships with the municipal police department, and created security forces of their own as part of a larger system of student criminalization that both reflected and exacerbated existing social and racial hierarchies, stifled student organizing, and expanded the reach and power of the carceral state.

N2  - This article examines Canada’s immigration and detention system through its newly established alternatives to detention (ATD) program. As a program that relies rather extensively on mobile carceral technologies such as electronic monitoring and voice reporting, I argue that we should consider these alternatives not only as extensions of carceral apparatuses and the detention system but as pervasive, far-reaching, and more abstract manifestations of control and confinement. I introduce the term “techno-carcerality” to theorize how we might understand the shift from traditional modes of confinement to less traditional ones, grounded in mobile, electronic, and digital technologies. I contend that the use of mobile carceral technologies in the context of immigration and detention imposes physical, psychological, spatial, and data-driven modes of control and confinement in private, public, and digital space, which are veiled behind notions and misconceptions of increased freedom, mobility, and autonomy. While the ATD program may offer some better options than those available within detention centers or other carceral institutions, it is a program that involves immense surveillance dataveillance techniques that lead to profound carceral effects and anxieties, affecting everyday life in ways that experientially mimic and transcend conventional confinement.

N2  - This paper focuses on surveillance technologies that New York City landlords have been installing in low-income, public, and affordable tenant housing over the last decade. It looks at how new forms of biometric and facial recognition-based landlord technology automate gentrification and carcerality, reproducing racist systems of recognition and displacement. We offer these systems a genealogy and geography, looking at intersections of zoning, gentrification, eviction, and policing that have historically solidified to dispossess and incarcerate tenants of color. Additionally, this paper addresses how and why New York City has emerged as the world’s epicenter of “landlord tech,” mapping out several decades of urban datafication that have rendered low-income, nonwhite majority housing complexes as laboratories for surveillance experimentations today. We observe how processes of “catching” tenants for lease violations automate a longer history of racist surveillance and property-making. Yet we also highlight tenant-led resistance that has successfully thwarted facial recognition deployment and that continues to organize for landlord tech abolition today. Through affective organizing, grounded relationality, and alliance-building, tenants have created vital abolitionist space and knowledge to curb landlord technologies and the carceral logics they encode.

N2  - Contrary to commonsense understandings of torture as a form of information-gathering, confessions elicited through the use of torture produce notoriously unreliable data, and most interrogation experts oppose it as a result. With a focus on the US carceral regime in the War on Terror, this article explores the social relations and structures of feelings that make torture and other seemingly ineffective and absurd carceral practices possible and desirable as technologies of security. While much of international relations scholarship has focused on the ways in which affective and material economies of Orientalism are central to representations of the ‘terrorist’ threat, this article connects the carceral violences in the racialized lawfare against Muslimified people and spaces to the capture and enslavement of Africans and the concomitant production of the figure of the Black body as the site of enslaveability and openness to gratuitous violence. The article further explores how these carceral security practices are not simply rooted in racial–sexual logics of Blackness, but themselves constitute key sites and technologies of gendered and sexualized race-making in this era of ‘post-racial triumph’ (HoSang and LaBennett, 2012: 5).

N2  - Arguably we speak now of living in a 'carceral age' more so than ever before. Yet how does this carcerality manifest directly into individual lives on the outside of carceral spaces? If the carceral should not be solely conceptualized in terms of its anchorage to the prison, then how do aspects of carcerality subsume the private space of the offender's home? What effect do these aspects have upon offenders and their routines and behaviours, family and friends? A critical appraisal of carcerality demonstrates how diverse scholarly conversations have become when conceptualizing the notion of the 'carceral'. The presence, proliferation and expansion of electronic monitoring (EM) is an appropriate example of the way in which the normative nature of the carceral age has taken shape in the West. EM manifests as an explicit symbol of punishment for the individual while they remain within their home and community, one node of the "great carceral network" which we are embedded within (Foucault, [1977]/1995: 298), and a notion which is already explicitly discussed in literature addressing community sanctions, penalties, and alternatives to confinement. However, there exists a greater exploration of how EM, as one tool of the carceral regime, literally and legitimately territorializes spaces in the community to monitor offender compliance and its violations. A fuller discussion must be had in terms of how EM takes place-not only through its protocols and procedures (whether they be directly controlled through government or contracted out to the private sector, the latter being the case of G4S Scotland), but also through its manifestation in the physical residence of the offender. Drawing upon ethnographic observations and qualitative interviews with inmates, this study contends that EM should be geographically contextualized as a form of 'carceral territory'. This apt frame of reference examines how the inscription of punishment upon the personal territories, routines and lifestyles of inmates and their loved ones takes place, and queries how carceral territory further spreads the carceral out into society, permeating the homes and residences of those it seeks to monitor and punish. The capacity of research to provide understanding, give voice to unheard populations, and to even evoke positive social change demonstrates the need for continued 'carceral work'. By inviting the respondents to speak of their struggles and movements between the prison and the community, this research attempts to give voice to unheard populations of society while attempting to comprehend experiences of the 'carceral' and the 'territorial' more effectively. Taken together, this study crystallize a more capacious conception of how carceral territories are created, sustained, and perpetuated in the spaces and places of everyday life.

N2  - The reemergence of immigration imprisonment in the US is investigated to determine how such methods of incarceration are associated with governing globalized locations & are differentiated from 19th- & 20th-century perceptions of prison functions. Review of immigration imprisonment's resurgence during the 1980s indicates that criminal noncitizens & refugees were primarily targeted. Implications of increased Caribbean immigration, constitutional problems raised by such incarceration, & unsatisfactory facilities & conditions of US service processing centers are examined. A case study of immigration imprisonment in Miami, FL, discusses how Cuban & Haitian immigrants are treated differently; whereas Cuban immigrants were generally accepted into the US, Haitian refugees were deemed dangerous & rejected. A historical overview of incarceration's interaction with law, medicine, & government reveals that it is a seminal (& essentially racist) component of democracy, nationalism, rationality, & modernity. 54 References.

N2  - This article offers a critical genealogy of the neoliberal-carceral state by engaging the writing of Black Liberation Army member Assata Shakur. Shakur's work is read as a black feminist theorization of neoliberalism at the very moment of its emergence. By engaging Shakur's discussion of race, gender, time, and the market, the article pursues a connection between chattel slavery and the present that has yet to garner attention among scholars: slavery's haunting possession of neoliberalism. Although slavery's antiblack technologies inhabit and structure the prison, they also live on in the operations of the market. In particular, this article examines the relationship between the carceral, the market, the body, and population to consider how the necropolitics of slavery possess and drive the biopolitics of neoliberalism. The author argues that under neoliberalism, the market not only colludes with the prison, but also mimics it. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] Reprinted by permission of Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Between the town where I grew up and the nearest city lay Powick Hospital – one of the large Victorian county asylums, built in 1852. English composer Edward Elgar sometimes conducted the asylum orchestra. In 1968, World in Action filmed the first of a new genre of documentaries, exposing on national television its shocking inner workings and appalling treatment of elderly female patients (Ward F13; Nairn, 1968). It was not even filmed undercover; the hospital superintendent felt the public should be outraged over conditions in hospitals like his. Yet Powick was still operational when I was born in the early 1980s. It closed in 1989; its patients dispersed into ‘the community’, its buildings and vast grounds redeveloped as high-end residential accommodation. As teenagers we wondered who would wish to live there, among the ghosts. The story of Powick Hospital mirrors that of almost the entire network of Victorian asylums, and symbolizes the post-carceral narrative of transition from hospitals to homes. As Figure 4.1 shows, the post-carceral era saw a dramatic decline in hospital beds for ‘mental illness’, ‘geriatric’ patients and people with intellectual disabilities: over 200,000 in 1955 dwindled to fewer than 20,000 in 2020.

N2  - “What We Got to Say” examines a political period in hip-hop history during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This dissertation was partly inspired by contemporaneous examples of systemic oppression inside the criminal justice system as well as racial hostility that developed out of a series of police officer-involved shootings. It was in large part inspired by an intellectual curiosity to explore the connection between the failures of the modern civil rights movement and the politization of hip-hop. It argues that a hip-hop social movement emerged in this period to protest Ronald Reagan’s expansion of the criminal justice system: the War on Drugs. The use of hip-hop culture, public rhetoric, and mass media as evidence was guided by a “new social movement” theoretical framework that emerged in the early-to-mid 1980s. The goal was to reimagine hip-hop-generated political activism during the height of the War on Drugs through the prism social movement theory to determine hip-hop’s function as a Black sociopolitical struggle. The hip-hop social movement consisted of cultural productions in rap, politicized hip-hop films, anti-state critiques in rap journalism, and sociopolitical statements that hip-hop activists made in the mass-media. They produced political critiques that condemned hyper-social surveillance, extraordinary scrutiny, militarized policing, as well as mass incarceration. In doing so, the examined participants effectively placed the government, crime politics, and the criminal justice system on proverbial trial. The main points of this dissertation include the carceral state and how it plagued Black life in the post-civil rights era. Hip-hop-generated activism that nationalized the destruction of a racialized carceral state. Also, hip-hop activists that consisted of rappers such as Public Enemy, KRS-ONE, NAS, Ice-T, N.W.A., and 2Pac Shakur; filmmakers like Spike Lee, John Singleton, and Albert and Allen Hughes; as well as a handful of hip-hop journalists that emerged in the late 1980s. The dissertation shows that a group of racially conscious and political culturalists used the hip-hop cultural movement, evolving technology, and a newfound access to major record distribution centers and mass media platforms to wage a national protest.

N2  - Mobilities research is now an established field of academic enquiry (Faulconbridge
and Hui, 2016). In the decade since the publication of two seminal papers that
positioned mobilities as ‘centre stage’ in social science research agendas (Sheller
and Urry, 2006: 208; Hannam et al., 2006), a proliferation of wide-ranging work
on the politics underscoring the movements of people and objects has emerged. As
is well documented elsewhere (Adey et al., 2014; Cresswell and Merriman, 2011),
this has ranged from a study of technologies of motion (airplanes, trains, buses,
cars, and bicycles) to the infrastructures that enable/disable mobility (roads, rails,
airports, data centres); the subjects made mobile or immobile by regimes of regulation and control (including commuters, tourists, migrants, military personnel,
and so on); and the materialities that shape and are shaped by mobilities (food
distribution, fossil fuels, passports, and so forth). What ‘mobilities thinking’ has
come to achieve, therefore, is a critical consideration of a world that is ever ‘on the
move’ (Cresswell, 2006). But with the ‘maturity’ (Faulconbridge and Hui, 2016: 8)
of the ‘mobilities paradigm’ (Sheller and Urry 2006: 207), how might the study
of mobilities move forwards? For Faulconbridge and Hui, the future of mobilities research relies on the study of movement – and the politics of movement –
remaining ‘vibrant, creative and generative’ (2016: 1). It relies on a recognition
that ‘mobilities research is itself on the move’; drawing in new spaces, subjects,
events, occurrences, and temporalities to examine through a mobilities framework
(Falconbridge and Hui, 2016: 1). This movement, we argue, has motioned scholars
towards the study of carceral mobilities.

N2  - This thesis is about the transportation of European, Indigenous and non-white immigrant convicts to islands off the coast of Australia. It argues that carceral islands were defined not by isolation but by connection. They were part of local, colonial and imperial networks through which people, goods and ideas travelled. Through these connections, carceral islands played a key role in the colonisation of the vast Australian mainland. They acted as sites to remove those who resisted conquest or disrupted settler economies and then convict labour was re-utilised to benefit the colonial project. Using prison records and colonial office correspondence as its primary source material, it shows that islands were systematically used within the Australian convict system to isolate and extract labour from convicts. The study turns on three case studies – Melville Island (Yermalnear) in the Northern Territory, Rottnest Island (Wadjemup) in Western Australia and Cockatoo Island (Wa-rea-mah) in New South Wales – to demonstrate that carceral islands were vital for the success of colonisation. The first two chapters focus on how officials and magistrates ‘imagined’ these islands as secure, bounded ‘natural prisons’, which they used as destinations for absconders and Indigenous peoples who they deemed to be ‘escape risks’. The second half focusses on how convicts experienced island geographies in their everyday life, examining how proximity to the sea shaped the labour regimes convicts underwent, particularly building maritime infrastructure, and the forms of agency convicts undertook, particularly how they used access to sailors and the sea to smuggle and escape. Collectively the chapters show that islands were ‘differentiated spaces’ that served punitive and economic roles within the broader convict system.

N2  - Institutionalisation has played a key role in Irish social policy, however there is still a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the governing structures (government departments, medical and education regulators etc.) and those who ran the institutions, such as the Catholic convent institutions for ‘fallen’ women. Specifically a question remains as to the precise logic for transferring girls and women into these settings. This paper expands the debate by exploring the existence of Catholic Convent industries in Ireland through the lenses of spiritual eugenics in the early 20th Century. In contrast to Anglo‐American eugenic practices based on sterilisation and birth control, Latin eugenic practices accepted by the Catholic Church were based on removing women from temptation and may have produced a necessary commitment to long‐term closed institutions. The paper offers a brief description of the differences between eugenics aimed at biological fitness and the practices aimed at spiritual promotion.

N2  - Despite a notable increase in scholarship on the causes and consequences of wrongful convictions, there remains considerable room for growth in research on the carceral experiences of the wrongfully convicted. In addition to enduring the "pains of imprisonment" that all incarcerated persons experience, wrongfully convicted persons encounter distinctive prison-related traumas, they face additional social difficulties that stem from being innocent in carceral spaces, and they encounter unique reentry challenges. In this chapter, we review and synthesize existing literature on wrongfully convicted persons' experiences of imprisonment and reentry, and we identify gaps in the current body of literature on these experiences. We conclude with a discussion of policies and programs that may assist exonerees in their recovery following their wrongful conviction and imprisonment.

N2  - This chapter argues that throughout The Mars Room (2018), Rachel Kushner interrogates the (predominantly white, male) environmental literary tradition and suggests that the notion of "nature-as-freedom" demands radical revision in the age of petro-capitalism. In the novel, set in a California women's prison, Kushner argues that environmental destruction and carcerality are both constitutive parts of the same capitalist matrix, and to escape one arena of domination is merely to enter another. Contemporary "crime petro-fictions" like Kushner's, I contend, demonstrate the ideological limitations of the inherited American environmental literary tradition while illuminating the striking convergences between carceral and ecological disaster in a world circumscribed by carceral petro-capitalism.

N2  - This dissertation traces the rise of digitally-driven policing technologies in order to make sense of how prevailing logics of governance are transformed by ubiquitous computing technology. Beginning in the early 1990s, police departments and theorists began to rely on increasingly detailed sets of metrics to evaluate performance. The adoption of digital technology to streamline quantitative evaluation coincided with a steep decline in measured crime that served as a proof-of-concept for the effectivity of digital police surveillance and analytics systems. During the turbulent first two decades of the 21 st century, such digital technologies were increasingly associated with reform projects designed to improve the transparency and accountability of police departments. This dissertation challenges that assertion, and argues that digitization functions to make “numerical” and “mathematical” racial and sexual violence that is internal to policing neoliberal political economy. Rather than transparency and accountability, this dissertation posits that the effect of digitally-driven police technology is the accelerative disentangling of the “human” from “life” and “life” from government. The consequence has been the ossification of a racialized carceral state under the aegis of putatively anti-racist technocratic governance.

N2  - Drumming is an ancient nonverbal communication modality for expression of emotion. However, there has been limited exploration of its possible applications in clinical settings. Further, the underlying neural systems engaged during live communication with drumming have not been identified. We investigated the neural response to live, natural communication of emotion via drumming using a novel dual-brain neuroimaging paradigm to discover its unique neurophysiological mechanisms related to drum behavior and cross-brain coherence, and as compared to talking. We then investigated the application of a drumming intervention in an incarcerated, halfway house population to characterize intervention feasibility, elucidate the phenomenology of social and emotional effects of group drumming, and identify its possible benefits for treatment engagement and community reintegration. For neural response investigation, hemodynamic signals were acquired using whole-head functional near infrared spectroscopy. Dyads of 36 subjects participated in two conditions, drumming and talking, alternating between “sending” (drumming or talking to partner) and “receiving” (listening to partner) in response to emotionally salient images from the International Affective Picture System. Results indicated that increased frequency and amplitude of drum strikes was behaviorally correlated with higher arousal and lower valence measures, and neurally correlated with temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activation in the listener. Contrast comparisons of drumming greater than talking also revealed neural activity in right TPJ. For the interventional investigation, a group drumming program was implemented once a week for eight weeks for incarcerated participants in a halfway house. Twenty-eight participants were randomized to either the drum group or treatment as usual. Interviews and a focus group were conducted to assess the experienced benefits of the group drumming intervention, and halfway house retention rates were compared across groups. Retention rate was significantly higher in the drum group than in the treatment as usual group. Qualitative analysis elicited three themes: group drumming 1) functions therapeutically as a method of coping with difficulty, 2) offers opportunity for connection through building relationship and experiencing communion in a setting where isolation is the norm, and 3) provides an environment for personal growth, particularly toward re-humanization and self-empowerment. Neural findings suggest that emotional content communicated by drumming engages right TPJ mechanisms in an emotionally and behaviorally sensitive fashion; interventional findings suggest significant therapeutic potential in social and emotional domains that can have quantifiable impact on recovery process. Together, findings suggest that drumming may provide access to neural mechanisms with known sensitivity to social and emotional conditions that facilitates therapeutic aims. Informed by this research, drumming may provide novel, effective clinical approaches for treating social-emotional psychopathology.

Yet from photography in the nineteenth century to AI-enhanced tracking cameras today, there is a long history of prisons being used as a testing ground for technologies that are later adopted by the general public. If we recognize the prison as a central site for the development of media technologies, how might that change our understanding of both media systems and carceral systems? Prison Media foregrounds the ways in which the prison is a model space for the control and transmission of information, a place where media is produced, and a medium in its own right. Examining the relationship between media and prison architecture, as surveillance and communication technologies are literally built into the facilities, this study also considers the ways in which prisoners themselves often do hard labor as media workers—labor that contributes in direct and indirect ways to the latest technologies developed and sold by multinational corporations like Amazon. There is a fine line between ankle monitors and Fitbits, and Prison Media helps us make sense of today's carceral society.

N2  - From the foreclosure crisis of 2008, to the tech boom-provoked housing crisis currently engulfing the San Francisco Bay Area, low-income residents of Oakland, California have been displaced from their homes at an alarming rate over the past decade. In this piece I draw from Gloria Anzaldúa’s Borderlands and engage with Black geographic thought, urban and sound studies to build a borderlands analytic. I consider how the “tension, ambivalence and unrest” of the borderlands provides a lens to understand the volatility of cities gripped by rapid gentrification. Using a borderlands analytic to make sense of the borders that are produced and policed in gentrifying cities, I consider how Black and Latinx life has been criminalized spatially and sonically so as to be displaced by forces of racial capitalist extraction. To do this, I look to the implementation of gang injunction zones in Oakland in 2010, and then to two moments in 2015 when the city’s soundscapes were policed and criminalized. This piece centers the Black and Latinx geographies experiencing dispossession in Oakland, and considers how residents are imagining and fighting for their city’s future.

N2  - Research and reform strategies aimed at fighting for justice in women’s prisons brought much-needed attention to the neglected role of gender in relation to mass incarceration. However, my research on California “gender-responsive” prison policies and my organizing with incarcerated survivors of violence resulted in striking conclusions. Although gender-based violence and discrimination are pervasive in US prisons, particular gender-identity reforms seeking legal redress within liberal rights-based rubrics, fail to adequately address the problems articulated by people in women’s prisons. Paradoxically, good-intentioned advocates exacerbate suffering by proposing dangerous policies (e.g. sterilization) and because the state appropriates demands for gender reforms in ways that expand repressive prison apparatuses and lead to racialized and gendered carceral violence against both imprisoned people and the communities they leave behind. This project tracks the study of gender and criminality and women’s prison reform and critiques problematic mobilizations of gender and/or the plight of women prisoners. I identify commonalties shared by less-successful strategies, posit explanations for what the strategies neglect, and suggest alternatives to advocate for all prisoners. This search reflects my extended grappling with one primary question—following the lead of prisoners—what type of research and reform strategies address the deleterious conditions of confinement inside US prisons and jails, without expanding the reach of the carceral state further into communities targeted for debilitation? I assess gender-identity based reforms in women’s prisons by emphasizing the interconnectedness of gender oppression and racializing assemblages in relation to carceral violence and state power. For example, I place the state’s criminalization of abused women’s resistance to violence in relation to the global processes that fuel prison expansion. Similarly, I examine how the prison, as an institutional site of disciplinary power and a mechanism of racialized population management, relies upon gendered violence (and resistance to it) as a primary means to maintain marginalized communities in a state of debilitation. I anchor counter-narratives in theorizing by prisoners, abolitionists/activists, critical prison, race, and theory scholars and feminists in gender studies, black studies, humanities, and law. I call upon “traditions of the oppressed” to ground punishment technologies in relation to (and extensions of) histories of the transatlantic slave trade/racial slavery, settler colonialism, and indigenous genocide. The purpose of my project is to unravel the logics that legitimize the place of prison in society, to “build communities, not prisons,” and ultimately, to challenge any notion that prisons make us safe or that people should be locked in cages period.

I had been doing research on the retail industry and had spent several months prior working as a frontline employee and interviewing other entry-level workers. I knew going into the project that retail jobs are deeply insecure, riddled with low wages and erratic schedules; a growing portion of retail workers are categorized as “involuntary part-time,” meaning they seek full-time work but are unable to find it.

N2  - This thesis spanning creative writing, criminology and architecture examines some of the ways power and hierarchies can be explored and exploited in space. It is a practice-led study in two parts: one primarily critical (A Circular Argument) and the other primarily creative, in the form of a novel (The Out). The main focus of the critical piece is the obsession with the circular as an architectural gesture and as a concept combining containment and transparency, from the ideal planned city of the Middle Ages, via Bentham's panopticon, to the all-seeing eye of modern digital society. The creative piece explores how the complications and surprises of human interaction are bound to colour and change the supposedly watertight systems of social control we design as a society - how prison architecture or national road networks might be undermined, or how the power dynamics of the class system might be temporarily suspended in a heightened situation. Forgiveness, desistance and redemption also play a part in the narrative, for both the 'guilty' and 'innocent' parties. Both elements of the thesis also examine how time moves differently inside from outside of the prison walls, and the limited success of trying to build away social problems. Methodologically speaking, the work follows certain key features of practice-led research, where the creative outcome constitutes the research in and of itself, rather than existing as a conduit for pre-existing research conclusions. The practice-led approach prioritises the making process, in dialogue with a theoretical framework, although this may not always be visible in the finished work. Again there are hierarchies at play here, in an epistemological sense, in how knowledge is created, viewed, accessed and consumed. In this sense, the thesis takes a deliberately outward-looking approach in terms of intended readership, aiming to sit alongside works of fiction as comfortably as academic texts. On several levels, the work inhabits grey areas and liminal spaces - between the three academic disciplines across which it is situated, between critical and creative approaches, and between multiple social and spatial hierarchies. This liminality has come to be reflected within the work through exploring non-places, in an explicit sense in the critical work, and implicitly in the creative work - from the limbo of the motorway service station, to the carceral dead space exploited by the prison architect and his escapee. I found the in-between spaces, and indeed their opposing poles, to hold an inherent friction which ultimately proved to be creatively generative.

N2  - COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in correctional institutions across the world, and many jurisdictions have taken emergency measures, such as the temporary release of some incarcerated individuals, to combat the pandemic. Such emergency measures are necessary and appropriate. However, the pandemic is an opportunity to tackle more long-standing and difficult questions about mass incarcerations and punitive systems in countries such as the United States, England, and Wales, where fair treatment of incarcerated persons is historically low. In this chapter, we show that social and health inequalities, infection control, and minimal access to information and information technology (IT) have plagued prisons for decades behind closed doors and the COVID-19 pandemic has served to highlight these inequalities to the public. Finally, we posit that the pandemic is an opportunity to rethink the purpose of prisons and whether they can be justified for the incarceration of people who are vulnerable by virtue of their poor health, age, or other social injustices. The COVID-19 pandemic crisis provides the impetus to retheorize the purpose of prisons; refocus efforts on institutional correctional practices that are rehabilitative, progressive, and streamlined; and provide foundational footing for praxis. If approached equitably and ethically, such reform could also address the disparate treatment of marginalized populations.

This chapter examines that social and health inequalities, infection control, and minimal access to information and information technology (IT) have plagued prisons for decades behind closed doors and the COVID-19 pandemic has served to highlight these inequalities to the public. It considers social and health inequalities within the prison population. Pre-COVID, recommendations regarding prisons' preparedness for a pandemic have included clear and thoroughly prepared communication to prison staff, people in prison, and society. This should consist of information regarding what each of these groups can expect and should be honest about the issues faced and decisions made, while simultaneously minimizing panic and social unrest within the closed institution.

N2  - This theoretically based thesis employs a critical feminist analysis to examine the gendered aspects inherent in the implementation of private property on Indigenous reserve land in Canada. Although Indigenous peoples in Canada have previously rejected privatization of their reserve lands for fear of assimilation of their traditional lands to market-based commodification and rationalities, as well as fragmentation and reduction of their traditional land base, versions of privatization policies continue to be advocated by some government officials, think tanks, scholars, and a small but significant number of Indigenous peoples themselves. With the Canadian governmental shifts to neoliberal socioeconomic policies converging, in some ways, with Indigenous demands for more self-determination, it is foreseeable that both the anxiety and appeal of privatization of Indigenous reserve lands will resurface. Recent advocates of privatization of reserve lands present it as necessary for unlocking the market value of dead capital in land leading to investment certainty thereby unleashing an entrepreneurial "spirit" leading to prosperity. The neoliberal ideological linkage of private property to purportedly emancipatory entrepreneurialism is depoliticized from historical and ongoing gendered and racial colonialism. Settler colonial dispossession of Indigenous women from their traditional relationships to land and labour, coupled with current growing expectations of women as participants in entrepreneurialism, has inspired the main question of the thesis as: How does the contemporary rationalization of private property for First Nations reserve land operate as a gendered tool of dispossession for Indigenous women? To answer this question, this thesis uses an interdisciplinary socio-political lens to interrogate the First Nations Private Property Ownership Act (FNPOA) as a contemporary example of Indigenous land privatization policy. It is argued that the logic underlying the policy, including entrepreneurialism as dependent on private property, along with gender-blind historical revisionism, operates to erase and obscure not only the historical colonial dispossession of Indigenous women but also the current carceral mechanisms in capitalism that work to maintain the heteropatriarchal settler state status quo. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary framework drawing on Indigenous feminist theory and carceral geography, historicizing historical and anthropological research to elucidate how past dispossession is still operational in the contemporary state. This critical feminist analysis unsettles the common sense of private property and contributes to feminist engagement with settler colonial studies.

But the inordinate amount of resources that have gone into designing, developing, and deploying these technologies cannot be explained by the engineering laws of Gordon Moore or Mark Kryder.¹ The flight of industrial capital, racialized deproletarianization, social struggle, the crime and drug wars, and the rise of information capital each played a role in triggering the criminal justice system’s multi-billion-dollar digital metamorphosis. Since the final quarter of the twentieth century, northern industrial cities have undergone a slow and uneven shift

N2  - In November 2014, the Chicago Housing Authority approved a pilot program to allow a limited number of individuals with criminal records to live in their housing programs. In this article, I contend that the pilot provides an important opportunity to institutionally recognize and extend material benefits to formerly incarcerated individuals for whom housing is both especially difficult to secure and especially important to find. Drawing on Wacquant, I argue that the pilot also offers an opening for key institutions of urban governance, such as housing authorities, to acknowledge their own role in perpetuating a pervasive “carceral continuum” that disciplines the urban poor and feeds mass incarceration. However, drawing on interviews with pilot organizers and participants, I show how the pilot responds to and replicates pervasive fears of crime that link poverty and criminality in particular. As a result, its cautious experimental design relegates participants to the status of test cases and exceptions, rather than normalizing their presence in public housing. The pilot further relies on a problematic and paradoxical understanding of “return” that obscures public housing’s historical role in the carceral continuum. In all of these ways, the logics of this pilot and others like it remain limited, thus undermining their potential to disrupt such carceral continuities.

N2  - This article situates the (human) body as a signifier for society at large, arguing that developments in many societies of structural and systematic violence that targets minorities such as refugees and first nation peoples, points to a failure of democratic values. Using two examples, we elaborate technology and digital devices as prosthesis of the body, that are also acting as proxy for state violence. The first example is from the carceral archipelago of Manus Island as a site of remote detention of refugees carried out by the Australian government. Refugees held on Manus Island describe the treatment they experience as torture. The second example is drawn from the Australian mainland, telling the stories of First Nations children subjected to abuse and violence in juvenile detention centers. A judicial inquiry (Royal Commission) found that a systematic approach aimed at punishing children constituted torture. The concepts developed in this article are those of bordering and racialization, while the intertwining of human and '' more than human life '' helps to understand and challenge the necropolitical power evident in (liberal) capitalism.

N2  - In this article, we argue that modes of labour and value extraction have been under-researched and under-theorised in critical geographical research on migration, asylum and refugee humanitarianism. We examine data production, voluntary work programmes and financialised asylum housing as key sites through which value is extracted from asylum-seekers’ unpaid and reproductive activities. We argue that specific forms of migrant carcerality are, firstly, grounded in migrants’ and asylum-seekers’ carceral conditions and exclusion from paid work. Secondly, we argue that subtle forms of coercion and conditionality at work in asylum hosting require asylum-seekers’ invisible and unpaid labour. Thirdly, we show how financialised real estate firms further capitalise on government contracts for asylum housing, rendering accommodation as another site of value extraction. We thereby expand conceptualisations of carceral economies of migration control beyond detention and confinement and elaborate the specific forms of labour and value extraction emerging from migration, asylum and refugee governance.

N2  - Cultural geographers have long been interested in “the everyday,” but rarely is everyday life acknowledged in the context of incarceration. In Canada, the recent adoption of “tough-on-crime” policies has meant that increasing numbers of individuals spend their daily lives behind bars. In this dissertation, I ask: what do prisons sound like, and what is the role of sound in the way prisons are managed, conceptualised, and embodied? The recent flourishing of scholarship on carceral geographies has made crucial inroads in the study of the cultural politics and spatialities of incarceration, yet the notion of incarceration as a multi-sensory, embodied experience remains under-researched.Drawing on Feld’s notion of acoustemologies, or auditory knowledges, I argue that one way to better understand the production of carceral space is through engagement with sonic techniques, histories, and materialities of prisons. Thinking about sound as a tangible and intangible force, I show how different conceptualisations of sound – including silence, noise, and music – (re)shape power relations in Canada’s prisons. In the midst of overcrowding and segregation in prisons, Canada’s political climate reverberates through its carceral soundscapes, leaving lasting soundprints on incarcerated bodies. Alongside these authoritative and often oppressive uses of sound, I articulate how sonic tactics have also been employed to reclaim dignity and resist pains of imprisonment (Sykes, 1958).To address how the everyday is negotiated sonically in prisons, I draw on situated narratives of individuals who have visited, worked, and lived inside prisons, recognising the experiences of people whose voices are often silenced in prison literature. This research employed a wide range of methods, including interviewing, blog analyses, archival research, and auditory techniques to investigate multi-sensory accounts of carceral life. Bearing in mind the political nature of access to Canadian prison environments, I urge researchers to explore the potential for sonic methods to navigate these challenges, to produce geographical and (trans)carceral knowledge, and to imagine alternatives to current practices of incarceration. I conclude with a call to consider more critically the role of listening in future research, as an instrumental route to empathy and reconciliation.

I am interested in affect as cognitive and unconscious responses to signification, as well as the affective impact of ideological apparatuses, material/economic structures, and technology.² Drawing on theoretical discussions of affect in relation to interest, debt, animacy, and the posthuman, I consider the

N2  - With the conflation of sex work and sex trafficking has emerged the narrative that criminalizing participants in the sex trades can abate sex trafficking; this belief has been enacted through policing the most visible spaces of the industry. The conflation of sex work with sex trafficking has produced an emerging consensus that trafficking can be abated by criminalizing participants in the most visible spaces of the sex industry. These regulations in the US have produced uneven geographies of inclusion and exclusion, which disproportionately affect queer and trans sex workers of color. The physical suppression of sex work propagated the use of digital platforms, which grant workers more agency in navigating their experiences both on and offline. However, the SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act)-FOSTA (Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act) threaten these platforms by holding them accountable for any sex work-related content. By framing SESTA-FOSTA as an extension of previous regulations that hyper-police queer and racialized individuals, this chapter explores how the legislation reconfigures the virtual and physical geographies that workers occupy, as well as perpetuates geographies of exclusion by erasing spaces for knowledge sharing and community building. The chapter concludes by speculating on the transformative potential of the sex workers' rights-based movements to manifest more equitable and just futurities.
This chapter focuses on sociologist Elizbeth Bernstein's conception of carceral feminism-a faction of feminism that seeks punitive, rather than redistributive, solution to gendered violence and inequities-to understand how anti-sex trafficking discourse has influenced the spatial regulation of sex work. However, the agency offered by digital platforms is now threatened by Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA)-Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which passed in April 2018. Prostitution Free Zones are particularly illustrative of how spatial governmentality manifests carceral feminism in the built environment. Proponents have argued the internet has dramatically shifted the scale of both sex work and sex trafficking; thus, their support for SESTA-FOSTA is based on the belief that trafficking will be curtailed by shutting down avenues for commercial sex. The digital restrictions imposed by SESTA-FOSTA emulate previous policies seeking to restrict or eliminate sex work from specified areas.

N2  - This dissertation explores how a supposed natural prison became a national park in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Combining methods and literatures from history, geography, political ecology, comparative literature, and science and technology studies, it tells the story of prison and place at “the end of the world.” The Ushuaia Penal Colony, referred to as the “Argentine Siberia,” operated from roughly 1902-1947. Using this austral prison as a case study, this work offers an environmental history of incarceration, what I call a “carceral ecology.” Ushuaia was a hybrid modern penitentiary-penal colony that was not confined to its stone walls, and bridged institutions such as modern and pre-modern carceral forms. Prison engineers spoke back from Latin America to foreign experts by offering an “open-door” incarceration method in response to failed penitentiary systems throughout Europe and the United States. This method brought together forestry and incarceration sciences, and also brought foreign experts to this distant outpost. Inmate labor and rehabilitation was centered on a sub-Antarctic timber industry, and therefore the prison and forestry department were co-constitutive through resource management and a transatlantic economy. When a military coup took the Argentine capital in 1930, political prisoners were exiled to Ushuaia where they refashioned their nationalist visions based on their confinement to incorporate Patagonia into a modern Argentina. Finally, this project follows the transition from the closing of the prison in 1947 to creation of sites of national memory. In 1960, the forests once labored by inmates were conserved as a national park, and various parties placed Argentine national history within a longer natural history. This work ends by exploring how national memory is shaped in order to preserve or elide socio-environmental relationships.

N2  - Aims
To identify implementation barriers and facilitators to the adoption and implementation of programs that provide opioid agonist treatments (OAT) with methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder in jails and prisons in the United States.
Design
Qualitative analysis: semi‐structured interviews were conducted and thematic analyses of transcripts and notes were performed using a hybrid inductive/deductive coding approach.
Setting
Jails and prisons in the United States.
Participants
From August 2019 to January 2020, we conducted 20 key informant interviews with 35 individuals representing 19 carceral systems that both initiate and maintain OAT.
Measurements
Interviews covered four domains: (1) program adoption; (2) policy influence on implementation; (3) program structure; and (4) program outcomes.
Findings
Stigma among staff, particularly medical staff, challenged program adoption, but reduced over time as staff were exposed to the program. Regulations on OAT dispensation, such as licensing requirements and prescribing limits, were key challenges to program implementation and shaped program structure. Dispensing medication required significant staff, time and space. Facilities were further challenged to overcome stigma and concerns about diversion, as OAT medication is often treated as contraband in carceral settings. Some systems deviated from evidence‐based treatment by limiting OAT dosage to low levels, requiring counseling for participation and requiring detoxification before medication initiation. Despite these challenges, early adopters felt strongly that other jails and prisons in the United States should provide OAT and that legislation and litigation may soon force OAT expansion in these carceral settings.
Conclusions
Despite identifying regulatory and logistical challenges, early adopters of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) programs in US jails and prisons demonstrate that OAT programs can successfully be implemented in carceral settings with tailoring to the specific context.

N2  - The Snake Pit(1946), written by Mary Jane Ward, became one of the most famous accounts of mental hospitals of the mid-twentieth century. In her semiautobiographical book, which became a best seller, Ward drew from her own experience within a system in the midst of great change. Yet even as mental hospitals adopted advances and procedures from psychiatry, Ward portrayed the asylum above all as a site of incarceration.
Born in 1905 to a white upper-class family in Indiana, Ward married statistician and playwright Edward Quayle and lived in Chicago and then Greenwich Village. Soon after moving to New York,

N2  - “The most effective technology,” observes urban theorist Nigel Thrift, “is what becomes adopted as infrastructure.”¹ Writer Tsutomu Nihei takes this assertion to the extreme in a manga where urban governance is fully automated, performed by a computer program designed to optimize the city’s core functions. The program ultimately decided that in maximizing the use of city resources, it was best to remove humans from the equation. It achieved this through massive machines that were originally designed to manage infrastructure. The machines were reprogrammed to banish humans from the urban core, which they achieved by digging an artificial canyon, forcing people

N2  - The commercial surrogacy industry in India administers in a way where the women working as surrogate mothers live in surrogate houses. It is a space deliberately designed and run by either the fertility clinics or a third-party agency, where the surrogate mothers are required to stay for the entire gestation period. The surrogacy industry in India utilizes the vulnerability of couples who do not or cannot have children, in order to prepare valuable and docile bodies which can serve as a platform for accumulation of wealth. This paper draws from an ethnographic inquiry of the surrogate housing facilities functioning in two cities in India: Anand and Bengaluru. The paper will argue that the surrogacy industry in India produces geographies of carceral domesticity by deploying disciplining apparatuses governing the day-to-day mundane activities of the reproductive laborers. The medical experts often resort to the narrative that these women cannot be trusted with the safety of the babies they carry, hence, justifying their confinement in the surrogate house. Further, the possibility that the surrogate mothers may develop emotional attachments to the babies they carry, which in turn, will endanger the surrogacy arrangements, also runs through such narratives of regulation.

N2  - Following recent events involving racism and violence in policing, the current study sought to understand factors associated with support for related social movements and worries about personal, family, and peer safety. Data were from 78 currently incarcerated young people (
M
 = 16.5 years; 31% Black) and 20 juvenile prison staff (
M
 = 40.3 years; 72% Black) via online surveys. A comparable proportion of young people (47.3%) and staff (47.4%) reported participating in the Black Lives Matter movement. Among young people, prior experiences with police were significantly associated with support for social movements and worries about safety concerning racism and violence in policing. Among staff, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and racial and ethnic identity were significantly associated with social movement support and worries about safety. Civic education and interventions to promote racial and ethnic identity may promote support for systemic change and buffer against worries about racism and violence in policing.

N2  - For this review I sought to understand how the field of education has come to conceptualize and study the relationship between schools and prisons. In doing so, I found that the vast majority of scholars who have studied the relationship(s) between school and prisons have done so within the context of the
school to prison pipeline
conceptual framework. This review both explores the affordances and contributions of the school to prison pipeline framework, as well as some of the limitations and critiques of the framework when used as the most preeminent frame by which we understand and study the ties between schools and prisons. I examine these limitations by focusing on four principal areas of study within the school to prison pipeline literature: (1) school discipline policies and practices, (2) school-police partnerships, (3) surveillance technologies in schools, and (4) disproportionality. The broader aim of this review is to develop the way we conceptualize the relationships between schools and prisons by building on what we have already learned in using the STPP framework, while also exploring new ways of theorizing and empirically studying the growing relations between schools and prisons.

N2  - Dominant metanarratives of prison escape—as rebellion in the name of freedom and as spectacular revelation of prison organizational failure—stand in stark contrast to the experience and meaning of escape for those for whom it matters most: prisoners. For prisoners, escape does not necessarily constitute a line of flight out of the space and time of punishment. Instead, it abruptly transforms their relationship to state power and communal belonging that more often than not reifies the isolation that incarceration insists upon. Guided by a prisoner’s narrative of escape from a Guatemalan prison, evasion, exile, and re-capture, this essay brings the phenomenon of prison escape into conversation with carceral geography’s exploration of essential connections and reflections between the prison and other social, institutional and geographic spaces, highlighting how multiple actors and forces beyond the carceral state collude in fixing vulnerable bodies in place . Ultimately, the freedom that escape might promise the prisoner recedes before discourses and infrastructures of punishment and isolation built far beyond the prison, showing how incarceration and freedom cannot be defined by prison walls, nor by the law’s calculations that pretend to mete out justice in discrete units of time.

N2  - This chapter explores how trains and steamboats—the iconic engines of mobility, freedom, and transcontinental connection—also served nativist designs as the new technology for mobile captivity and national expulsion. Situated between the intersection of settler economy and rapid industrialization, the chapter’s transnational exploration of deportation trains dissects the private–public partnership between state agencies and the Southern Pacific Railroad. This partnership first detained and deported Chinese immigrants in the American West, and from that experience a “hybrid public–private space” was created as an engine of deportability that affirmed national border control through rapid locomotion. After being detained, the state placed Chinese and Mexican noncitizens aboard train cars where moving segregation and speedy expulsion ensured locomotive border control. This chapter argues that historians must adopt a “mobility turn” that moves beyond the permanence of fixed carceral structures and institutions to adopt a more transnational view where the coerced and confined dislocation of people is bound to the blur of carceral motion.

N2  - Correctional facilities house millions of residents in communities throughout the United States. Such congregate settings are critical for national infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts. Carceral settings can be sites where infectious diseases are detected in patient populations who may not otherwise have access to health care services, and as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, where outbreaks of infectious diseases may result in spread to residents, correctional staff, and the community at large. Correctional IPC, while sharing commonalities with IPC in other settings, is unique programmatically and operationally. In this article, we identify common challenges with correctional IPC program implementation and recommend action steps for advancing correctional IPC as a national public health priority.

N2  - Transportation has been identified as one of the major barriers to successful reentry for prisoners released to community in the United States. We foregrounded transportation and mobility in our design consistent with the new mobilities paradigm and investigated the mobility needs of returning citizens from the perspective of service providers and employers in Dallas, Texas. We interviewed 17 participants who directly served returning citizens in their professional roles as part of a conventional content analytic design that focused specifically on transportation and mobility among their clients. The findings include five primary themes: 1) Returning citizens rely primarily on public transit; 2) Access to cars is rare, complicated, but advantageous; 3) Support lays a road to successful reentry; 4) Transportation is critical for successful reentry, and; 5) Returning citizens face a complex network of obligations. We utilized mobilities literature and assemblage thinking to interpret our findings as an expansion of the carceral mobilities literature both conceptually and geo-spatially as a reentry mobility assemblage. The paper concludes with a consideration of the possibilities for social service practice, research, and pedagogy through a mobilities lens.

N2  - Within a landscape, boundaries are the physically or socially defined lines that mark the limits of spaces. They can appear static and binary, and therefore analytically restricted. Yet it is argued here that while space is often analyzed in archaeology to inform social, economic, or institutional interpretations of a landscape, the analysis of boundaries is a complimentary method that captures movement, control, and prohibition mechanisms. Analyzing boundaries is shown to reveal aspects of change – sometimes diachronic and sometimes ephemeral – and a malleability that is often linked to materiality. The examination of the early nineteenth-century historical boundaries of Point Puer, a juvenile convict prison (1834–49) located in lutruwita/Tasmania, Australia, is used as a case study to illustrate their common archaeological forms. It is reasoned that the analysis of boundaries contributes dynamic interpretations of historical landscapes by theorizing boundaries as spatial frameworks to examine social and experiential elements of space.

N2  - The story often told about HIV in South Africa is a celebratory one that foregrounds the relationship between seropositive citizens and health‐care institutions. In the last 20 years, the government has invested heavily in rolling out life‐sustaining antiretroviral medicines to all who need them, making HIV a firm ground upon which many residents claim protections from the state. This article explores the role of medicine in buttressing the carceral state. I propose
biocarceral citizenship
to characterize the way health‐care entitlements produce new relationships to the criminal legal system, not through active state surveillance but by extending the responsibilization expected of patients to the penal sphere. Drawing from 22 months of ethnographic research carried out in clinics and courtrooms in the town of Thohoyandou between 2014 and 2018, I apply this concept to both those who have experienced rape, for whom reporting to the (carceral) state is a condition of accessing HIV prophylaxis, and to those who are charged with rape, for whom adherence to antiretroviral medicines is used as evidence of weaponizing sickness. In parallel ways, therapeutic responsibilization exposes both groups to state violence. The article takes HIV‐related entitlements as a cipher for theorizing punishment beyond a critique of neoliberalism.
La historia que se cuenta a menudo acerca del VIH en Sudáfrica es una de celebración que destaca la relación entre ciudadanos seropositivo e instituciones del cuidado de la salud. En los últimos 20 años, el gobierno ha invertido considerablemente en dar a conocer medicinas anti‐retrovirales que sostienen la vida a todos los que las necesitan, haciendo VIH una base firme sobre la cual muchos residentes reclaman protecciones del estado. Este artículo explora el rol de la medicina en reforzar el estado carcelario. Propongo la
ciudadanía biocarcelaria
para caracterizar la forma en que los derechos del cuidado de la salud producen nuevas relaciones al sistema legal criminal, no a través de una vigilancia activa del estado sino extendiendo la responsabilización esperada de pacientes a la esfera penal. Basado en 22 meses de investigación etnográfica llevada a cabo en clínicas y salas de audiencias en el pueblo de Thohoyandou entre 2014 y 2018, aplico este concepto tanto a aquellos que han experimentado asalto sexual, para quienes reportar al estado (carcelario) es una condición para acceder a la profilaxis del VIH, como a aquellos quienes están acusados de asalto sexual, para quienes la adhesión a las medicinas antirretrovirales es usada como evidencia de convertir una enfermedad en un arma. En formas paralelas, la responsabilización terapéutica expone a ambos grupos a la violencia del estado. El artículo toma los beneficios relacionados con VIH como un código para teorizar el castigo más allá de una crítica al neoliberalismo.

N2  - How should society respond to police surveillance technologies? This question has been at the center of national debates around facial recognition, predictive policing, and digital tracking technologies. It is a debate that has divided activists, law enforcement officials, and academics and will be a central question for years to come as police surveillance technology grows in scale and scope. Do you trust police to use the technology without regulation? Do you ban surveillance technology as a manifestation of discriminatory carceral power that cannot be reformed? Can you regulate police surveillance with a combination of technocratic rules, policies, audits, and legal reforms? This Article explores the taxonomy of past approaches to policing technologies and-finding them all lacking-offers the "tyrant test" as an alternative.
The tyrant test focuses on power. Because surveillance technology offers government a new power to monitor and control citizens, the response must check that power. The question is how, and the answer is to assume the worst. Power will be abused, and constraints must work backwards from that cynical starting point. The tyrant test requires institutional checks that decenter government power into overlapping community institutions with real authority and enforceable individual rights.
The tyrant test borrows its structure from an existing legal framework also designed to address the rise of a potentially tyrannical power-the U.S. Constitution and, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment. Fearful of a centralized federal government with privacy invading intentions, the Fourth Amendment-as metaphor and methodology-offers a guide to approaching surveillance; it allows some technologies but only within a self-reinforcing system of structural checks and balances with power centered in opposition to government. The fear of tyrannical power motivated the original Fourth Amendment and still offers lessons for how society should address the growth of powerful, new surveillance technologies.

N2  - A shift in crime analysis software used by municipal police departments in the US is currently underway from simpler predictive models to criminal ‘risk’ forecasting that uses data not specific to crime to direct police to areas with ‘environmental risk factors’ such as bars, transit stops and mental health facilities. Through analyses of interviews with developers, industry professionals and law enforcement as well as published statements, this article offers a detailed examination of how the function and premises of ‘data-driven’ policing are altered by this turn to epistemologies of risk. I argue that the latent presence of ‘disorder’ supplements visible aberrations of ‘order.’ Statistical indeterminacies are called upon to justify a range of police interventions, and a focus on arenas of contagion supplements the spatial logic of containment. These turns reveal that the paradigm of ‘risk’ participates in the cooptation by technocratic reform of critiques exposing the problematic geographies of policing. I therefore suggest a shift away from critique oriented by revealing spatial bias in purported objectivity and towards interventions in the operationalization of indeterminacy itself and the vision of public life that undergirds and is enacted by this software.

N2  - Drawing from Foucault's methodological terms of archaeology and genealogy this article critically engages with understanding the inter-relationship between old age and prison life.We draw out the relevance of a Foucauldian paradigm for investigating how penal discourses and actual prisoners experiences exemplify issues of power, knowledge and surveillance in institutional settings. We draw out how violence impinges on the lives of older people in prisons by pointing out the implications of such experiences for both a critical ontology and epistemology of ageing. It is by transgressing the boundaries of the conventional understanding of the prison and by casting a critical gaze that will gain greater understanding of how elder abuse in secure settings goes unregulated.

N2  - Sitting between the psychiatric and criminal justice systems, and yet fully located in neither, forensic psychiatric units are complex spaces. Both a therapeutic landscape and a carceral space, forensic services must try to balance the demands of therapy and security, or recovery and risk, within the confines of a strictly controlled institutional space. This article draws on qualitative material collected in a large forensic psychiatric unit in the UK, comprising 20 staff interviews and 20 photo production interviews with patients. We use John Law’s ‘modes of ordering’ to explore how the materials, relations and spaces are mobilised in everyday processes of living and working on the unit. We identify two ‘modes of ordering’: ‘keeping safe’, which we argue tends towards empty, stultified and static spaces; and ‘keep progressing’ which instead requires filling, enriching and ingraining spaces. We discuss ways in which tensions between these modes of ordering are resolved in the unit, noting a spatial hierarchy which prioritises ‘keeping safe’, thus limiting the institutional capacity for engendering progress and change. The empirical material is discussed in relation to the institutional and carceral geography literatures with a particular focus on mobilities.

N2  - This perspectives paper critically examines the concept of reskilling within the context of a prison garden program, challenging deficit-based narratives that assume incarcerated individuals lack agricultural knowledge. Drawing on six years of experience in a college-in-prison program and insights from a sustainable food systems practicum, the paper explores how asset-based approaches better recognize and amplify the skills, creativity, and resilience of incarcerated students. By reimagining agricultural education as a reciprocal exchange rather than a one-directional intervention, and incarcerated people as contributors to food system change, this paper argues for a more inclusive, equitable approach to food systems transformation that values the lived experiences of all participants.

N2  - AbstractPatients in custody due to arrest or incarceration are a vulnerable population that present a unique ethical and logistical challenge for emergency physicians (EPs). People incarcerated in the United States have a constitutional right to health care. When caring for these patients, EPs must balance their ethical obligations to the patient with security and safety concerns. They should refer to their institutional policy for guidance and their local, state, and federal laws, when applicable. Hospital legal counsel and risk management also can be helpful resources. EPs should communicate early and openly with law enforcement personnel to ensure security and emergency department staff safety is maintained while meeting the patient's medical needs. Physicians should consider the least restrictive restraints necessary to ensure security while allowing for medical evaluation and treatment. They should also protect patient privacy as much as possible within departmental constraints, promote the patient's autonomous medical decision‐making, and be mindful of ways that medical information could interact with the legal system.

N2  - Bureaucracy, the governing legacy of the expanse of European colonialism, has come to be the dominating means by which states relate to their citizens; also through which they relate to other states. Analysing geographies of evil from within a post-colonial world system perspective, it becomes possible to see the creation of carceral geographies - literal prison states - created to control and manage populations inconvenient to or unwanted by the state. Deemed always already criminal, the unwanted are submitted to the technologies of control that have come to be associated most closely with the prison - with checkpoints, with constant suspicion that they are planning some malevolent behaviour, forbidden from entering certain areas of the state, forced to prove their own innocence in the face of presumed guilt, and often literally caged in by geographies designed to recreate the architecture of the prison. I contend that such systems are capable of being upheld through the banality of bureaucracy. The purpose of this piece is to first attempt a deconstruction of the notion of a banal bureaucracy and its role in the creation and maintenance of carceral geographies, and second to add to the growing literature on anthropology of the state through incorporated comparisons between individual carceral circumstances and a wider capitalist pattern of power.

N2  - Tracing the rise of digital computing in policing and punishment and its harmful impact on criminalized communities of color
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that law enforcement agencies have access to more than 100 million names stored in criminal history databases. In some cities, 80 percent of the black male population is registered in these databases.Digitize and Punish explores the long history of digital computing and criminal justice, revealing how big tech, computer scientists, university researchers, and state actors have digitized carceral governance over the past forty years-with devastating impact on poor communities of color.
Providing a comprehensive study of the use of digital technology in American criminal justice, Brian Jefferson shows how the technology has expanded the wars on crime and drugs, enabling our current state of mass incarceration and further entrenching the nation's racialized policing and punishment. After examining how the criminal justice system conceptualized the benefits of computers to surveil criminalized populations, Jefferson focuses on New York City and Chicago to provide a grounded account of the deployment of digital computing in urban police departments.
By highlighting the intersection of policing and punishment with big data and web technology-resulting in the development of the criminal justice system's latest tool, crime data centers-Digitize and Punish makes clear the extent to which digital technologies have transformed and intensified the nature of carceral power.

N2  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic forced prisons into extended lockdowns, people-in-prison have been increasingly reliant on remote access technologies such as videoconferencing to interact with the outside world from their carceral context. During the pandemic, both corrective services and criminal courts found that these communication technologies could adequately facilitate court appearances, legal conferencing, health services and visitations. Now, despite the lessening panic regarding COVID-19, there are suggestions that authorities are keen to continue, if not increase, the usage of video links meaning that people-in-prison will experience decreasing human contact. The argument is that COVID-19 "successes" are being used as an excuse to cement remote hearings and visits. This points to a future of absolute confinement uninterrupted by "inconvenient" physical court attendance or human visitors. This article will focus on the "digital vulnerability" of people-in-prison, that is, the intersection between the vulnerabilities of incarcerated people with the use of remote communication technologies such as videoconferencing or video links, and the digital inequalities that may be provoked or solved. The article will draw on qualitative research - fieldwork interviews with judicial officers, lawyers and associated criminal justice professionals - that reveal critical perspectives on the impacts of digital transformation on vulnerable people-inprison. For instance, when asked about the vulnerabilities of people-in-prison, one defence lawyer (DL1) expressed the view that "no one cares about defendants" or their vulnerabilities, nor their abilities to engage with video links, comprehend or play any role in their own remote legal matters. We analyse our source materials through a framework of vulnerability theory and the developing concept of digital vulnerability. In this way, we seek to offer new knowledge regarding prison digital transformation, specifically the relationship between digital technologies in correctional environments and the vulnerable incarcerated population.

N2  - Over 10 million individuals pass through U.S. detention centers on an annual basis, with nearly two-thirds meeting criteria for drug dependence/abuse. Despite proven efficacy, treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is underutilized in jail settings—a gap that could be addressed using telemedicine. Here we describe a new program of telemedicine-based clinical provision of new/continuing buprenorphine treatment for individuals detained in a rural jail. Implementation objectives were completed between January and August 2020, and patient encounters were conducted between August 2020 and February 2021. We established (i) telemedicine hardware/software capability; (ii) a screening process; (iii) buprenorphine administration methods; (iv) necessary medical release procedures; (v) telemedicine encounter coordination and medication prescription procedures; and (vi) a research platform. Seven incarcerated patients have been treated, two of whom were referred from community treatment. Patients were mostly male (71%), non-Hispanic White (86%), and averaged 33 years old. All patients tested positive for an opioid upon intake and began/continued buprenorphine treatment in the jail. Average time to first MOUD appointment was 9 days and patients were maintained in treatment an average 21 days. Referrals for continuing community treatment were offered to all patients prior to discharge. We report successful implementation of telemedicine MOUD in a rural detention center, with treatment engagement and initiation occurring prior to the high-risk period of discharge. The fact that this program was launched during the height of the pandemic highlights the flexibility of telemedicine-based buprenorphine treatment. Challenges and obstacles to implementation of buprenorphine treatment in a correctional system are discussed.

N2  - Rising rates of female incarceration within the United States are incompatible with the lack of federal standards outlining the rights of incarcerated mothers and their children. A robust body of evidence demonstrates that prison nurseries, programmes designed for mothers to keep their infants under their care during detainment or incarceration, provide essential and beneficial care that could not otherwise be achieved within the current carceral infrastructure. These benefits include facilitation of breastfeeding, bonding during a critical period of child development, and decreased recidivism rates for participants. Legal precedent exists to support the rights of the mother to continue to parent their child but remains in stark opposition to current prison infrastructure that could allow them to do so. Existing state policies also have inconsistent mechanisms for determining child eligibility and should move to centre decision-making on a case-by-case basis. This work will demonstrate that a just society, supported by law and ensuring maternal-child welfare supports the establishment of prison nursery programmes as a part of the existing right to healthcare for incarcerated individuals.

N2  - Imprisonment may sometimes be a justified form of punishment. Yet the U.S. carceral system suffers from appalling problems of justice—in who is put into prisons, in how imprisoned people are treated, and in downstream personal and community health impacts. Medical personnel working in prisons and jails take on risky work for highly vulnerable and underserved patients. They are to be lauded for their professional commitments. Yet at the same time, prison care undercuts the ability of medical personnel to uphold their own professional standards and sometimes fails in even basic health protection. Doctors in prisons are stuck between their commitment to vulnerable patients and complicity in a system that requires their participation to uphold its constitutionality. Medical ethics is frayed in prisons, and the problem deserves our attention.

N2  - This article explores Foucault's two different notions of power: one where the subject is constituted by power-knowledge relations and another that emphasizes how power is a central feature of human action. By drawing out these two conceptualizations of power, Foucault's work contributes three critical points to the formation of medicalized subjectivities: (1) the issue of medicalization needs to be discussed both in terms of both specific practices and holistically (within the carceral archipelago); (2) we need to think how we as human beings are "disciplined" and "subjectivated" through medicalization, as discourses, practices, and institutions are all crystallizations of power relations; and (3) we need to reflect on how we can "resist" this process of subjectification, since "power comes from below" and patients shape themselves through "technologies of the self." Ultimately, Foucault's work does not merely assist us in refining our analysis; rather, it is essential for conceptualizing medicalization in contemporary society.

N2  - The expansion and diffusion of the 'carceral state' - understood here as the set of institutional configurations and actors that prioritise punishment, containment, detention, and/or incarceration as a means of treating poverty and marginalisation - is a looming contemporary concern. It seems probable that confluent interests from the commercial, governmental, and civil society sectors will, in the absence of robust interrogation, continue to extend the scope of penal supervision in the lives and communities of already marginalised people. Drawing upon a wide range of literature our chapter critically queries the pairing of punishment and the marketisation of criminal justice. For example, is the extension of electronic monitoring simply a convenient use of a handy technology? Or does it involve the inadequately examined delegation of the state's power to punish? We call into question the troubling relationship between claims of market-as-accountability versus democratic decision-making. By questioning the interpenetration of these interests, our intention is to re-ignite public conversation concerning the legitimacy of current penal developments and to call attention to some alternative paths.

N2  - Globally, sex workers have highlighted the harms that accompany anti-prostitution efforts advanced via anti-trafficking policy, and there is a growing body of social science research that has emerged documenting how anti-trafficking efforts contribute to carceral and sexual humanitarian interventions. Yet mounting evidence on the harms of anti-trafficking policies has done little to quell the passage of more laws, including policies aimed at stopping sexual exploitation facilitated by technology. The 2018 passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the corresponding Senate bill, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), is a case study in how efforts to curb sexual exploitation online actually heighten vulnerabilities for the people they purport to protect. Drawing on 34 months of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with sex workers and trafficked persons (n = 58) and key informants (n = 20) in New York and Los Angeles, we analyze FOSTA/SESTA and its harmful effects as a launchpad to more broadly explore how technology, criminalization, shifting governance arrangements, and conservative moralities cohere to exacerbate sex workers’ vulnerability.

N2  - Sleep is an underexplored factor in the health of people involved in the criminal legal system. This study addresses the paucity of research on how individual, social, and physical environmental factors impact sleep health during and after incarceration by highlighting the voices of people involved in the criminal legal system through a community-engaged qualitative research approach.
We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with men recently released from prison for a study on trauma and healthcare during incarceration and after release. Interviews were coded and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis and a critical realist framework. Our research team included people with a history of incarceration who performed central roles in the research process.
Three themes emerged from participants' descriptions of sleep during and after incarceration: (1) concerns about health contributing to sleep problems, (2) lack of access to treatment for sleep disorders leading to ongoing sleep problems, and (3) issues of safety contributing to sleep problems during incarceration and after release.
This study identifies factors and domains influencing sleep during and after incarceration. By identifying which interpersonal, environmental, and structural factors impact sleep quality, medical and carceral staff are better equipped to ameliorate sleep health disparities within populations with a history of incarceration and those actively bound by the criminal legal system. Future research should examine other factors impacting sleep in incarcerated and recently released populations and develop multi-level interventions to improve sleep health. This paper is part of the Sleep and Circadian Health in the Justice System Collection.

N2  - State reactions to Black Lives Matter demonstrations include heavily militarized domestic police responses and the deployment of the National Guard. These events place emphasis on understanding the U.S. military as an institution and militarization as a process; as well as their corresponding environmental justice (EJ) consequences. In this study, we integrate critical race theory, decolonial thought, carceral geography, and military and environmental sociology to theorize the military and militarization as potentially important and overlooked sources of environmental injustice that ought to concern scholars and activists. We use an interdisciplinary framework to highlight: the historical role of the military in the creation and maintenance of racialized and colonized difference, how the U.S. militarization is connected to localized and national overpolicing and environmental harm, and how the environmental risks of warfare may be transferred from combat zones to civilian EJ communities and sites, both domestically and abroad. We stress that the production of colonized and racialized space—and the criminalization of Black, Indigenous, and other bodies of color—happens within the context of militarization as a process and the U.S. military as an institution so future critical analysis should look to these levels. Our goal is to urge scholars and activists to recognize the military as a potentially significant contributor to environmental injustice and outline avenues for future study.

N2  - In the United States, Black cultural production is bound up with geographic containment, restrictions on mobility, and racial segregation. Jazz, hip-hop, house music, and the Minneapolis Sound (the music associated with late recording artist, Prince) were mid-wifed by some of the most repressive systems of geographic order. Indeed, containment and creativity, geographies of trouble and hope are hallmarks of Black cultural production. This dialectic calls into question the belief that art can only be created in conducive or untroubled spaces. Hip-hop provides a perfect case study to challenge this assumption. Born in the Bronx, NY in the early 1970’s, hip-hop was a cultural movement that emerged in against the backdrop of racial and economic segregation, mass incarceration, and joblessness. Yet, hop-hop “danced its way of these constrictions” and created geographies of hope. In doing this, hip-hop shows that Black cultural production and the radical imagination from which it springs, have the capacity to create counter-spatial imaginaries that challenge those under which it was produced. To that end, this article addresses the relationship between creativity and containment. Through linking the rise of carceral power, racially restrictive housing practices, a deindustrializing economy, and expanding prison populations with the hip-hop, I demonstrate the dialectic between systematic spatial containment of poor and working-class Black and Latinx Americans and the role it played in creation of the world’s most powerful cultural force.

N2  - The United States prison system, the largest in the world, operates through both exploitative and rehabilitative modes of discipline. To gain political and public support for the extensive resources expended housing, feeding, and controlling its incarcerated population, the carceral state strategically emphasizes a mix of each mode. Agriculture in prisons is particularly illustrative. With roots in racial capitalism and the carceral state’s criminalization of poverty, plantation convict leasing system, work reform efforts, and punitive and welfarist carceral logics, prison agriculture embodies explicit forms of exploitation and claims of rehabilitation. Accordingly, this article contextualizes and explains results from a nationwide study of state prisons within our framework of the
disciplinary matrix
. At least 662 adult state prisons have agricultural activities, including an array of animal, food, and plant production. We find that the drivers of these activities are financial, idleness reduction, reparative, and training. Our disciplinary matrix framework departs from conventional assignments of a particular activity to one disciplinary mode or the other and recognizes that any activity may be driven by different prison needs or philosophies. We investigate how different combinations of agricultural activities and drivers rely on discourses of deservingness to naturalize and reproduce structures of racialized, classed, and gendered control inside and outside prison, as well as the legitimacy of the prison system itself.

N2  - Background
Eliminating infectious diseases epidemics requires resources for testing, prevention, and treatment in jails. The 2022 Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention guidelines recommend offering hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and STI testing at jail intake. Currently, the impact of offering testing at intake in jails has only been analyzed in the context of multi-modal strategies to increase testing. There is a lack of real-world data about the impact of offering testing at jail intake as a strategy to increase testing. In May 2022, Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts added questions to their intake form offering HIV, HCV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia testing. The goal of this project was to assess frequency of testing before and after the addition of infectious diseases testing questions to the intake form.
Case presentation
Data about infectious diseases testing completion per month were compared between February-April 2022 and May 2022-June 2023. The transition from rapid to venipuncture HIV testing was also compared between September 2021-June 2023. Data was assessed in monthly intervals. The median number of urine tests decreased from 39 to 28, and the median number of blood tests decreased from 21 to 15 after testing was offered during intake.
Conclusion
There were no significant trends in the run chart after the intervention. Although offering testing at intake is one important part of healthcare in jails, intake testing should be supported with other systems including access to phlebotomy, facilitated movement from the housing areas to the medical unit, and stigma reduction tools.

N2  - Recent nationwide racial justice uprisings following ongoing police violence against Black communities juxtaposed with the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the urgency for a reckoning around the ineffectiveness and harm caused by the carceral apparatus. It is well documented that the correctional system was founded upon and continues the legacy of slavery and white supremacy. Research has shown that incarceration directly contributes to many negative health outcomes, including increased risk and spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, especially among people who inject drugs. This high burden of HCV disproportionately impacts low-income communities of color, who not only report higher rates of substance use due to pervasive discrimination but are also over-incarcerated as a result of structural racism and the War on Drugs. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscores that correctional facilities are fundamentally structured to promote health inequities. Minoritized communities who are overrepresented in corrections continue to be put at increased risk of COVID-19 in overcrowded facilities, are isolated from social support and medical care, and have been ignored in vaccination strategies. In this perspective, we argue that HCV interventions within the carceral apparatus will remain largely ineffective due to the negative health impacts of incarceration. Instead, we propose adopting abolitionist principles for HCV elimination—divesting from the carceral apparatus to prioritize community-based efforts on promoting HCV screening, treatment, and prevention. In doing so, the nation will have not only the capacity to meaningfully eliminate HCV but also the potential to improve overall societal outcomes.

N2  - Purpose of Review
Behaviors and practices associated with substance use contribute to lack of HIV virologic suppression and onward transmission. In the USA, many recent HIV outbreaks have been connected with substance use. Evidence-based strategies for integrating care of those at risk for and living with HIV and who use substances continue to evolve. This review, based on scientific and medical literature through March 2023, provides an overview and evaluation of initiatives for integrated care aimed to serve patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use disorder.
Recent Findings
Integrated care services can improve health outcomes for patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use disorder; for instance, treatment for an opioid use disorder can help improve HIV viral suppression. Brick-and-mortar facilities can provide successful care integration with appropriate clinic leadership to support multidisciplinary care teams, up-to-date provider training, and sufficient pharmacy stock for substance use treatment. Delivering healthcare services to communities (e.g., mobile healthcare clinics and pharmacies, telehealth) may prove to be an effective way to provide integrated services for those with or at risk of HIV and substance use disorders. Incorporating technology (e.g., mobile phone applications) may facilitate integrated care. Other venues, including harm reduction programs and carceral settings, should be targets for integrated services.
Summary
Venues providing healthcare should invest in integrated care and support legislation that increases access to services related to HIV and substance use.

N2  - Overcrowding and limited ability to social distance contribute to high rates of COVID-19 outbreaks in correctional facilities. Despite the Centers for Disease Controls’ recommendations, incarcerated persons and correctional staff report a high prevalence of vaccine-hesitance. We sought to identify reasons underlying COVID-19 vaccine hesitation and refusal in correctional systems. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines to design the review. We searched PubMed abstracts and reviewed literature relevant to COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy in correctional systems of the United States (
n
 = 23). Reasons for vaccine hesitancy among incarcerated people and correctional staff include efficacy, safety concerns, lack of information, and distrust. Findings reveal higher vaccine hesitancy among young and Black residents whereas facilities in close collaborations with state health departments exhibited higher vaccination rates. Correctional facilities must prioritize communication and education to improve the current state of vaccine hesitancy.

N2  - Incarcerated people who study critical theory and emancipatory pedagogy inside prison classrooms can be frustrated by an inability to practice its goals of removing the barriers between faculty and students and creating a more just and democratic society. Inside prison, the theory of emancipatory learning is immensely empowering, but its practice is fraught by the intersecting, oppressive technologies of the prison world. In this article, three incarcerated students and two faculty who teach in prison trace how integrating restorative justice practices bridged emancipatory theory into actual practice. We demonstrate that incarcerated scholars who are equipped with restorative justice training can mitigate prison's disempowering structures.

N2  - This article reconsiders children’s mobilities through the relationship between care and control in the context of Russia’s disability orphanages. Drawing upon the lens of carceral mobilities, the article challenges the dominant conceptualisations of children’s mobilities as ‘independent’ or necessarily intertwined with notions of ‘wellbeing’. Instead this piece draws upon ethnographic research into the Russian disability orphanage system to present three typologies of multi-scalar carceral mobilities which children experience in this context; firstly as a form of spatial segregation and containment, secondly as a form of punishment and finally enforced stillness and restraint as a form of care. In doing so it provides new insights into the nature of the everyday for children in restricted institutional environments, largely absent from the wider geographical literature. Through the lens of carceral mobility this article provides a more nuanced geographical reading of the orphanage beyond an environment variously understood to harm or problematically to provide shelter, but as an institution enmeshed in biopolitical processes of power and control.

N2  - Introduction In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended for prison authorities to introduce prison needle and syringe programs (PNSP) if they have any evidence that injecting drug use is taking place in prisons. This article presents descriptive evidence that injecting drug use takes place in Ukrainian prisons, it discusses how (denial of) access to injection equipment is regulated in the current system and what changes should be considered in order to implement PNSP. Background Ukrainian prisons still live by the laws and policies adopted in the Soviet Union. Besides laws and regulations, these legacies are replicated through the organization and infrastructure of the prison's physical space, and through "carceral collectivism" as a specific form of living and behaving. Inviolability of the prison order over time helps the prison staff to normalize and routinely rationalize punishment enforcement as a power "over" prisoners, but not a power "for" achieving a specific goal. Methods The Participatory Action Research approach was used as a way of involving different actors in the study's working group and research process. The data were gathered through 160 semi-structured interviews with prison health care workers, guards, people who inject drugs (PWID) who served one or several terms and other informants. Results The "expertise" in drug use among prisoners demonstrated by prison staff tells us two things-they admit that injecting use takes place in prisons, and that the surveillance of prisoner behavior has been carried out constantly since the very beginning as a core function of control. The communal living conditions and prison collectivism may not only produce and reproduce a criminal subculture but, using the same mechanisms, produce and reproduce drug use in prison. The "political will" incorporated into prison laws and policies is essential for the revision of outdated legacies and making PNSP implementation feasible. Conclusion PNSP implementation is not just a question of having evidence of injecting drug use in the hands of prison authorities. For PNSP to be feasible in the prison environment, there is a need for specific changes to transition from one historical period and political leadership to another. And, thus, to make PNSP work requires making power work for change, and not just for reproducing the power itself.

N2  - In the United States, the proportion of criminal legal-involved (CLI) adults with a substance use disorder reaches 72%, and ~150,000 persons with HIV pass through a carceral setting annually, which represents 16% of the HIV-infected population nationally. Despite the high need for substance use treatment and HIV prevention services, few carceral settings successfully link CLI individuals to treatment upon release. Young adults represent 41.9% of the adults incarcerated in the United States and have the highest HIV incidence rates nationally. Peer patient navigation has successfully increased community-based care linkage for people living with HIV leaving jail; yet, peer-led navigation for HIV prevention among HIV-negative CLI populations is undeveloped and untested. eHealth approaches to substance use and HIV prevention services hold promise because they improve access to effective intervention services, particularly for younger people.
This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to improve linkage to substance use treatment and HIV prevention services using peer navigation and a codeveloped eHealth technology adjunct.
The three aims of this study are to (1) adapt an existing evidence-based navigator model and incorporate codeveloped eHealth technology to refer and link young adults (18 to 29 years) surveilled by the criminal legal system to substance use and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services; (2) refine and test the intervention with criminal legal-involved young adults (CLI-YAs); and (3) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the intervention. Data to inform the intervention will be collected via system partner interviews (n=4) and focus groups with CLI-YAs (n=24). Next, an open trial (n=10) will be conducted. The intervention will be refined via interviews with participants and facilitators, and a randomized pilot trial (n=75) will be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the eHealth-enhanced navigation on substance use and PrEP services linkage. Exit interviews conducted with a subsample of intervention participants (n=10), the navigator (n=1), and system partners (n=4) will assess intervention acceptability and suggestions for improvement. A community of practice, a group of system partners with an interest in working toward solutions to common problems, will inform each phase of the study.
The project is currently ongoing. The project was funded in September 2022. Internal review board approval was received on March 21, 2022. The first results from early study aims are expected to be published in 2025.
This study provides an opportunity to reduce HIV acquisition and improve access to substance use treatment in a systemically marginalized group: young CLI-YAs. The results will contribute to the development and testing of a future multilevel randomized controlled trial.

N2  - Introduction
Expanding access to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to people involved in the carceral system is a priority for the New Hampshire Department of Corrections (NHDOC), where more than 40% of residents have an opioid use disorder (OUD). NHDOC participated in the multi-site Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) clinical trial, “Long-acting buprenorphine vs. naltrexone opioid treatments in criminal justice system-involved adults (EXIT-CJS)”. We examine the contributing factors to the expansion of the NHDOC MOUD program from 2021 to 2023, including participation in EXIT-CJS, which occurred from 2019 to 2024.
Methods
Data on quarterly MOUD prescribing and EXIT-CJS enrollments were abstracted from the NHDOC medical records from July 1, 2021- December 31, 2023 as part of a quality improvement initiative. To examine factors influencing expansion of the program, conversations were conducted with NHDOC leadership team and clinical staff.
Results
From 2021 to 2023, the quarterly number of patients treated with MOUD at the NHDOC increased by more than 400% from a total of 165 patients in July-September 2021, to 685 patients in October-December 2023. At the policy level, elimination of the federal DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) Program allowed additional providers to prescribe MOUD. At the organizational level, support from NHDOC leadership, including Medical and Forensics and the Commissioner’s Office, encouraged broader engagement in MOUD from providers, multidisciplinary staff, and security. This work was augmented through receipt of State Opioid Response (SOR) dollars with a requirement to continue to advance education for NHDOC staff on the efficacy of MOUD. Resulting discussions between medical providers, experts on addiction treatment, staff and residents supported a culture change in attitudes about MOUD. During this same time window, the NHDOC made significant adjustments in the distribution of MOUD by adjusting the nursing administration process thus reducing the stigma associated with being a patient on MOUD and treating MOUD medication administration like all other medical conditions.
Discussion
Policy-related, organizational, and individual factors contributed to the expansion of the MOUD program at the NHDOC. EXIT-CJS recruitment occurred synergistically with the expansion of the MOUD program. As NHDOC was engaged as a site in EXIT-CJS, study recruitment increased awareness of extended-release treatment options among residents and staff.

N2  - This paper tracks the impact of prison transfers (and mobility considerations more generally) on the spatio-temporal regimes pursued within the British Penal Estate. I argue that what appear from outside as static spaces of detention are in fact nodes within a network deeply crisscrossed by internal patterns of mobility and the problematics of time–space coordination. I explore the power relations that shape prisoner patterns of movement and highlight the distinctive states of deprivation they generate.

N2  - Research focused on minoritized communities has predominantly been conducted by individuals associated with universities who have little connection to or investment in these communities beyond their research agenda. Oftentimes, this research benefits the researcher more than the community. This study of a peer‐taught, prison‐based, adult language, and literacy program challenged traditional research paradigms through the implementation of participatory action research (PAR). Informed by PAR epistemologies, the research team, composed of the incarcerated peer‐instructors and a university volunteer, employed qualitative methodologies over an 18‐month period to better understand how the program was experienced by its different members in relation to classroom practices and policies. We examine how PAR provided a reflexive space for us to examine our shifting subjectivities as members and researchers in the program while also challenging our understandings of the experiences of program members. Additionally, this study calls for a broader consideration of how change is defined.

N2  - New technologies for recording, reproducing, and disseminating sound are increasingly accessible and provide important opportunities for listening to accounts of confinement. Through a politics and practice of ‘earwitnessing detention’, this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By ‘tuning in’ to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of ‘indefinite stuckness’. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the ‘chaos’ outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness.

N2  - À partir d’une étude qualitative, réalisée auprès de la population carcérale dans trois maisons d’arrêt de France, nous proposons une présentation centrée sur les interactions détenus/surveillants. C’est en analysant les relations basées sur la gestion de l’espace carcéral entre ces deux groupes qu’apparaît une inégale temporalité. L’ « organisation » est proposée comme un modèle de réactivité, où le personnel de surveillance s’adapte à chaque instant à la demande des reclus. Néanmoins, nous avons souvent entendu ces derniers se plaindre du lent processus qui permet de passer de la sollicitation à la concrétisation d’une requête (changement de cellule, prise de rendez-vous chez le médecin, parloir...). Quant aux surveillants, ils ont une injonction à exécuter rapidement leurs tâches. Le surveillant, homme libre dans un espace fermé et réglementé cohabite avec le détenu, homme dépourvu de liberté : les rythmes paraissent inconciliables. Comment, dans un contexte de surpopulation latente et d’inégale temporalité, les surveillants traitent-ils les demandes des détenus ? Notre article a l’ambition de décrire ce contexte temporel complexe et d’apporter des éléments de compréhension.

N2  - As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants’ feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.

N2  - This paper engages with the digital mediation of cultural and political opinion in simulation gaming, and recent critique of cultural geography’s aptitude for research into digital media. Drawing attention to literatures within carceral geography and cybergeography, and presenting an empirical case study of the simulation computer game Prison Architect, it suggests that rather than being necessarily ephemeral, fleeting and transient, digital cultural production can also be carefully created, curated and manipulated in ways which involve both deep reflection on, and profound shaping of, political attitudes.

N2  - This article presents crucial new evidence that prisons with a higher proportion of the area within their perimeter given over to natural vegetation exhibit lower levels of self-harm and violence (both between prisoners and toward staff). Extending prior qualitative prison-level studies that find that nature contact influences prisoners' self-reported well-being, it uses geographic information systems mapping to generate a new prison greenspace data set, capturing-for a cross section of prisons in England and Wales-the percentage of greenspace within their perimeters. Econometric estimations confirm that greenspace fosters prisoner well-being, in that there are lower levels of self-harm and violence in prisons with more greenspace. These relationships are statistically robust, and they persist when we control for prison size, type, age, and level of crowding. These findings are noteworthy in that they both extend understandings of well-being in custodial environments and have the potential to significantly influence future prison design. The article also provides important new insights demonstrating links between greenspace and well-being that have significance beyond the specifics of carceral environments.

N2  - This article deconstructs a binary that has arisen between prisons as, on the one hand, 'total institutions' of exclusion and, on the other, 'carceral continuums' that incorporate marginalized urban livelihoods. The experiences of four inmates at Pademba Road, Freetown's male prison - which accommodates inmates with sentences from one year to life - illustrate that prisons belong in neither camp. Instead, inmates' unique responses to their imprisonment show that both a prison's continuity and its exclusionary mechanism are situational and gendered as crime, social standing, capital and agency coalesce. Following Michel de Certeau's examination of people's reappropriations of culture in everyday life, this article analyses how inmates' tactics to reinforce and bend prison walls work to either strengthen or undermine the carceral system's strategies and influence the prison's permeability. Inmates' embodied experiences allow for a nuanced understanding of the inside/outside relationship of imprisonment and of the space between mobility and stasis, subjugation, embrace and resistance.

N2  - This article analyzes the spatial and temporal patterning of women’s arrests for political crimes during the first period of the fascist regime in Italy from 1925 to 1927. A key element of the fascist dictatorship was the creation of the Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State. A focus on the Special Tribunal opens a window on the fascist gender political because this court focused exclusively on political crimes. Using archival data and spatio-temporal analytic techniques this research indicates a complex pattern. Women were arrested at far lower rates than men with very little spatial clustering. Also, the cases of arrested women were dismissed or transferred to the ordinary criminal courts at a much higher rate than those of their male counterparts. Overall, the Special Tribunal seems to have been more lenient with women than with men, although those women whose cases remained in the tribunal seem to have been treated much like the men in terms of sentencing and incarceration. Women and men were both subjected to long periods of surveillance after they were released from court or prison. Once arrested, both women and men might spend many years in prison, exile, or under surveillance irrespective of whether they were judged innocent or guilty. This was an important moment for Western history because this new model of society and state has been consequences also in others totalitarianism raising questions about the treatment of women in other authoritarian regimes in twentieth century Europe and beyond.

N2  - This paper uses one of Scotland's most controversial experiments in penal reform - the Barlinnie Special Unit - to examine the enfolding nature of care and control in carceral space. Connecting with recent arguments relating to "caring architecture" and using the framework of historical carceral geographies, it showcases the spatial complexities of implementing caring practices alongside reforming tactics. Beginning with a discussion of the care and control nexus within institutional spaces and its historical legacy, it considers the use of small units within the Scottish Prison System. Using the Barlinnie Special Unit as a pivot, the paper opens up the complex spatial arrangements and spatial tactics of experimental prison reform. It first examines the spatial and architectural dimensions of the Special Unit. Second, the paper focuses on issues of routine and inhabitation and the emotional uncertainty this generated for prisoners. Overall, this paper seeks to argue the importance of examining experimental spatial practices in prison reform history to highlight the interwoven spatialities of care and control in every-day institutional life.

N2  - Heat is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. People who are incarcerated are especially vulnerable to heat exposure due to demographic characteristics and their conditions of confinement. Evaluating heat exposure in prisons, and the characteristics of exposed populations and prisons, can elucidate prison‐level risk to heat exposure. We leveraged a high‐resolution air temperature data set to evaluate short and long‐term patterns of heat metrics for 1,614 prisons in the United States from 1990 to 2023. We found that the most heat‐exposed facilities and states were mostly in the Southwestern United States, while the prisons with the highest temperature anomalies from the historical record were in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Texas, and parts of the Midwest. Prisons in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and upper Midwest had the highest occurrences of days associated with an increased risk of heat‐related mortality. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual‐level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non‐white and Hispanic populations in the prisons with higher heat exposure. Lastly, we found that heat exposure was higher in prisons with any of nine facility‐level characteristics that may modify risk to heat. This study brings together distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, which would each inform unique strategies for heat‐interventions. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will have implications for who is included in fights for environmental justice.
Plain Language Summary
Heat is a direct and increasing threat to human health. People in prison are especially vulnerable to heat as an increasingly older and disabled population with limited agency over their conditions of confinement, healthcare, or access to resources to decrease heat exposure. We use an air temperature data set to measure short and long‐term patterns of various heat metrics for 1,614 prisons in the United States from 1990 to 2023. We find that the patterns of highs and lows greatly differ based on the metric of choice. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual‐level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non‐white and Hispanic populations in prisons with higher heat exposure. We also found higher temperatures are in prisons that have characteristics that can modify exposure or vulnerability to increase overall risk. Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk can each inform unique strategies for heat‐interventions in United States prisons. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will have implications for which populations and prisons are included in efforts to reduce heat risk.
Key Points
Prisons, incarcerated populations, and staff are exposed to heat and changing climates as measured through a variety of metrics
Higher temperatures are found in prison landscapes that have characteristics that can modify exposure or vulnerability, increasing overall risk
Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, can each inform unique strategies for heat‐interventions in US prisons

N2  - The Routledge International Handbook on Decolonizing Justice focuses on the growing worldwide movement aimed at decolonizing state policies and practices, and various disciplinary knowledges including criminology, social work and law. The collection of original chapters brings together cutting-edge, politically engaged work from a diverse group of writers who take as a starting point an analysis founded in a decolonizing, decolonial and/or Indigenous standpoint. Centering the perspectives of Black, First Nations and other racialized and minoritized peoples, the book makes an internationally significant contribution to the literature. The chapters include analyses of specific decolonization policies and interventions instigated by communities to enhance jurisdictional self-determination; theoretical approaches to decolonization; the importance of research and research ethics as a key foundation of the decolonization process; crucial contemporary issues including deaths in custody, state crime, reparations, and transitional justice; and critical analysis of key institutions of control, including police, courts, corrections, child protection systems and other forms of carcerality. The handbook is divided into five sections which reflect the breadth of the decolonizing literature: • Why decolonization? From the personal to the global • State terror and violence • Abolishing the carceral • Transforming and decolonizing justice • Disrupting epistemic violence This book offers a comprehensive and timely resource for activists, students, academics, and those with an interest in Indigenous studies, decolonial and post-colonial studies, criminal legal institutions and criminology. It provides critical commentary and analyses of the major issues for enhancing social justice internationally.

N2  - Notable discursive changes are afoot with respect to individuals, particularly sex trade-involved youth in the United States. Where once they may have been profiled as juvenile offenders, they are now, thanks to widespread attention to human trafficking, provisionally viewed by law enforcement and their non-state allies as potential victims of domestic minor sex trafficking, replete with traumatic pasts and turbulent family histories that authorize state intervention. This article examines how anti-trafficking policies have been discursively re-imagined to expand policing and rehabilitative interventions for youth. Drawing on in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations, it tracks the discursive sites and spaces in which criminal justice and social justice agendas have coalesced to assist youth and further assesses how attention to domestic minor sex trafficking has simultaneously authorized a multiprofessional detention-to-protection pipeline.

N2  - Metal detectors became ubiquitous throughout the United States after their use in airports during the late-1960s and early 1970s when they were installed to address hijackings. While earlier perceptions of the technology’s invasiveness prevented the metal detector’s deployment in the United States beyond jails and prisons, security officials came to identify the device as a means to address the carceral-security state’s legitimacy crises and square mass surveillance with demands for civil and political rights. Those designing and implementing the first airport security program understood hijackings as elements of global rebellions against U.S. empire and drew from policing efforts at home and abroad in their efforts to securitize airports. Officials and courts argued that the universality and objectivity of the machine that determined potential danger solely through the presence of metal removed individual police discretion and was thus race-neutral. Claims of the technology’s novelty not only obscured its carceral and counterinsurgent origins but helped propel the metal detector’s deployment to new spaces including public schools and workplaces. The metal detector reproduced existing class and racial hierarchies and strengthened police discretionary authority.

N2  - With no possibility of teaching in prisons in person because of the pandemic, a group of social justice concerned art history graduate students offered a remote learning college course for people incarcerated in a detention facility in the United States. The culturally sustaining and trauma‐sensitive course, delivered asynchronously via tablets, was a survey of contemporary art. Because of a quarantine in response to the COVID pandemic, the class had the opportunity to use technology that is new to carceral spaces. The advantages and problems will be discussed. This article will close with practical recommendations for educators seeking to provide similar programming.

N2  - Formations of Neoslavery focuses on the oral, musical, and written accounts that followed what Angela Davis describes as the historical transition from "the prison of slavery to the slavery of prison." In their exposition of the dispossessing and dehumanizing practices of prison plantations, chain gangs, and modern penitentiaries---(anti)prison writers of early Jim Crow through today challenge the instrumental liberal bourgeois narrative of progress---namely those forms of white nationalist historical memory that define the black post-Thirteenth Amendment experience as antithetical to that of chattel slavery. For the "free" black subject, the experiences of involuntary servitude, familial separation, torture, and human warehousing in post-Civil War carceral spaces have recalled the violence and degradation which dominant historiography characterizes as "peculiar" to the Middle Passage and chattel slavery. Much of the dissertation consequently incorporates a theorization of spatial agency into analysis of (anti)prison cultures and the violence of (liberal) white supremacist law. Even as the prison state erects new technologies of racial and class terror, its continued implementation of time-honored procedures of living, social, and civil death symbolizes how modern prison architectures act as mnemonic triggers, resuscitating ostensibly obsolete forms of domination and state criminality. This time-bending capacity of spatial and racial terror signifies an historical process of racial/carceral genocide that I define as the Middle Passage carceral model. My introductory chapter, "'The 'Murderous Minstrel': Leadbelly and the Specters of White Supremacy," traces key aspects of the art and life of Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly). I argue that his subjugated position under white folklorist John Lomax---and his musical rendering of his experience as a twentieth century prison slave---symbolize the precarious nature of freedom for black people as a whole after 1865. The second chapter, "Angola Prison Plantation: The Exceptional Rule of the US 'Slavery of Prison,'" focuses directly on the punitive space of Angola penitentiary itself. In discussing the testimonies and experiences of relatively anonymous prison slaves, it considers the ways in which this 18,000-acre prison plantation represents a clear-cut axis between antebellum plantation slavery and post-bellum prison slavery. Chapter Three, "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet: Beloved, the American Chain Gang, and the Middle Passage Re-Mix," argues that Morrison's account of the horrors of the chain gang represents an instance of forward haunting within a novel ostensibly fixated on the "past" ruptures of chattel slavery. Chapter Four, "Soledad Brother and Assata : Contraband Narratives From the Hole(d)s of Neoslavery," flashes forward to time of the Black Power Movement---an era that directly preceded the advent of the prison industrial complex. I show how, for Jackson and Shakur, the interdependent operation of spatial and racial violence in the modern solitary confinement cell explodes linear models of history initiating a sort of experiential time-warp whereby the present moment is invaded---in a material fashion---by the horrors of America's racial capitalist past.

N2  - This essay takes Kevin Quashie’s formulation of a black world as the summons and seeding of my engagement with Barry Jenkins’s filmic adaptation of James Baldwin’s If Beale Street Could Talk to speculate upon how a black world might be rendered in visual, multimedia, and cinematic arts. To do so, I reckon with the inherent dangers of black visuality, and of black publicness, within a carceral landscape saturated by ever more invasive, data-driven biometric technologies of surveillance and penal capture. My critical engagement with Jenkins attends to how his evasive and deconstructive cinematic experiments enact a mode of black poesis in line with Quashie’s formulation of a black world in poetry. In so doing, they undermine the constancy (and presumed transparency) of black visuality, along with its affiliated perils in a racist carceral society. Ultimately, this essay theorizes how black visual arts innovate expressive techniques, within a visual field structured by the antiblack semiotics of epidermalization and spectacularization, to render our world in everyday, living black splendor.

N2  - One of the most troubling aspects of current trends in American mass incarceration is the extent to which 'criminality' is produced within prison walls, primarily in the form of inmate–inmate or inmate–staff assaults. Most methods of prison or jail control have the adverse, and perverse, effect of increasing inmates' levels of fear, terror, and ultimately violence – with stabbings, beatings, and other types of assaults common occurrences. The design of podular 'direct supervision' jails and their accompanying philosophies of punishment aspire to change these conditions. Direct supervision features correctional officers inside each housing unit with no physical barriers impeding supervision, and is intended to create a safe, more humane, stress-free environment for both inmates and staff. This study draws on ethnographic evidence of inmate experiences with direct supervision at Douglas County Department of Corrections in Omaha, Nebraska (USA). The respondents generally do feel safe in this jail environment, for a combination of reasons, some of which are related to spatial design. Inmates identified a number of implications – gains and losses – of this more 'humane' form of incarceration in terms of power and empowerment. The study also documents the potential for inmate activism on their own behalf through this design.

N2  - Spaces of human trafficking can be perceived as "total," akin to those of the prison and the detention center, because of the intense surveillance, bodily compliance through discipline, removal of freedom, and restricted mobility they create. Although Foucault's panopticon and Goffman's related concept of the total institution have some merit in conceptualizing these situations, geographical scholarship on institutions and regimes of incarceration has advanced important critiques of prisons as total institutions, arguing among other things for the potential of incarcerated subjects to resist and express agency. Drawing on de Certeau, these arguments focus on agency that is expressed through manipulating and subverting the disciplining gaze of power in highly embodied ways. This article examines these everyday expressions of agency in the context of bars and clubs located around U.S. military bases in South Korea, where many of the female migrant laborers are trafficked entertainers. Despite the growing scholarly engagement with human trafficking, comparatively little research attends to everyday resistance and agency in such situations or what spaces of human trafficking might tell us about the nature and geography of incarceration. In response, this article advances a perspective that centers on shadow play in everyday spaces of incarceration to illuminate the operations of resistance and agency in situations of human trafficking. It also draws attention to some of the limits in understanding resistance in such situations through the models and practices of labor activism derived through a consideration of ostensibly free laborers.

N2  - Pregnancy is a critical time to provide access to substance use treatment; this is especially true among incarcerated populations, who are known to be at particularly high risk of poor health outcomes. In this integrated literature review, we (1) report what is known about the prevalence of substance use among incarcerated pregnant and postpartum populations; (2) describe substance use treatment programs and current care practices of pregnant and postpartum populations in carceral settings; and (3) explore recommendations and strategies for increasing access to substance use treatment for incarcerated pregnant and postpartum populations. A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases yielded in the retrieval of 139 articles that were assessed for inclusion. Of the retrieved articles, 33 articles met criteria for inclusion in this review. A review of the literature revealed that the understanding of substance use prevalence among pregnant incarcerated women is limited. We also found that treatment of substance use disorders among pregnant and postpartum populations is not routinely available, enhanced perinatal services are sorely needed, and substance use treatment programs are feasible with the help of community partnerships. More research is required to understand current substance use treatment initiatives and outcomes for pregnant women in prison. In addition, strategies for integrating evidence-based, substance use treatment in carceral settings is also needed. Future directions are discussed.

N2  - As dating apps continue to receive pressure from civil society, media and governments to address a range of safety concerns, technology companies have developed and deployed a spate of new safety features. Taken together, these features rely upon increased surveillance and partnerships with both technology start-up companies and law enforcement agencies proposed as responses to sexual harassment and abuse. In this article, we draw on empirical accounts of app use – and popular media reporting – to problematise commonsense assumptions about dating apps, safety, technology, policing and surveillance. Where so-called safety features involve increased surveillance and techno-carceral solutionism, there is potential to make users less safe – particularly for app users who are marginalised or stigmatised on the basis of their race, sexuality, gender, health status, employment or disability. Instead of the impetus to ‘datafy’ consent by documenting evidence of sexual transactions, or to monitor users by sharing data with police, we argue that a more effective approach to safety must extend the notion of ‘consent culture’ to encompass a consent-based approach to collecting, storing, and sharing user data – including seeking consent from users about how and whether their data is sold, monetised or shared with third parties or law enforcement.

N2  - Le VIH/sida est dans de nombreux pays un grave problème de santé pour les populations carcérales et constitue un sérieux défi pour les services pénitentiaires, les services de santé publique et les gouvernements nationaux.
Déterminer la prévalence de l’infection à VIH chez les détenus et d’en décrire les facteurs associés.
Il s’est agi d’une étude transversale à visée descriptive et analytique conduite de décembre 2015 à octobre 2016 chez 600 détenus suivis à partir d’un échantillon aléatoire, représentatif du niveau national, tiré directement à partir de la base de sondage prenant en compte l’effectif des sites dans leur exhaustivité. Des questionnaires préétablis renseignant sur les caractéristiques socio-démographiques et biologiques des détenus ont permis le recueil des données. L’analyse des données à été faite avec le logiciel SPSS 18.
L’enquête a porté sur un échantillon aléatoire de 600 détenus parmi lesquels 593 ont accepté le prélèvement de sang pour le test du VIH. La série était composée en majorité d’hommes (89 %). L’âge moyen était de 35 ans. La proportion d’enquêtés scolarisés était de 60 %, plus élevée chez les hommes. Concernant le statut matrimonial, la proportion de détenus mariés était de 51,8 %. Presque les trois quarts (71,2 %) en étaient à leur première incarcération et 51,8 % en détention préventive. Les motifs d’incarcération étaient variés dominés par l’usage de drogue (35,3 %) alors que seuls 4,6 % affirmaient continuer à s’adonner à la drogue durant leur séjour carcéral.
Parmi les détenus 97,8 % ont déjà eu une expérience sexuelle avec un âge moyen au premier rapport sexuel de 19 ans. Seuls 20,5 % des enquêtés ont déclaré avoir utilisé un préservatif lors de leur premier rapport sexuel.
Le multi-partenariat est estimé 17,8 %. La prévalence de l’infection à VIH était élevée chez les détenus (2 %) par rapport à la moyenne nationale (0,7 %). Cette prévalence était associée au sexe féminin (4,5 %) (p=0,0124), à l’âge inférieur à 35 ans (2,5 %) (p=0,346), à la non scolarisation (2,5 %) (p=0,046),au statut matrimonial de divorcés (8,7 %) (p=0,044), à l’escroquerie comme motif de détention (5,7 %) (p=0,11) et à la profession de femme de ménage (12,5 %) (p=0,002) et de commerçant (3,5 %) (p=0,29) avant l’incarcération.
Les détenus sont très vulnérables face à l’infection à VIH d’où la nécessité de mener des actions efficaces de prévention et de prise en charge en milieu carcéral.

N2  - My dissertation project studies the practice of force-feeding at Guantánamo Bay detention camp and how incarcerated individuals mobilize their bodies against indefinite confinement. Using the critical-analytical methods of feminist science and visual cultures studies, I examine force-feeding within longer histories of racially gendered subjection such as vivisection and behavior modification in order to consider how the feeding tube came to be used as an instrument of punishment on the orientalized body of Muslim men perceived to be terrorists. Through empirical research, textual interpretation, and aesthetic analysis, my dissertation intervenes in the fields of critical prison studies, and science and technology studies by foregrounding genealogies of biomedicalization and how those incarcerated reclaim corporeal agency through practices such as hunger striking. Ultimately, I argue that force-feeding is commensurate with other interrogation techniques that have become more mainstream since the Cold War, emphasizing the medicalization of war tactics and punishment. Chapter one, “Vivisectional Mandate: Behavioral Science and Torture from the Cold War to the War on Terror,” follows the ways that the Cold War’s experimentation sets the stage for the war on terror. In particular, I situate the Enhanced Interrogation Techniques of the war on terror within Cold War behavioral science in order to track the role psychology has played in the progression of biopolitical torture techniques that aim to discipline racialized bodies. The second chapter, “From Cracking the Mind to Bodily Abjection: Situating Force-Feeding in the Torture Archive,” considers how force-feeding transforms the medical clinic into a site of punitive suffering. How is this transformation linked to the emergence of biotechnologies geared towards the optimization of life in the early part of the 20th century? These questions expand outward to be considerations of patient and prisoner autonomy in the wake of right-to-die litigation and the use of the feeding tube in US domestic prisons. My third chapter, “Suspended Animation: Force-Feeding and the Visuality of Pain,” analyzes a policy manual on techniques for managing hunger striking at Guantánamo Bay detention camp alongside the visual testimonies of prisoner Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel and activist Yasiin Bey. This chapter investigates how the state frames medical ethics inside of the camps and how the emphasis placed on care obfuscates not only the demands of the prisoners but also the feeding tube as carceral technology. The fourth chapter, “Staging Incapacitation: Hunger Striking in the Wake of Force-Feeding,” considers the practice of hunger striking and self-harm at Guantánamo Bay. Here I examine prisoner’s testimonials of hunger striking and how such resistance to policies of corporeal wholeness functions as a viable form of political self-expression. By situating force-feeding practices at Guantánamo Bay into a history of medical experimentation, I reveal the inadequacies of prevailing theories of biopower, theories that are not capacious enough to account for how state sponsored torture is underwritten by the operation of Islamophobia and institutionalized racism. Tracing out an archaeology of state torture with the tools of critical prison studies and science and technology studies reveals Guantánamo Bay as neither a space of life nor death, but rather of what I refer to as suspended animation, a pointedly medicalized mode of living death.

N2  - Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential— just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.

N2  - This article considers the role of engagement with prisoners on a one-day carceral tour (prison visit) as a function of reduced prejudice and increased empathy toward offenders. Eight reflexive accounts, completed by final year criminology students approximately two weeks after interacting with convicted serious offenders, prison staff and the prison environment were thematically analysed to locate indices of prejudice and empathy toward serious offenders. Reflexive accounts were examined for content reflective of three temporal points: (i) before the visit, (ii) during the visit and (iii) after the visit. Findings demonstrated that engagement appears to have a positive influence on increased tolerance and empathy toward offenders. However, the increased empathic responding only appeared to be indicative of perspective taking and not empathic concern. Possible explanations and future research directions are discussed as well as implications for training and policy context.

N2  - The notion that prisons are a 'world apart', with their walls severing prisoners from their external relationships, and incarceration an interruption, 'time away' spent in a separate social universe, has provided an adequate framework for understanding the social realities of imprisonment in the past. But it has also created an analytical dead angle that prevents us from identifying the ramifying social effects of concentrated incarceration upon both the prison and heavily penalized lower-class neighborhoods. This article addresses these effects with data from an ethnographic revisit of a major women's prison in Portugal, where the recomposition of the inmate population that has accompanied the rapid inflation of the country's carceral population is especially pronounced and entails the activation of wide-ranging carceralized networks bringing kinship and neighborhood into the prison as well as the prison into the domestic world. The analysis focuses on the ways whereby these constellations have transformed the experience of confinement and the texture of correctional life, calling for a reconsideration of the theoretical status of the prison as a 'total institution' and for exploring anew the boundary that separates it (or not) from outside worlds.

N2  - This edited book ?explores new and enduring themes in the gendered experience of incarceration across the world. Capturing global debates and research on women's treatment, their coping and resistances in penal settings, the collection promotes a feminist agenda that is attuned to the inherently patriarchal and intersectionally oppressive structures of contemporary punishment. It seeks to map policies and campaigns around women's criminalisation across the world and offers one of the most comprehensive overviews of women's imprisonment experiences across the Global North and Global South. Each chapter focusses on a different geographic context and theme and aims to provide the intellectual groundwork for a critical, world-wide movement advocating for women's decarceration. As a whole, the collection offers a robust empirical understanding of women's punishment in non-western, Global South contexts and also revisits ongoing debates in feminist accounts of punishment in the Global North.In doing so, the collection examines hierarchical geopolitical relations between privileged and underprivileged nations, reflecting global inequalities and structural violence rooted in legacies of imperialism and colonialism. Overall, the edited collection shows how centering women's peripheralized experiences can radically reshape our understanding of punishment and offers a new intellectual, methodological, and political means through which to think about gendered identity and imprisonment in the 21st Century.

N2  - In England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the impact of humanist education, the changes of the Reformation, and the emergence of capitalism and colonialism all gave rise to an equally momentous revolution in carceral technology. This was the birth of “correction,” or the argument that punishments for minor crimes ought to go beyond retribution, and beyond deterrence, to aim at reintegrating offenders into society as well. This idea was first institutionalized in the “house of correction,” beginning in the 1550s with London’s Bridewell, which became the first prison anywhere in early modern Europe to combine short sentences with punitive work-training. By the 1630s a network of houses of correction extended across England, offering an institutional model and a culture of work discipline that could be exported, along with its convicts, to the American colonies. Objects of Correction charts the surprising extent to which imaginative literature was involved in this carceral revolution. Bridewell, the original house of correction, was located next door to Shakespeare’s indoor theater at Blackfriars—a gallery bridge connected the two—and workshops in the prison made puppets for the stage. The first English translations of More’s Utopia, with its famous ideas about penal reform, were commissioned and promoted by some of Bridewell's strongest propagandists. Milton pushed reading as a means of self-discipline, while his associates in the Hartlib Circle re-imagined houses of correction as “Literary work-houses.” Objects of Correction recast the so-called “Golden Age” entirely, by showing how English literature defined itself against the carceral institutions of its time. Working upward from the practices, institutions, philosophy, rhetoric, and even the syntax of early modern culture, Objects of Correction also offers a provocative account of "correction" itself, in the centuries before this argument became modernity’s most powerful justification for punishment.

N2  - This article explores the making of carceral citizenship in Guatemala through an ethnographic analysis of la talacha – informal prison taxation schemes. Taxation is a key technology of citizenship. Tax enforcement mechanisms, the distribution of tax burdens, citizens’ willingness to pay, and their expectations of what they should get in return all make taxation an essential lens through which to understand state formation and citizens’ perceptions of and relations with one another. In Guatemala, where organized crime competes with and subsumes state institutions in ways that profoundly impact everyone, the state is only one of many entities claiming the right to tax, at turns competing and colluding with its underworld. These blurred dynamics are hyper-distilled in the country’s prison system, where state-prisoner networks tax the imprisoned population in the name of collective survival and elite profits. Based on extended ethnographic fieldwork behind bars, I show how la talacha sets the terms of carceral citizenship by organizing prisoner-state co-governance, reifying the prison’s socioeconomic hierarchies, and shaping inmates' relation-ships with the world beyond the prison. supervivencia colectiva y los beneficios de las élites. Basándome en un extenso trabajo de campo etnográfico entre rejas, muestro cómo la talacha establece los términos de la ciudadanía carcelaria organizando el cogobierno entre presos y Estado, reificando las jerarquías socioeconómicas de la prisión y configurando las relaciones de los reclusos con el mundo más allá de la cárcel.
Este artículo explora la construcción de la ciudadanía carcelaria en Guatemala a través de un análisis etnográfico de la talacha: esquema informal de tributación carcelaria. La fiscalidad es una tecnología clave de la ciudadanía. Los mecanismos de aplicación de impuestos, la distribución de las cargas fiscales, la disposición de los ciudadanos a pagar y sus expectativas de lo que deberían obtener a cambio hacen de la fiscalidad una lente esencial a través de la cual entender la formación del Estado y las percepciones de los ciudadanos y las relaciones entre ellos. En Guatemala, donde el crimen organizado compite con las instituciones estatales y las subsume en formas que afectan profundamente a todos, el Estado es sólo una de las muchas entidades que reclaman el derecho a tributar, compitiendo y confabulando a su vez con el hampa. Estas dinámicas difusas se hiperdestilan en el sistema penitenciario del país, donde las redes entre el Estado y los presos gravan a la población reclusa en nombre de la cárcel.

N2  - Metal detectors became ubiquitous throughout the United States after their use in airports during the late-1960s and early 1970s when they were installed to address hijackings. While earlier perceptions of the technology's invasiveness prevented the metal detector's deployment in the United States beyond jails and prisons, security officials came to identify the device as a means to address the carceral-security state's legitimacy crises and square mass surveillance with demands for civil and political rights. Those designing and implementing the first airport security program understood hijackings as elements of global rebellions against U.S. empire and drew from policing efforts at home and abroad in their efforts to securitize airports. Officials and courts argued that the universality and objectivity of the machine that determined potential danger solely through the presence of metal removed individual police discretion and was thus race-neutral. Claims of the technology's novelty not only obscured its carceral and counterinsurgent origins but helped propel the metal detector's deployment to new spaces including public schools and workplaces. The metal detector reproduced existing class and racial hierarchies and strengthened police discretionary authority.

N2  - BackgroundAn estimated 11 million individuals are released from U.S. jails and prisons each year. Individuals with a history of incarceration have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and mortality compared to the general population, especially in the weeks following release from carceral facilities. Healthy sleep, associated with cardiovascular health, is an underexplored factor in the epidemiology of CVD in this population. Incarcerated people may have unique individual, environmental, and institutional policy-level reasons for being sleep deficient. The social and physical environment within carceral facilities and post-release housing may synergistically affect sleep, creating disparities in sleep and cardiovascular health. Since carceral facilities disproportionately house poor and minoritized groups, population-specific risk factors that impact sleep may also contribute to inequities in cardiovascular outcomes.MethodsThis study is ancillary to an ongoing prospective cohort recruiting 500 individuals with known cardiovascular risk factors within three months of release from incarceration, the Justice-Involved Individuals Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology (JUSTICE) study. The Sleep Justice study will measure sleep health among participants at baseline and six months using three validated surveys: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the STOP-Bang, and the Brief Index of Sleep Control. In a subsample of 100 individuals, we will assess sleep over the course of one week using wrist actigraphy, a validated objective measure of sleep that collects data on rest-activity patterns, sleep, and ambient light levels. Using this data, we will estimate and compare sleep health and its association with CVD risk factor control in individuals recently released from carceral facilities.DiscussionThe incarceration of millions of poor and minoritized groups presents an urgent need to understand how incarceration affects CVD epidemiology. This study will improve our understanding of sleep health among people released from carceral facilities and its potential relationship to CVD risk factor control. Using subjective and objective measures of sleep will allow us to identify unique targets to improve sleep health and mitigate cardiovascular risk in an otherwise understudied population.

N2  - Background: Women are the fastest-growing population in carceral facilities in Canada. Most incarcerated women are mothers, with above-average parity. The incarceration of women has implications not only for women's health, but for that of their children. For example, how is breastfeeding and access to human milk supported in the context of imprisonment? Both carceral and health services are publicly-funded and administered in Canada. Due in part to the well-documented ill-health burden of imprisoned women, health and carceral functions overlap in the spaces of confinement. This paper discusses "breastfeeding in public" in relation to imprisoned women: separated from the public, yet in publicly-funded spaces under public servant control. With increasing adoption of Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFI) Ten Steps in Canadian health centres, there is a need to consider the health centre spaces precluded from its application and make visible the women and children affected. This paper uses the BFI Steps as a lens to consider the environment of confinement for the breastfeeding incarcerated person. The exclusion of breastfeeding and access to human milk for imprisoned women and children extends the punitive carceral function beyond the experience of incarceration and beyond the experience of the convicted mother.
Discussion: Carceral facilities lack breastfeeding policies, foundational to breastfeeding support. Despite high fertility and parity among incarcerated women, carceral health care providers are not required to demonstrate maternity and reproductive health care specialization. The overarching mission of carceral institutions remains security, and support for breastfeeding among incarcerated women is hampered in spaces of conflict, punishment, surveillance and control. A minimal requirement to support exclusive breastfeeding is to promote the mother being with the infant and most incarcerated mothers are separated from their infants. Incarcerated women lack support, information, and community connections for extended breastfeeding beyond six months. Carceral facilities are not welcoming environments for breastfeeding families. Despite the incompatibility of breastfeeding with incarceration, BFI Step 10, coordinating discharge, demonstrates opportunity for improvement through community and health care provider engagement.
Conclusion: Incarceration challenges the reach and applicability of the BFI Steps to enhance breastfeeding and to problematize the idea of breastfeeding "in public."

N2  - Background
Policies for next-of-kin (NOK) notification and disposition of remains surrounding death are unclear across the United States’ (US) carceral systems. The goal of this study was to collect data on carceral system policies pertaining to NOK notification and disposition of remains for individuals who are incarcerated. We collected publicly available operational policies for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 50 state prison systems, and the Washington D.C. jail for a total of 53 systems.
Results
Approximately 70% of systems had available policies on NOK notification and disposition of remains. Few systems had information on time constraints for NOK notification, notifying parties or designated contacts person, and ultimate disposition of unclaimed remains. Several systems had no accessible policies.
Conclusions
Across the US, carceral systems vary in policies for notifying NOK after the death of an incarcerated individual and their processes for the disposition of remains. Carceral and health systems should work towards standardization of policies on communication and disposition of remains after death of an individual who is incarcerated to work towards equity.

She does so through a thorough interrogation of Albert Kligman’s primarily dermatological human experiments at Holmesburg Prison to argue that racial capture enables the research enterprise. Suturing conversations in Black studies, science and technology studies, and carceral studies, each chapter reads objects in relation to these experiments to argue that grounding its brutal procedures was a visual culture enabled by the figurative uses of the skin.

N2  - BackgroundIncarcerated trans women experience significant victimization, mistreatment, barriers to gender-affirming care, and human rights violations, conferring high risk for trauma, psychological distress, self-harm, and suicide. Across the globe, most carceral settings are segregated by sex assigned at birth and governed by housing policies that restrict gender expression-elevating 'safety and security' above the housing preferences of incarcerated people.Aim/methodsDrawing upon the lived experiences of 24 formerly incarcerated trans women in Australia and the United States and employing Elizabeth Freeman's notion of chrononormativity, Rae Rosenberg's concept of heteronormative time, and Kadji Amin's use of queer temporality, this paper explores trans women's carceral housing preferences and contextual experiences, including how housing preferences challenge governing chrononormative and reformist carceral housing systems.FindingsParticipants freely discussed their perspectives regarding housing options which through thematic analysis generated four options for housing: 1) men's carceral settings; 2) women's carceral settings; 3) trans- and gay-specific housing blocks; and 4) being housed in protective custody or other settings. There appeared to be a relationship between the number of times the person had been incarcerated, the duration of their incarceration, and where they preferred to be housed.ConclusionsThis analysis contributes to richer understandings regarding trans women's experiences while incarcerated. This paper also informs the complexities and nuances surrounding housing preferences from the perspectives of trans women themselves and considers possible opportunities to enhance human rights, health and wellbeing when engaging in transformative approaches to incarceration.

N2  - Neighborhood digital platforms – such as Nextdoor, Citizen, Neighbors, anti-crime Facebook groups, Ring surveillance technology, and 311 see-click-fix applications – are recent entrants into urban life. Existing accounts suggest they help build intra-community relationships, but that they also amplify paranoia, racism, and carceral impulses of American homeowners. We ask: how is the new technology increasing solidarity and exclusionary impulses, and what role does it play in the changing American urban landscape? Using offline and online ethnography of one community’s year-long contestation over public space, we find that three effects of the platforms help explain the maintenance of urban order in this case. First, the platforms push residents to see disparate instances of urban disorder as a linked manifestation of organized crime. Second, the platforms help to turn fleeting and uncorroborated accounts into durable events that foster community efficacy. Third, by increasing perceptions of urban disorder and greater community efficacy, the platforms facilitate the accrual of offline material resources. We suggest that in highly contested areas of American cities – areas where wealthy residents vie with a largely Brown and Black working-class for use of space – neighborhood digital platforms help to funnel services that support property value into smaller sections of otherwise disinvested neighborhoods.

N2  - Draws on ethnographic research in WA prisons to explore three dimensions of supermax prison technology: (1) the supermax as machine, as an invention with a purpose & meaning closely linked to its features as a technology; (2) use of specialized tools of control, ie, computerized surveillance, special response teams, & stun technology, that reveal the intersection of technology with intensive confinement, which frames punishment as decisive action rooted in prisoner choices & analogous to war; & (3) imposition of practices & ways of being on prisoners & correctional staff. It is argued that the appearance of specialized technology constitutes a "signifying practice" (per David Garland, 1990). From a Marxian perspective that sees the reification of technology producing an aura of inevitability, it is suggested that framing of supermax primarily in terms of technology is hazardous.

N2  - Seventy-five percent of incarcerated women are of reproductive age, most of whom are at-risk for unintended pregnancy. Women who are incarcerated come disproportionately from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and often lack access to desired reproductive health care. While the carceral system provides a unique opportunity to fill this gap, a better understanding of the contraceptive needs, desires, and plans of incarcerated women is needed to optimize health care provision within the carceral system. A review of current contraceptive services available to women inmates may both identify model care programs and shed light on areas for improvement.
PubMed electronic database used to identify relevant articles published between January 1975 and September 2019 using a systematic review method.
Twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria and answered four key questions surrounding contraception in the carceral system. Most articles (48%) represented scientific research. Other publications identified by this review were expert commentaries, policy briefings, guidance and recommendations reports, and law and bioethics reviews.
Incarcerated women desire access to standard and emergency contraception from carceral health care systems. Knowledgeable family planning practitioners providing patient-centered and trauma-informed care and public health interventions linking newly released inmates to community clinics can help alleviate inmates' concerns regarding initiating desired contraception while incarcerated.

N2  - How should society respond to police surveillance technologies? This question has been at the center of national debates around facial recognition, predictive policing, and digital tracking technologies. It is a debate that has divided activists, law enforcement officials, and academics and will be a central question for years to come as police surveillance technology grows in scale and scope. Do you trust police to use the technology without regulation? Do you ban surveillance technology as a manifestation of discriminatory carceral power that cannot be reformed? Can you regulate police surveillance with a combination of technocratic rules, policies, audits, and legal reforms? This Article explores the taxonomy of past approaches to policing technologies and-finding them all lacking-offers the "tyrant test" as an alternative.
The tyrant test focuses on power. Because surveillance technology offers government a new power to monitor and control citizens, the response must check that power. The question is how, and the answer is to assume the worst. Power will be abused, and constraints must work backwards from that cynical starting point. The tyrant test requires institutional checks that decenter government power into overlapping community institutions with real authority and enforceable individual rights.
The tyrant test borrows its structure from an existing legal framework also designed to address the rise of a potentially tyrannical power-the U.S. Constitution and, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment. Fearful of a centralized federal government with privacy invading intentions, the Fourth Amendment-as metaphor and methodology-offers a guide to approaching surveillance; it allows some technologies but only within a self-reinforcing system of structural checks and balances with power centered in opposition to government. The fear of tyrannical power motivated the original Fourth Amendment and still offers lessons for how society should address the growth of powerful, new surveillance technologies.

N2  - Despite the demonstrated need for sustainable and effective carceral health care, justice-involved medical education curricula are limited, and it’s unclear if informal clinical education is sufficient. Investigators aimed to quantify medical student involvement with carceral populations and explore how students’ knowledge of and attitudes towards justice-involved patients changed over the course of their training. A survey was designed by the investigators and sent to all current medical students at a single United States medical school. Stata 14.0 was used to compare results between the years of medical school. Differences between groups were tested using linear regression. Most 4th year students reported working in a carceral health setting. An increase in overall knowledge of justice-involved patients was observed as carceral medicine education (ptrend = 0.02), hours worked in a jail (ptrend < 0.01), and substance abuse training (ptrend < 0.01) increased. Overall attitude score increased with the students’ reported number of hours working in a jail (ptrend < 0.01) and the amount of substance abuse training (ptrend < 0.01). Finally, we found a trend of increasing knowledge and attitude scores as the year of standing increased (ptrend < 0.01). Our data suggest that most USC medical students work in a carceral setting during medical school. Didactic and experiential learning opportunities correlated with improved knowledge of and attitude toward justice-involved patients, with increases in both metrics increasing as the year in medical school increased. However, senior medical students still scored poorly. These findings underscore the need for a formal curriculum to train our healthcare workforce in health equity for carceral populations.

N2  - A critical examination of the prison system demonstrates that there is a direct relationship between methods of control and prevailing scientific discoveries. The correctional mandate is scripted according to various technological innovations that provide the prison system with increased control and surveillance capabilities. From the first prison cell constructed of cast iron bars, to the increasing reliance on electronic devices, the penal agenda is defined and mediated through the discourse of technological change. This dissertation is an exploratory inquiry that critically examines the ramifications of electronic technologies on the correctional system. Specifically, the computer has reconfigured the ways in which inmates and correctional agents interact within an electrified prison subculture. In exploring the technologically constituted carceral culture, this investigation evaluates the social impact that devices such as offender management computer systems, electronic monitors and prison computer bulletin boards have had on the trajectory of correctional practice and policy. This research clearly demonstrates that the prison subculture has become electrified through the continued reliance on computer technology. Further, the penal agenda has become contextualized within the bureaucratic interests of 'speed' and 'convenience'. The infatuation that many correctional actors have with the emancipatory capabilities of computers demonstrates that the penal structure has imprisoned itself within the normative contours of technologically defined stages of carceral presentation. Computerized sites of social interaction are far too frequently overlooked by researchers, who are ill equipped to traverse these "virtual communities". This exploratory study seeks to 'get connected' with the electrified correctional culture and conduct research not in a physical space, but within cyberspace. Conceptually and substantively this investigation builds on traditional sociological paradigms, developing a "techno-criminological" model through which to critically examine the electrification of various aspects of the criminal justice system. In conclusion, this exploratory study identifies not only the extent to which computers have monopolized the correctional system, but the ways in which technology has rearticulated penological theory and research. Strategies will be articulated which empower those utilizing these devices, directly influencing specific areas of concern in the correctional system, including: staff development, inmate care, and linkages with other criminal justice agencies.

N2  - While the broader medical community grapples with the widely accepted notion that it takes an average of 17 years for research evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice, the implementation of evidence-based interventions in carceral settings (i.e., jails and prisons) faces longer delays, exacerbating health disparities.
The "prison implementation penalty" describes the significant delay in and limited adoption of evidence-based healthcare practices in carceral settings. We explore the complex challenges of implementing evidence-based interventions in jails and prisons, environments where healthcare often plays a secondary role under security and discipline. We use specific frameworks to highlight the unique barriers within these settings and propose potential implementation strategies. These challenges have broad implications for health equity due to the disproportionate impact on the marginalized groups affected by mass incarceration. Implementation science has potential to mitigate these disparities.
Bridging the gap between healthcare evidence and practice in carceral settings offers a public health opportunity. Implementation science offers a unique role in improving healthcare standards and reducing health inequities in this environment.

N2  - ObjectivesOur objectives were to document data availability and reporting on suicide mortality in state prison systems. The United States leads the world in mass incarceration, a structural determinant of health, but lacks real-time reporting of prison health statistics. This absence is particularly notable in suicides, a leading cause of death that carceral policies play a key role in mitigating. MethodsSuicide data for each state prison system from 2017-2021 were gathered through statistical reports, press releases, and Freedom of Information Act requests. We graded states based on data availability. ResultsOnly sixteen states provide updated, frequent, granular, freely provided suicide data. An additional thirteen states provided frequently updated data but that had little granularity, was incomplete, or was not freely provided. Eight states provided sparse, infrequent, or outdated data, and thirteen provided no data at all. ConclusionsThe 2000 Death in Custody Reporting Act requires that states provide these data freely, yet the majority of states do not. There is a need for reliable, real-time data on suicides, suicide attempts, and conditions of confinement to better understand the harms of the carceral system and to advocate for change.

N2  - This thesis treats human migration as an essential human right– one which deserves durable, designed solutions. Sited in the Central Mediterranean, the project reframes the choreography of the harrowing journey from Tripoli to the shores of Lampedusa as a suspense of flight. By inviting people to stay, receive care and prepare for the landing in Europe, the Mediterranean becomes a watery grounds for agency and self-determination among those migrating. The design outcome of the thesis is the building of a nomadic, mission-based utopia among the discards of offshore oil technology: a collectively governed, stateless, and artificial island which resists the carceral qualities of state-run camps. The sea is no longer the final frontier in a long flight from home, but a stepping stone to self-actualizing one’s dreams.

N2  - Abstract
Background
Prior studies demonstrate that eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States (US) heavily depends on treating incarcerated persons. Knowing the scope of the carceral HCV epidemic by state will help guide national elimination efforts.
Methods
Between 2019 and 2023, all state prison systems received surveys requesting data on hepatitis C antibody and viremic prevalence. We supplemented survey information with publicly available HCV data to corroborate responses and fill in data gaps.
Results
Weighting HCV prevalence by state prison population size, we estimate that 15.2% of the US prison population is HCV seropositive and 8.7% is viremic; 54.9% of seropositive persons have detectable RNA. Applying prevalence estimates to the total prison population at year-end 2021, 91 090 persons with HCV infection resided in a state prison.
Conclusions
With updated and more complete HCV data from all 50 states, HCV prevalence in state prisons is nearly 9-fold higher than the US general population. The heterogeneity in HCV prevalence by state prison system may reflect variable exposure before arrest and/or differences in treatment availability during incarceration. Elimination of HCV in the country depends on addressing the carceral epidemic, and one of the first steps is understanding the size of the problem.

N2  - The final chapter once again mobilizes ethnographic data as a means of examining the paradox character of Brazil’s electronic monitoring (EM) policies: although, on the one hand, EM tends to function as a supplementary control mechanism that effectively enlarges and amplifies the penal system’s reach; on the other it is undeniable that the diverging appropriations of the technology by local governments as well as criminal gangs entail a considerable loss of control and, indeed, a significant degree of contingency concerning its future materializations. The first section of the chapter retrieves the ethnographic observation carried out in the Electronic Monitoring Cell of Ceará and contextualizes the EM policy put in place amid the escalation of urban violence wreaked across the state by prison factions. It reviews Ceará’s EM policies by juxtaposing their technical and institutional failures. Challenging the recurrent identification of a the empirical materialization of a policy with its operational blueprint, the section sustains the argument that the supposed failure of a technology may indeed provide a valuable starting point for examining its political performances in a more encompassing way. In the final part an attempt is made to systematize the effects of EM policies in contemporary Brazil by suggesting four main categories, namely a centrifugal expansion of the penal system; a centripetal densification of punitive control; the securitarian administration of the penal system; and the virtualization and de-territorialization of carceral violence. Detected during field research, each of these categories signals specific aspects of the symbiotic relationship established between prison and electronic monitoring in Brazil.

N2  - This article explores the body as a site of subjectivity production during a hunger strike in Occupied Palestine. It further explores the former political prisoners’ theory of subjectivity as it emerges through their praxis and philosophy of freedom. Although the body is the principal tool that the hunger strikers use, they don't consider it the decisive factor in attaining their goal. For that they build on the immaterial strength that develops with the deterioration of the body and from which they construct the concept of rouh (soul). This is expressed through the formation of contradictory binaries: body versus soul and body versus mind. The article shows that the hunger strike not only is a political strategy for liberation; it also moves into a spiritualization of the struggle. It uses and problematizes Foucault's “technologies of the self” to theorize the specific formation of subjectivity in the Palestinian hunger strike under colonial conditions, and it contributes to theories of subjectivation. The hunger strikers, in their interaction with the dispossession of the colonial power, invent technologies of resistance to transcend the colonial and carceral constraints on their freedom and create the capacity for the transformation from a submissive subject to a resistant one.

Nous nous proposons d’observer les comportements du sujet parlant détenu lors de l’expression de son identité discursive. Notre objectif est de comprendre la mesure dans laquelle la nouvelle identité, une fois manifestée, permet au détenu d’exister pour une période plus ou moins longue dans le milieu d’incarcération. En règle générale, l’identité discursive consiste dans l’adaptation du discours de tout locuteur aux situations de communication que les nouveaux contacts sociaux lui imposent et, en conséquence, aux communautés socio-discursives auxquelles il appartient.

N2  - After 30 years of relentless expansion, the United States’ prison system faces the prospect of considerable contraction. This was certainly not expected and continues to be refuted by policy makers, activists, and academic theorists alike. Using evidence drawn from New York State, this essay argues that decarceration is taking place and may be expected to continue. Preliminary findings indicate, however, that the outcome is not likely to be the most commonly speculated ones: a return to a rehabilitative model, liberal reform along the lines of justice reinvestment, or the straightforward replacement of mass incarceration with parole and probation. Evidence to date suggests that a new and harsher criminal justice regime marked by justice disinvestment is being forged, entailing a significant shift from state penal institutions to differentiated, community-based social control, new private and non-profit actors, and new data and hardware technologies. These observations suggest a substantial rethinking of the political economy and theories of mass incarceration and the ‘carceral’ or ‘centaur’ state.

N2  - In Life beside Bars, Heath Pearson showcases dynamic, interdependent community as the best hope for undoing the systems of confinement that reproduce capital in Cumberland County, New Jersey—a place that is home to three state prisons, one federal prison, and the regional jail. Pearson places today’s prisons within the region’s longer history of Lenape genocide, chattel slavery, Japanese American labor camps, and other forms of racialized punishment and carceral control. From this vantage, prisons appear not as the structural fix for the region’s failed political economy but as a continuation of the carceral principle that has always sustained it. This ongoing use of confinement, though, is merely the backdrop. Through ethnographic vignettes written in story form, Pearson offers an alternative history of the unruly and unexpected ways that people resist, get by, make money, find joy, and build radical social life in the small, unseen spaces beside large-scale confinement. As such, Pearson enriches our understanding of daily life in and around prisons—in any American community—while providing a kaleidoscope of possibilities for theorizing and organizing alternative paths.

A transversal descriptive study was conducted between September 23rd and September 27th 2013 among all inmates of this prison. We used an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, distributed at lunchtime and collected, the same day, at dinnertime, by the mental health service personnel.
Among 785 inmates present at the time of the study in the prison of Lyon-Corbas, 710 were included and the response rate was 64.4% (95% CI [60.8–67.8]). Among 457 responding inmates, 16.4% (95% CI [13.2–20.0]) reported no PAS consumption. Among 382 consumers, 74.4% (95% CI [69.8–78.5]) used tobacco, 36.8% (95% CI [32.2–41.8]) cannabis, 30.4% (95% CI [25.9–35.1]) alcohol, 7.7% (95% CI [5.2–10.6]) heroin and 10.3% (95% CI [7.5–13.6]) cocaine. Furthermore, 15% of consumers had started PAS consumption during their incarceration. Among consumers of at least one PAS other than tobacco, cannabis and alcohol, the way of consumption was sniff for 60.0% (95% CI [48.5–70.2]) and injection for 31.0% (95% CI [21.6–42.1]). Use of several PAS at the same time and sharing sniffing and/or injection paraphernalia were other risky behaviors observed; 12% (95% CI [5.8–20.4]) of drug injectors declared using chlorine to sterilize their injection paraphernalia.
Our study provides worrying data about PAS consumption in prison. The measures of prohibition do not prevent this consumption. There is even an initiation of consumption of PAS for 15% of the first-time incarcerated inmates. This finding should encourage public authorities to facilitate access of inmates to the care structures in prisons, to improve drug use prevention and care programs and to develop activities (sports, cultural, educational and vocational).
En prison, en 2012, selon diverses sources, 4 à 56 % de la population carcérale d’Europe consommaient des substances psycho-actives (SPA). Le but de notre étude était de décrire la consommation de SPA pendant l’incarcération à la prison de Lyon-Corbas.
Une étude descriptive transversale a été menée entre le 23 et le 27 septembre 2013 auprès de tous les détenus de cette prison. Nous avons utilisé un questionnaire auto-administré anonyme, distribué à l’heure du déjeuner et recueilli le même jour au moment du dîner par le personnel de service de santé mentale.
Au total, 710 des 785 détenus présents dans la prison de Lyon-Corbas au moment de l’étude ont été inclus et le taux de réponse était de 64,4 % (IC à 95 % [60,8–67,8]). Parmi les 457 répondants, 16,4 % (IC à 95 % [13,2–20,0]) ne déclaraient aucune consommation. Parmi les 382 consommateurs, 74,4 % (IC à 95 % [69,8–78,5]) consommaient du tabac, 36,8 % (IC à 95 % [32,2–41,8]) du cannabis, 30,4 % (IC à 95 % [25,9–35,1]) de l’alcool, 7,7 % (IC à 95 % [5,2–10,6]) de l’héroïne et 10,3 % (IC à 95 % [7,5–13,6]) de la cocaïne. Par ailleurs, 15 % des consommateurs déclaraient avoir initié une consommation de SPA durant leur incarcération. Parmi les consommateurs d’au moins un produit autre que le cannabis, le tabac et l’alcool, la voie de consommation était le sniff pour 60,0 % (IC à 95 % [48,5–70,2]) et l’injection pour 31,0 % (IC à 95 % [21,6–42,1]). La consommation simultanée de plusieurs SPA et le partage de matériel de sniff et/ou d’injection figuraient parmi les comportements à risque observés ; 12 % (IC à 95 % [5,8–20,4]) des injecteurs déclaraient stériliser leur matériel d’injection à l’aide d’eau de javel.
Notre étude fournit des données inquiétantes sur la consommation de SPA en prison. Les mesures d’interdiction n’empêchent pas cette consommation. Cette découverte devrait encourager les pouvoirs publics à faciliter l’accès des détenus aux structures de soins en milieu carcéral, afin d’améliorer les programmes de prévention et de soins en addictologie et de développer des activités (sportives, culturelles, éducatives et professionnelles).

N2  - Incarceration has a multitude of effects on prisoners’ finances, health, education, employment, and family relationships. Incarceration complicates the maintenance of attachment bonds between romantic partners. Data from the Multi‐site Family Study on Incarceration, Parenting, and Partnering were analyzed to examine the effects of childhood stability on adult romantic attachment while controlling for the effects of PTSD and depression within the carceral population. Findings indicate that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression have statistically significant effects on adult romantic attachment. PTSD on romantic attachment for men is statistically significant (p < 0.05) at −0.193 with an overall standardized effect of −0.086. For women, the effect is statistically significant (p < 0.01) at −0.235 with an overall standardized effect of −0.1. Effects of depression on romantic attachment for men is statistically significant (p < 0.001) −0.129 with an overall standardized effect of −0.229. For women, depression is also statistically significant (p < 0.001) at −0.153 with a standardized effect of −0.265. We examined the effects of childhood stability on adult romantic attachment while controlling for the effects of PTSD and depression within the carceral population. Findings supported our hypothesis that individuals with better childhood stability will experience better romantic attachments. Findings related to our hypothesis that having a partner with better childhood stability is positively associated with better romantic attachment produced mixed results. Clinical implications are discussed, and future directions call for research, practice, and training to improve outcomes for justice‐involved romantic partners, their attachment, and consideration of covariates of depression and PTSD.

N2  - BackgroundHIV disproportionately impacts people who experience incarceration. Incarceration represents an opportunity to engage in HIV prevention care for individuals who often experience a number of barriers accessing health services in the community. The development of evidence-based practices promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention (PrEP) is crucial for ending the HIV epidemic within this highly marginalized population. However, PrEP research within carceral facilities has been limited and is hampered in part by the lack of ethical guidance on conducting HIV prevention research in this unique setting where incarcerated individuals are categorized as a vulnerable population requiring specific protections. This lack of knowledge is particularly striking when considering the lack of input from incarcerated individuals themselves on the responsible conduct of research, which is critical to understanding ways to ensure participant autonomy while avoiding coercive practices in research activities.MethodsIn order to gain a better understanding of ethical approaches to the conduct of HIV prevention research among incarcerated individuals, we conducted qualitative interviews with 21 incarcerated men who reported injecting drugs and met clinical criteria for PrEP use. The interview topics included HIV knowledge, PrEP knowledge, stigma, and perceptions related to ethical research practices.ResultsThemes identified included how forced abstinence during incarceration can negatively affect research participation, the importance of participant comfort as it relates to ensuring autonomy in decision making, a desire for person centred approaches in research activities, study staff characteristics impacting participant experience, and perceptions of carceral staff as members of research teams.ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that conducting research focused on improving PrEP use in a carceral environment has support among those experiencing incarceration. However, researchers should place the participant experience at the center of research protocol development.

N2  - Recent rises in incident tuberculosis (TB) cases in Paraguay and the increasing concentration of TB within prisons highlight the urgency of targeting strategies to interrupt transmission and prevent new infections. However, whether specific cities or carceral institutions play a disproportionate role in transmission remains unknown. We conducted prospective genomic surveillance, sequencing 471 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex genomes, from inside and outside prisons in Paraguay’s two largest urban areas, Asunción and Ciudad del Este, from 2016 to 2021. We found genomic evidence of frequent recent transmission within prisons and transmission linkages spanning prisons and surrounding populations. We identified a signal of frequent
M. tuberculosis
spread between urban areas and marked recent population size expansion of the three largest genomic transmission clusters. Together, our findings highlight the urgency of strengthening TB control programs to reduce transmission risk within prisons in Paraguay, where incidence was 70 times that outside prisons in 2021.
To role that carceral institutions play in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
transmission remains somewhat unknown. Authors perform a prospective genomic surveillance study, to assess transmission dynamics in prisons and surrounding communities in Paraguay.

N2  - Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of potentially hazardous heat conditions across the United States, putting the incarcerated population of 2 million at risk for heat-related health conditions. We evaluate the exposure to potentially hazardous heat for 4,078 continental US carceral facilities during 1982–2020. Results show that the number of hot days per year increased during 1982–2020 for 1,739 carceral facilities, primarily located in the southern United States. State-run carceral facilities in Texas and Florida accounted for 52% of total exposure, despite holding 12% of all incarcerated people. This highlights the urgency for enhanced infrastructure, health system interventions and treatment of incarcerated people, especially under climate change.
An increasingly warm climate can lead to more intense, frequent and longer periods of hazardous heat, increasing the risk of heat-related health concerns. This study assesses whether incarcerated people in the United States are potentially disproportionately exposed to such hazardous heat conditions.

N2  - Abstract
The cancer disparities between people with incarceration histories compared with those who do not have those histories are vast. Opportunities for bolstering cancer equity among those impacted by mass incarceration exist in criminal legal system policy; carceral, community, and public health linkages; better cancer prevention, screening, and treatment services in carceral settings; expansion of health insurance; education of professionals; and use of carceral sites for health promotion and transition to community care. Clinicians, researchers, persons with a history of incarceration, carceral administrators, policy makers, and community advocates could play a cancer equity role in each of these areas. Raising awareness and setting a cancer equity plan of action are critical to reducing cancer disparities among those affected by mass incarceration.

During the 20th century the locus of care shifted from large institutions into the community. However, this shift was not always accompanied by liberation from restrictive practices. In 2014 a UK Supreme Court ruling on the meaning of ‘deprivation of liberty’ resulted in large numbers of older and disabled people in care homes, supported living and family homes being re-categorized as ‘detained’.
Placing this ruling in its social, historical and global context, this book presents a socio-legal analysis of social care detention in the post-carceral era. Drawing from disability rights law and the meanings of ‘home’ and ‘institution’ it proposes solutions to the Cheshire West ruling’s paradoxical implications.

N2  - Background
Individuals who are incarcerated have greater healthcare needs than non-justice-involved individuals, yet incarcerated individuals often report substandard care. There are disproportionate numbers of black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) in prison, who, even in general society face greater obstacles to accessing healthcare and have worse health outcomes due to structural racism. Regardless of race, people with criminal justice involvement often report stigma from the non-carceral healthcare system. Providing sufficient healthcare in carceral settings themselves is complicated by lack of privacy and the inherent dialectic of prisons that restrict freedom and providers focusing on healing and health. Based on these adverse experiences, people who are incarcerated may have decreased distrust in the healthcare system, deterring individuals from getting adequate medical care.
Methods
In this exploratory study, health care system distrust was evaluated among 200 people who were incarcerated using the Revised Health Care System Distrust scale, a community-validated, 9-item measure comprised of 2 subscales (
values
and
competence
distrust).
Results
Distrust was moderately and positively associated with participant age (
r
s
 = 0.150,
p
 = 0.034), with the second-oldest quintile (33 to 42-year-olds) reporting the highest level of overall and competence distrust. Participants identifying as Non-Latinx White reported higher competence distrust compared to Latinx and Non-Latinx/Non-White respondents.
Conclusions
These preliminary findings suggest that select groups of prisoners may be less likely to trust the healthcare system, highlighting an impediment to receiving adequate care while incarcerated. Further study of this topic is warranted.

N2  - Background and method
Pretrial detention makes up 75% of juvenile detention admissions and contributes to the disproportionate contact of minoritized youth in the juvenile carceral system. Given that prior evidence largely examines differences between Black and white youth, this study expands research on disproportionate contact in the pretrial detention setting to Hispanic/Latinx, Indigenous, and Asian youth. With a sample of over 44,000 juvenile cases in a northwest state, we used a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the effect of individual level characteristics while accounting for the random effect of differences at the county level. Additionally, we utilized Critical Race Theory (CRT) in formulating our theoretical model and predictions and apply CRT in our analysis and discussion of our results. In doing so we hope to build upon its application in public health discourse for naming and deconstructing processes that lead to unjust social and health stratification.
Results
After factoring in gender, age, crime severity, previous offenses, and variation between counties, our analyses show that Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth are more likely to experience pretrial detention than white youth. The likelihood of pretrial detention for Asian youth and for youth identified as “Other” or “Unknown” was not significantly different from white youth.
Conclusions
As the iatrogenic effects of detention are disproportionately imposed upon youth of color—particularly Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic/Latinx youth—the disparities present in our study reveal further evidence of institutional racism. In this way, we can see how this carceral process operates as a mechanism of racialized social stratification as put forth by CRT. Considering implications for policy or further research, persistent disparity highlights an enduring need for building or strengthening diversion programs and alternatives to the carceral system, with emphasis on those that are culturally responsive.

N2  - This dissertation examines the colonial experience in the Islamic Philippines between 1899 and 1942. Occupying Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago in 1899, U.S. Army officials assumed sovereignty over a series of Muslim populations collectively referred to as ‘Moros.’ Beholden to pre-existing notions of Moro ungovernability, for two decades military and civilian administrators ruled the Southern Philippines separately from the Christian regions of the North. In the 1920s, Islamic areas of Mindanao and Sulu were ‘normalized’ and haphazardly assimilated into the emergent Philippine nation-state. Never fully integrated, the Muslim South persisted as an exotic frontier zone in the American and Filipino colonial imaginaries. The following chapters argue that Americans acting in both official and non-official capacities undertook a project of cultural reconfiguration among the Moros. Essentializing Moro ‘characteristics,’ American colonial actors implemented a variety of programs aimed at transforming Muslim social, legal, commercial, medical, and educational practices. These complex and imperfect processes often met with resistance from Moro populations, and American authorities used violence as a means of ‘correcting’ recalcitrant behaviours. A second seam of argumentation asserts the centrality of inter-imperial dialogue and transfer to the colonial experience in the Southern Philippines. Americans borrowed and modified European imperial antecedents in myriad ways, from carceral technologies to the creation of racially demarcated leisure spaces. As a region, the Muslim South was shaped during the period under study by transcolonial flows of personnel, ideas, and commercial products. This involved transfers not only between Americans and Europeans, but also between Moros and the Islamic world. Emphasizing understudied and unstoried histories, this project contributes to a growing body of work that situates American colonial encounters in a global context. Overlooked in much of the literature on American colonialism in the Philippines, the Muslim South was an important site for the development of American civilizational imperatives. These imperatives, and the colonial project writ large, were shaped and reshaped by pervasive supraregional connectivities and inter-imperial exchanges. Far from being mere colonial backwaters, Mindanao and Sulu are critical to understanding the character of American empire in the early twentieth century.

N2  - The field of medical action extends beyond the clinical encounter. Rather, clinical encounters are organized by wider regimes of governance and expertise, and broader geographies of care, abandonment and violence. Clinical encounters in penal institutions condense and render visible the fundamental situatedness of all clinical care. This article considers the complexity of clinical action in carceral institutions and their wider geographies through an examination of the crisis of mental health care in jails, an issue of significant public concern in the United States and much of the world. We present findings from our engaged, collaborative clinical ethnography, which was informed by and seeking to inform already existing collective struggles. Revisiting the concept of “pragmatic solidarity” (Farmer in Partner to the poor: a Paul Farmer reader, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2010) in an era of “carceral humanitarianism” (Gilmore in Futures of Black Radicalism, Verso, New York, 2017, see also Kilgore in Repackaging mass incarceration, Counterpunch, June 6–8,
http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/06/06/repackaging-mass-incarceration/
, 2014), we draw on theorists who consider prisons to be institutions of “organized violence” (Gilmore and Gilmore in: Heatherton and Camp (eds) Policing the planet: why the policing crisis led to Black lives matter, Verso, New York, 2016). We argue that clinicians may have an important role in joining struggles for “organized care” that can counter institutions of organized violence.

N2  - Although incarcerated women are a highly victimized population, therapy for sexual violence victimization (SVV) sequela is not routinely offered in prison. SHARE is a group therapy for SVV survivors that was successfully implemented and sustained in a women’s correction center. Here, we aimed to identify implementation factors and strategies that led to SHARE’s success and describe incarcerated women’s perspectives on the program. We conducted a retrospective process evaluation using interviews structured according to EPIS, a well‐established implementation science framework. Participants (N = 22) were incarcerated women, members of the SHARE treatment team, and members of the correction center’s leadership, therapeutic team, and volunteer program. Factors that facilitated SHARE implementation varied by EPIS phase and organization. Positive inter‐organizational and interpersonal relationships were key across phases, as were the synergies between both the strengths and needs of each organization involved in implementation. Incarcerated women reported a strong need for SHARE and did not report any concerns about receiving trauma therapy in a carceral setting. Therapy for SVV sequelae, including exposure‐based therapy, is possible to implement and sustain in carceral settings. Community–academic partnerships may be a particularly feasible way to expand access to SVV therapy for incarcerated women.
Highlights
Described implementing a group therapy for survivors of sexual violence within a women’s prison.
Evaluated contextual factors and strategies that led to successful sustainment of the group.
Includes views of incarcerated women, members of the treatment team, and prison leadership.
Found personal and organizational partnerships were key to effecting and sustaining the program.
Incarcerated women noted a need for trauma therapy and felt prison was a suitable setting for it.

N2  - Although incarcerated adults are at elevated risk of dying from cancer, little is known about cancer screening in carceral settings. This study compared stage-specific incidence of screen-detectable cancers among incarcerated and recently released people with the general population, as a reflection of screening practices. We calculated the age- and sex-standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for early- and late-stage cancers for incarcerated and recently released adults compared to the general Connecticut population between 2005 and 2016. Our sample included 143 cancer cases among those incarcerated, 406 among those recently released, and 201 360 in the general population. The SIR for early-stage screen-detectable cancers was lower among incarcerated (SIR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.43) and recently released (SIR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.88) individuals than the general population. Incidence of late-stage screen-detectable cancer was lower during incarceration (SIR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27 to 0.88) but not after release (SIR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.93 to 1.82). Findings suggest that underscreening and underdetection of cancer may occur in carceral settings.

N2  - Background: Until recently, few carceral facilities offered medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Although more facilities are adopting MOUD, much remains to be learned about addressing implementation challenges related to expansion of MOUD in carceral settings and linkage to care upon re-entry. This is particularly important in jails, where individuals cycle rapidly in and out of these facilities, especially in jurisdictions beginning to implement bail reform laws (i.e., laws that remove the requirement to pay bail for most individuals). Increasing access to MOUD in these settings is a key unexplored challenge.
Methods: In this qualitative study, we interviewed staff from county jails across New Jersey, a state that has implemented state-wide efforts to increase capacity for MOUD treatment in jails. We analyzed themes related to current practices used to engage individuals in MOUD while in jail and upon re-entry; major challenges to delivering MOUD and re-entry services, particularly under bail reform conditions; and innovative strategies to facilitate delivery of these services.
Results: Jail staff from 11 New Jersey county jails participated in a baseline survey and an in-depth qualitative interview from January-September 2020. Responses revealed that practices for delivering MOUD varied substantially across jails. Primary challenges included jails' limited resources and highly regulated operations, the chaotic nature of short jail stays, and concerns regarding limited MOUD and resources in the community. Still, jail staff identified multiple facilitators and creative solutions for delivering MOUD in the face of these obstacles, including opportunities brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions: Despite challenges to the delivery of MOUD, states can make concerted and sustained efforts to support opioid addiction treatment in jails. Increased use of evidence-based clinical guidelines, greater investment in resources, and increased partnerships with health and social service providers can greatly improve reach of treatment and save lives.

N2  - Solitary confinement is a harrowing human rights and public health problem that is currently inflicted as a routine punishment for a litany of prison rule violations, a reactionary tactic to quell resistance to prison conditions, and as a destination of last resort for people serious mental illnesses (SMI) who are especially vulnerable to its harms. An extensive body of research has documented clusters of psychiatric symptoms—emotional distress, cognitive deficits, social withdrawal, anxiety, paranoia, sleeplessness, and hallucinations—linked to solitary confinement that often manifest in decompensating behaviors, which include self-injury and suicide. This study summarizes the historical evolution of solitary confinement, recaps its linkages to self-injury and suicidality, and offers a theoretical framework grounded in ecosocial theory, and supplemented with concepts from theories of dehumanization and carceral geography. Findings bolster extant evidence on the harms of solitary confinement by focusing on whether and how exertions of power by prison staff to deploy mechanisms of dehumanization—as a pathway between SMI and self-injury among a cross section of adult men (n = 517) exposed to solitary confinement in Louisiana prisons in 2017. Findings reinforce the need for structural interventions that diffuse forms of carceral power and practices that continue to subject people to isolation, dehumanization, and violence.

N2  - BackgroundPeople incarcerated during the COVID-19 pandemic face higher vulnerability to infection due to structural and social factors in carceral settings. Additionally, due to the higher prevalence of chronic health conditions among carceral populations, they are also at risk for more severe COVID-19 disease. This study was designed to explore the experiences of people incarcerated in prisons and jails in Maryland during the height of the pandemic. MethodsWe conducted semi-structured phone interviews between January 2021 and April 2022 with ten individuals incarcerated in Maryland carceral facilities during the height of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic and were subsequently released from prison or jail. We transcribed the interviews, coded them, and engaged in content analysis, an inductive analytical approach to developing themes and meaning from qualitative data. ResultsFour themes emerged from participants' descriptions of their experiences: (1) distress from fear, vulnerability, and lack of knowledge about COVID-19 and how to protect themselves, (2) shortcomings of prison and jail administrators and other personnel through lack of transparency and arbitrary and punitive enforcement of COVID-19 protocols, (3) lack of access to programming and communication with others, and (4) absence of preparation for release and access to usual re-entry services. ConclusionParticipants responded that the prison and jails' response during the COVID-19 pandemic was ill-prepared, inconsistent, and without appropriate measures to mitigate restrictions on liberty and prepare them for release. The lack of information sharing amplified their sense of fear and vulnerability unique to their incarceration status. Study findings have several institutional implications, such as requiring carceral facilities to establish public health preparedness procedures and making plans publicly available.

N2  - Antecedents of racist treatments of Black patients by the psychiatric profession in the United States affect the way they view treatment today. Specifically, in this essay, we explore the enduring consequences of racial science on various treatment practices.
We examined a range of primary sources on the history of racial theories about the mind, medical and psychiatric publications, and hospitals. We contextualize this analysis by examining the secondary literature in the history and sociology of psychiatry. Through analyzing racial thinking from the antebellum through the Jim Crow periods, we show how US medicine and psychiatry have roots in antebellum racial science and how carceral logics underpinned the past and present politics of Black mental health.
Changing this trajectory requires practitioners to interrogate the historical foundations of racist psychiatric concepts. This essay urges them to reject biological racial realism, which bears reminiscences to 19th-century racial science, and embrace the variable of race as a social construct to study social inequalities in health as a first step toward moving away from the legacies of past injustices in medicine.

N2  - The health effects of police surveillance practices for the community at-large are unknown. Using microlevel health data from the 2009–2012 New York City Community Health Survey (NYC-CHS) nested within mesolevel data from the 2009–2012 NYC Stop, Question, and Frisk (NYC-SQF) dataset, this study evaluates contextual and ethnoracially variant associations between invasive aspects of pedestrian stops and multiple dimensions of poor health. Results reveal that living in neighborhoods where pedestrian stops are more likely to become invasive is associated with worse health. Living in neighborhoods where stops are more likely to result in frisking show the most consistent negative associations. More limited deleterious effects can be attributed to living in neighborhoods where stops are more likely to involve use of force or in neighborhoods with larger ethnoracial disparities in frisking or use of force. However, the health effects of pedestrian stops vary by ethnoracial group in complex ways. For instance, minorities who live in neighborhoods with a wider ethno racial disparity in police behavior have poorer health outcomes in most respects, but blacks have lower odds of diabetes when they live in neighborhoods where they face a higher risk that a stop will involve use of force by police than do whites. The findings suggest that the consequences of the institutionalization of the carceral state are far-reaching.

N2  - Aims and objectives
To inform a systematic synthesis of what is known about the maternal health outcomes of incarcerated women, this scoping review uses a theoretical framework of intersectional feminism.
Background
Despite rising imprisonment of women, there is a lack of research, from a feminist perspective, on perinatal health outcomes among incarcerated women.
Design
Systematic scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology.
Methods
In consultation with a medical research librarian, key databases and journals were searched for English and French‐language articles published up to February 2018. Two authors independently screened titles and s to identify articles for full‐text review. Study quality was appraised using the McGill Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The study adheres to PRISMA‐EQUATOR guidelines.
Results
Forty‐five studies met the preset criteria and were reviewed in full text. In addition, 13 studies met consensus for inclusion. Method, setting, participants, sample, relevant outcomes and relevant findings were extracted from each study for synthesis. Included studies had varied methods and were published from 1989–2014. Participants included women imprisoned during the perinatal period up to six months postpartum. All studies were conducted in carceral contexts, with 12 based in the USA and one in Australia. Outcomes of interest included breastfeeding, operative deliveries, gestational complications, depression, stress, experiences, bonding and sterilisation.
Conclusion
The research on maternal health outcomes pertaining to incarcerated women is limited. There is a need for in‐depth examination of breastfeeding with this population. Researchers need to examine the prevalence and impact of carceral force, such as shackling, solitary confinement, strip‐searching and restraints in pregnancy. There is a need for research that asks what health outcomes matter to the women themselves.
Relevance to clinical practice
Providers must be conscious of intersecting layers of discrimination and trauma incarcerated women experience and its impact on maternal health in the perinatal period and advocate for women.

N2  - Carceral institutions are among the largest clusters of COVID-19 in the United States. In response, activists and detainees have rallied around decarceration demands: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This article theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated (RCS) communities.
The authors provide an in-depth account of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and the mobilization to reduce contagions. They also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and to measure the effects of information about racial inequalities in prison and poor conditions inside migrant detention centers.
The authors found only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. They also found Americans are more supportive of harm reduction measures than decarceration efforts. Information about racial disparities increases support decarceration. They did not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers.
The conditions in carceral institutions during the pandemic—and public opinion about them—highlight the realities of compounding racialized vulnerability in the United States.

N2  - For the millions of people incarcerated in United States' prisons and jails during the COVID-19 pandemic, isolation took many forms, including medical isolation for those sick with COVID-19, quarantine for those potentially exposed, and prolonged facility-wide lockdowns. Incarcerated people's lived experience of isolation during the pandemic has largely gone undocumented. Through interviews with 48 incarcerated people and 27 staff at two jails and one prison in geographically diverse locations in the United States, we document the implementation of COVID-19 isolation policies from the perspective of those that live and work in carceral settings. Incarcerated people were isolated from social contact, educational programs, employment, and recreation, and lacked clear communication about COVID-19-related protocols. Being isolated, no matter the reason, felt like punishment and was compared to solitary confinement-with resultant long-term, negative impacts on health. Participants detailed isolation policies as disruptive, detrimental to mental health, and dehumanizing for incarcerated people. Findings point to several recommendations for isolation policy in carceral settings. These include integrating healthcare delivery into isolation protocols, preserving social relationships during isolation, promoting bidirectional communication about protocols and their effect between facility leadership and incarcerated people. Most importantly, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the current approach to the use of isolation in carceral settings and to establish external oversight procedures for its use during pandemics.

N2  - Recent discussions on technology and gender-violence prevention emphasize that technoscientific applications often advance pro-punishment logics that enact gendered inequalities. Less attention has focused on racialized dimensions and how technology might advance abolitionist and transformative justice agendas. In response, this article considers how inventors mobilize technology as a frontline response to sexual violence, in which technoscience—rather than police—enables individuals, friends, and family to provide safety and mutual aid. Through analysis of seven popular technologies produced between 2010 and 2020, this paper documents how their “abolitionist sensibility” is accompanied by fellow-traveler discourses that are unattuned to intersecting power relations. Findings suggest that while this sociotechnical imaginary is reacting to state power, it reinforces a race-neutral and techno-optimistic vision for building a violence-free future. These power-evasive politics may thus signal increased susceptibility to carceral creep and coercive surveillant regimes. After discussing these double-edge politics, I conclude by discussing power formations that are left unexamined in the imaginary and how to cultivate a counter-carceral praxis in line with transformative justice goals.

N2  - Background
Prisons face challenges in meeting the unique health care needs of women, especially those who are pregnant. This retrospective chart review sought to describe the maternal and infant health outcomes of incarcerated women who received prenatal care while in an Arkansas prison.
Methods
Using a hospital-based electronic medical records (EMR) system, we examined the maternal health history and current pregnancy characteristics of 219 pregnant women who received prenatal care while incarcerated from June 2014 to May 2019. We also examined labor and delivery characteristics and postpartum and infant birth outcomes for the 146 women from this cohort who delivered a living child while still incarcerated.
Results
Most records indicated complex health histories with several chronic illnesses, mental health diagnoses, history of substance use, and lifetime medical complications. Despite comorbid illness, substance use disorder (SUD), trauma-history, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence was lower than expected. Previous and current obstetrical complications were common. Although the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission rate (41%) was high, few infants required extensive treatment intervention. Postpartum complications were rare; however, a small portion of women who gave birth in custody experienced severe complications and were re-admitted to the hospital post-discharge.
Conclusions
Incarcerated pregnant women and their infants are a marginalized population in great need of health care advocacy. To optimize maternal-infant outcomes, carceral agencies must recognize the health needs of incarcerated pregnant women and provide appropriate prenatal care. Expansion of carceral perinatal care to include screening for SUD and psychiatric symptoms (e.g., PTSD) and referral to appropriate care is highly encouraged. Policies related to NICU admission for non-medical reasons should be further examined.
Significance
What is already known on this subject?
Pregnant incarcerated women are at high risk for poor perinatal outcomes; however, knowledge of maternal and infant outcomes remains limited. Studies that exist are limited to a small number of outcomes and focus on immediate birth outcomes (e.g., prematurity, birthweight, NICU admission) with little data related to maternal and infant complications experienced during labor, delivery and postpartum, and infant diagnoses at delivery and discharge.
What this study adds?
Our study adds to what is known about the outcomes of incarcerated pregnant women by documenting their overall maternal health, previous and current pregnancy characteristics, and maternal and infant outcomes inclusive of the prenatal, labor and delivery, and postnatal periods.

N2  - Populations who are incarcerated have experienced disproportionately high coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) mortality rates compared to the general population. However, mortality rates by race/ethnicity from federal, state, and local carceral settings are largely unavailable due to unregulated reporting; therefore, racial/ethnic inequities have yet to be examined. We aimed to estimate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality rates among individuals incarcerated in U.S. state prisons by race and ethnicity (RE).
Public records requests to state Departments of Corrections were used to identify deaths from COVID-19 among incarcerated adults occurring from March 1-October 1, 2020. We requested race, ethnicity, and age specific data on deaths and custody populations; sufficient data to calculate age-adjusted rates were obtained for 11 state systems. Race and ethnic specific unadjusted deaths rates per 100,000 persons were calculated overall and by state, based on March 1, 2020 custody populations. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) compared aggregated age-adjusted death rates by race and ethnicity, with White individuals as the reference group.
Of all COVID-related deaths in U.S. prisons through October 2020, 23.35% (272 of 1165) were captured in our analyses. The average age at COVID-19 death was 63 years (SD = 10 years) and was significantly lower among Black (60 years, SD = 11 years) compared to White adults (66 years, SD = 10 years; p < 0.001). In age-standardized analysis, COVID-19 death rates were significantly higher among Black (RR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.25–2.99), Hispanic (RR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10–2.96) and those of Other racial and ethnic groups (RR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.01–6.67) when compared to White individuals.
Age-standardized death rates were higher among incarcerated Black, Hispanic and those of Other racial and ethnic groups compared to their White counterparts. Greater data transparency from all carceral systems is needed to better understand populations at disproportionate risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
Question: What are the COVID-19 mortality rates by race/ethnicity in state prisons?
Findings:•All COVID-19 deaths occurring in eleven U.S. state prisons from March to October 2020 were analyzed.•COVID-19 mortality rates were higher among incarcerated Black, Hispanic and those of Other RE groups compared to their White counterparts when adjusted for age.
Meaning:•These data show that racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 mortality were observed among incarcerated populations despite shared conditions of confinement.•Basic population level data to calculate the burden of COVID-19 by race/ethnicity were not readily available to the public.•Greater data transparency from carceral facilities is critical to understanding racial/ethnic inequities and supporting an appropriate public health response.

N2  - Many patients experiencing incarceration (PEI) in the United States (U.S.) have significant and complex medical conditions that require offsite consultation and hospitalization. Physicians in our academic medical system report that their education in caring for PEI is limited. We developed an online learning resource for physicians who care for PEI within our institution. Development included project planning, content development, iterative graphical design, feedback incorporation from key constituents, including individuals previously incarcerated, and module launch. The e-module was designed with a graphic user interface including video and case simulations. The curriculum includes background information on the U.S. carceral system, the basics of carceral health care, ethical considerations for community-based health care workers (introducing concepts of “dual loyalty” and examining patient privacy and autonomy for PEI), and policy and procedural considerations specific to our health care system. Future directions include disseminating the module to practicing physicians, advanced practice providers, and other allied health professionals (such as nursing, social work, and skilled therapists) and collecting feedback on user engagement. Institutions and groups wishing to improve care for this vulnerable patient population can implement training to address limitations in knowledge and confidence among staff and providers.

N2  - BackgroundCarceral facilities are high-risk settings for COVID-19 transmission. Little is known about the hidden burden of infection or practical barriers to infection control in these settings, especially in jails. There is also limited research on the mental health impacts of the pandemic among people living and working in carceral facilities. MethodsBetween July 8, 2020 and April 30, 2021, we performed SARS-CoV-2 rapid antibody testing and administered a questionnaire among residents and staff of four Northern California jails. We utilized multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic and carceral characteristics, to analyze factors associated with prior infection, including perceived likelihood of prior infection and access to new masks. We additionally assessed the implementation of, perceptions toward, and impacts of COVID-19 policies in practice. We engaged stakeholder representatives, including incarcerated individuals, to guide study design, procedures, and results interpretation. ResultsWe enrolled 788 jail residents and 380 jail staff. Nearly half of residents and two-thirds of staff who were antibody-positive had not previously tested positive for COVID-19. Among residents without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, antibody positivity was significantly associated with perceived likelihood of prior infection (adjusted OR = 8.9; 95% CI, 3.6-22.0). Residents who had flu-like illness in jail cited inadequate responses to reported illness and deterrents to symptom reporting, including fears of medical isolation and perceptions of medical neglect. Residents also disclosed deficient access to face masks, which was associated with antibody positivity (adjusted OR = 13.8, 95% CI, 1.8-107.0). Worsened mental health was pervasive among residents, attributed not only to fear of COVID-19 and unsanitary jail conditions but also to intensified isolation and deprivation due to pandemic restrictions on in-person visitation, programs, and recreation time. ConclusionCarceral settings present significant challenges to maintaining infection control and human rights. Custody officials should work diligently to transform the conditions of medical isolation, which could mitigate deterrents to symptom reporting. Furthermore, they should minimize use of restrictive measures like lockdowns and suspension of visitation that exacerbate the mental health harms of incarceration. Instead, custody officials should ensure comprehensive implementation of other preventive strategies like masking, testing, and vaccination, in conjunction with multisector efforts to advance decarceration.

N2  - This case study provides a critical discourse analysis of 121 letters of complaint and self‐advocacy authored by Natasha Keating, a trans woman incarcerated in two Australian male correctional facilities from 2000 to 2007. During her incarceration, Natasha experienced victimization, misgendering, microaggression, and institutional discrimination. Despite this, Natasha embodied and “fought” against the injustices she experienced, whilst seeking to speak for other trans incarcerated persons also silenced and treated with indifference, contributing to changes in the carceral system. This original case study analyzes the discursive strategies Natasha employed to construct and reclaim an affirming self‐identity through a deliberate campaign to effect social change and policy concessions within a system designed to curtail self‐determination. Through her empathic and impassioned letter‐writing approach, leveraging a military metaphor, this novel analysis showcases the significant implications her activism/agentism and determination had in naming and seeking to dismantle the systems of oppression trans incarcerated women experience.

N2  - Background
Research on carceral institutions and mortality finds that people in prisons and jails have a high risk of death immediately following release from custody and that while incarcerated, racial disparities in prisoner mortality counter observed death patterns among similarly situated non-incarcerated, demographic groups. Yet, many of these studies rely on data prior to the millennium, during the COVID-19 pandemic, or are relegated to a small number or select group of states. In this paper, we explore changes in mortality and life-expectancy among different demographic groups, before and after the Great Recession, across forty-four states that reported deaths in custody to the federal government between 2000 and 2014.
Methods
Drawing on a novel dataset created and curated, we calculate standard, age- specific quantities (death rates and life-expectancy) using period lifetable methods, disaggregated by race and sex, across three different periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014) for each state. Ordinary least squares regression models with state and year fixed-effects are included to examine state-level factors that may explain differences in prisoner mortality rates between 2000 and 2014. We also benchmark death counts reported to federal agencies with official state reports to cross-validate general mortality patterns.
Results
Among imprisoned men, age-specific trends in mortality have shifted across the three periods. Following the Great Recession and the push for criminal justice reforms, prisoner mortality dropped significantly and is concentrated at older ages among men during 2010-2014; the shifting pattern of mortality means that men age 30 in 2010-2014 had similar death rates as men in their early 20s during 2000-2004, representing a 7.5 year shift in age-specific mortality rates. Gains in the mortality decline were disproportionately experienced by Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic Black men, with the latter experiencing the greatest gains in life-expectancy of any demographic group. State-level violent crime rates are strongly and positively associated with prison mortality rates across states, net of socioeconomic and political factors. The large and significant disappearance of deaths in prisons from official data reported to federal agencies calls into question the narrowing gap in racial disparities among people in carceral facilities.
Conclusions
Legal decisions and social policies aimed at reducing mortality may be most effective in the short-run; however, the effects of these policy changes may fadeout over time. Research should clearly discern whether changes in mortality rates across states are due to diminished gains in social policies or increases in the disappearance (or underreporting) of deaths in custody. Understanding how and why gains in survivorship may stall is important for aligning health initiatives with social policy to facilitate maximal and consistent mortality declines for all demographic groups.

N2  - Psychotic disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) are a leading cause of morbidity and premature mortality and an overlooked health inequity in the United States. European data indicate inequities in incidence, severity, and treatment of psychotic disorders, particularly for Black communities, that appear to be primarily attributable to social adversities. The dominant US narrative is that any observed differences are primarily a result of clinician bias and misdiagnosis.
We propose that employing the framework of structural racism will prompt European and US research to converge and consider the multifaceted drivers of inequities in psychotic disorders among Black Americans. In particular, we describe how historical and contemporary practices of (1) racialized policing and incarceration, and (2) economic exploitation and disinvestment, which are already linked to other psychiatric disorders, likely contribute to risks and experiences of psychotic disorders among Black Americans.
This framework can inform new strategies to (1) document the role of racism in the incidence, severity, and treatment of psychotic disorders; and (2) dismantle how racism operates in the United States, including defunding the police, abolishing carceral systems, and redirecting funds to invest in neighborhoods, housing, and community-based crisis response and mental health care.

N2  - BackgroundIncarceration provides an opportunity for health interventions, including opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and prevention of opioid-related overdoses post-release. All FDA-approved forms of medication for OUD (MOUD) treatment were mandated in several Massachusetts jails in 2019, with some jails offering extended-release buprenorphine (XR-Bup). Little is known about patient perspectives on and experiences with XR-Bup in carceral settings.MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews in 2022 with community-dwelling people who received MOUD during a recent incarceration in a Massachusetts jail. We asked participants about their experiences with and perspectives on XR-Bup while in jail. Qualitative data were double-coded deductively and reviewed inductively to identify emergent themes, which were structured using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA).ResultsParticipants (n = 38) had a mean age of 41.5 years, were 86% male, 84% White, 24% Hispanic, and 95% continued to receive MOUD at the time of their interview, including 11% receiving XR-Bup. Participants who viewed XR-Bup favorably appreciated avoiding the taste of sublingual buprenorphine; avoiding procedural difficulties and indignities associated with daily dosing in carceral settings (e.g., mouth checks, stigmatizing treatment from correctional staff); avoiding daily reminders of their addiction; experiencing less withdrawal; having extra time for other activities, such as work; and reduction of diversion of MOUD within the jail setting. Participants who viewed XR-Bup less favorably preferred to maintain their daily dosing routine; liked daily time out of their housing unit; wanted to know what was "going into my body everyday"; and feared needles and adverse events. Participants also reported that jail clinicians used XR-Bup for patients who were previously caught diverting sublingual buprenorphine, suggesting limited patient participation in decision-making around XR-Bup initiation in some jails.ConclusionPeople who received MOUD in Massachusetts jails had both favorable and unfavorable views and experiences with XR-Bup. Understanding these preferences can inform protocols in jails that are considering implementation of XR-Bup treatment.

N2  - Background Little is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hepatitis C (HCV) screening efforts in carceral settings. We explored the impact of the pandemic on HCV screening in two of Quebec's largest provincial prisons.Methods Retrospective data of HCV-related laboratory tests between July 2018 and February 2022 at l'& Eacute;tablissement de d & eacute;tention de Montr & eacute;al (EDM) and l'& Eacute;tablissement de d & eacute;tention de Rivi & egrave;re-des-Prairies (EDRDP) were obtained. To examine the association between the pandemic and the number of HCV-antibody (HCV-Ab) tests, a three-level time period variable was created: pre-outbreak, outbreak, and post-outbreak. Negative binomial regression (with monthly admissions as an offset) was used to assess the change in HCV-Ab tests across time periods and by prisons. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.Results A total of 1,790 HCV-Ab tests were performed; 56 (3%) were positive. Among these, 44 (79%) HCV RNA tests were performed; 23 (52%) were positive. There was a significant decrease in HCV-Ab screening at EDM during the outbreak (aOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.17-0.48) and post-outbreak (aOR 0.49; 95% CI 0.35-0.69) periods, compared to the pre-outbreak period. There was no significant change in HCV-Ab screening at EDRDP during the outbreak (aOR 0.98; 95% CI 0.49-2.11) but a significant increase in HCV-Ab screening post-outbreak (aOR 1.66; 95% CI 1.04-2.72).Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected HCV screening at EDM but had minimal impact at EDRDP. To eliminate HCV from carceral settings, minimizing screening interruptions during future outbreaks and combined HCV/SARS-CoV-2 screening should be prioritized.

N2  - Marginalized groups (including people of Color and sexual minorities) have been over‐policed and specifically targeted based on their race/ethnicity and identity. The deleterious effects of over‐policing marginalized groups include overrepresentation in the carceral system, experiencing higher rates of violence from police, and extend to affect mental health and stress levels. This study examines police‐related stress among a U.S. national cohort of gay and bisexual men (collected in late 2020 and early 2021) and its association with race/ethnicity, age, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, income, and other characteristics of interest. Our results show that the odds of reporting extreme police‐related stress were 2.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] [2.08, 3.41]) times higher for Black individuals than for their White counterparts. Odds were also significantly greater for those who have experienced race‐based (odds ratio [OR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.81–2.82] or identity‐based discrimination (OR = 2.05, 95% CI [1.66, 2.54]). Our findings demonstrate variation in police‐related stress among a cohort of gay and bisexual men; with men of Color and low‐income men among the most affected by police‐related stress. For this population, police‐related stress should be considered for its potential deleterious effect on HIV vulnerability and reporting violent crimes to police (including intimate partner violence and hate crimes).
Highlights
Black and Latino/x gay and bisexual men were more likely to experience extreme police‐related stress.
Gay and bisexual men who experienced discrimination were more likely to report police‐related stress.
Police‐related stress may affect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vulnerability and reporting crimes among gay and bisexual men.

N2  - Women who are incarcerated give birth in community hospitals, but under conditions that differ dramatically from women who present from community settings. However, systematic examinations of the full breadth of possible restrictions imposed upon incarcerated women hospitalized for childbirth and recovery are lacking, limiting knowledge on how carceral status affects hospital practices for this population. To bridge this gap, we identified the electronic medical records of 180 women who gave birth in a community- based hospital while in custody of a state prison between June 2014 and July 2022 and extracted textual data related to care restrictions imposed during hospitalization for childbirth and recovery. We found that 45 records contained documentation of one or more atypical restrictions. Specific restrictions documented related to mother- infant contact (n=14), shackling (n=12), breastfeeding (n=10), infant- caregiver visitation (n=8), infant pictures (n=6), and health service access/involvement (n=3). Implications of restrictions are discussed.

N2  - This chapter considers how the state, carceral reformers, and technology companies shape discourse around prison visitation broadly and video visitation in particular that militates intimacy, particularly in the form of the "family," as a technology of racializing and gendering violence. Against claims that experiences and sites of visitation are inherent, albeit relative, spaces of rehabilitation and future substantial freedom, this chapter examines how the U.S. carceral-colonial regime strives to entrench and expand itself through the production and regulation of cisheteropatriarchal and racist kinship bonds at sites of visitation. Reading the discourse of visitation, this chapter argues that visitation functions as a form of biopolitical management of populations through the demographic category of "formerly incarcerated" and "family of the formerly incarcerated." In this way, carceral space tightens its totalizing grip on spaces ostensibly beyond the brick-and-mortar walls of the prison. The chapter concludes by examining aesthetic and activist attempts to use visitation to abolish the prison.

N2  - Background
Currently, there are more than two million people in prisons or jails, with nearly two-thirds meeting the criteria for a substance use disorder. Following these patterns, overdose is the leading cause of death following release from prison and the third leading cause of death during periods of incarceration in jails. Traditional quantitative methods analyzing the factors associated with overdose following incarceration may fail to capture structural and environmental factors present in specific communities. People with lived experiences in the criminal legal system and with substance use disorder hold unique perspectives and must be involved in the research process.
Objective
To identify perceived factors that impact overdose following release from incarceration among people with direct criminal legal involvement and experience with substance use.
Methods
Within a community-engaged approach to research, we used concept mapping to center the perspectives of people with personal experience with the carceral system. The following prompt guided our study: “What do you think are some of the main things that make people who have been in jail or prison more and less likely to overdose?” Individuals participated in three rounds of focus groups, which included brainstorming, sorting and rating, and community interpretation. We used the Concept Systems Inc. platform
groupwisdom
for our analyses and constructed cluster maps.
Results
Eight individuals (ages 33 to 53) from four states participated. The brainstorming process resulted in 83 unique factors that impact overdose. The concept mapping process resulted in five clusters: (1) Community-Based Prevention, (2) Drug Use and Incarceration, (3) Resources for Treatment for Substance Use, (4) Carceral Factors, and (5) Stigma and Structural Barriers.
Conclusions
Our study provides critical insight into community-identified factors associated with overdose following incarceration. These factors should be accounted for during resource planning and decision-making.

N2  - In France, recent data on the consumption of psychoactive substances (PASs) among women entering prison are virtually nonexistent. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of female entrants at Montluc prison in Lyon (France) and to estimate their PAS consumption.
Between June 1, 2004 and December 31, 2008, of 841 women entering the Lyon correctional facility, 535 had an entrance interview, conducted by a nurse, during which a questionnaire was systematically proposed; 306 detainees did not have this interview and could not be included in the study because of an immediate transfer to another prison or emergency hospitalization. Socioeconomic and incarceration characteristics, PAS consumption, as well as consumption level (occasional, regular, abusive or dependence) and psychological distress of the 535 interviewed detainees were systematically noted. This psychological distress was defined by the presence in the entrant talks or behavior suggesting clinical symptoms such as anxiety, depression, delusion, delirium, and mood or behavior disorders. Descriptive analysis was undertaken with the Chi2 test and Fisher's exact test for differences between the proportions observed.
The average age of the 534 responding detainees was 31.5years; 59.2% had had no ongoing professional activity in the 12months prior to incarceration, and 21.6% had already been imprisoned before; 37.5% of the entrants reported dependence on tobacco and 13.7% on alcohol; 6.6% reported regular, abusive use or dependence on cannabis, 20.4% on psychotropic medications, and 7.7% on other drugs (heroin, cocaine, synthetic drugs) in the 6months preceding their incarceration; 39.2% of the consumers at risk reported using at least two substances; 7.1% of detainees were on opioid substitution treatment. A multiple correspondence factor analysis was used to note specific characteristics of three groups of PAS consumers.
More frequent among young women detainees, overall PAS consumption was quite close to that of male entrants, was greater than in the general female population, and was very often accompanied by psychological distress. Effective screening upon entry into detention should be carried out so that female consumers can be offered psychological and/or psychiatric care adapted to a prison environment.
En France, les données récentes sur la consommation de substances psychoactives (SPA) chez les femmes entrant en prison sont quasi inexistantes. L’objectif de notre étude était de décrire les caractéristiques des femmes entrant à la prison Montluc de Lyon et d’estimer leur consommation de SPA.
Entre le 1er juin 2004 et le 31 décembre 2008, parmi les 841 femmes entrant à la prison de Lyon, 535 ont pu bénéficier d’un entretien d’arrivée mené par une infirmière lors duquel un questionnaire leur était systématiquement proposé ; 306 détenues n’ont pas pu obtenir cet entretien et n’ont pas pu être incluses dans l’étude en raison d’un transfert immédiat vers une autre prison ou d’une hospitalisation urgente. Les caractéristiques socioéconomiques et pénales, la consommation de SPA ainsi que le niveau de cette consommation (occasionnelle, régulière, abusive ou dépendance) et la souffrance psychique des 535 détenues interrogées étaient systématiquement notés. Cette souffrance psychique était définie par la présence dans le discours ou dans le comportement de signes évocateurs ou de symptômes cliniques tels que anxiété, dépression, hallucinations, délire et troubles de l’humeur ou du comportement. L’analyse descriptive a été réalisée à l’aide du test du Chi2 et du test exact de Fisher pour la significativité des différences de pourcentage observées.
L’âge moyen des 534 répondantes était de 31,5ans, 59,2 % n’avaient pas eu d’activité professionnelle continue dans les 12 mois précédant l’incarcération et 21,6 % avaient déjà été incarcérées ; 35,7 % des entrantes déclaraient une dépendance au tabac et 13,7 % à l’alcool, 6,6 % un usage régulier, abusif ou une dépendance au cannabis, 20,4 % aux médicaments psychotropes et 7,7 % aux autres drogues (héroïne, cocaïne, drogues de synthèse) dans les six mois précédant l’incarcération ; 39,2 % des consommatrices à risque déclaraient l’usage d’au moins deux produits ; 7,1 % des détenues étaient sous traitement de substitution aux opiacés. Une analyse factorielle des correspondances multiples a permis de définir et préciser les caractéristiques spécifiques de trois groupes de consommatrices de SPA.
Plus fréquentes chez les détenues jeunes, les consommations de SPA, assez proches de celles des entrants hommes, sont plus importantes qu’en population féminine générale et s’accompagnent très souvent d’une souffrance psychique : elles imposent un dépistage efficace dès l’entrée en détention afin de proposer aux femmes consommatrices une prise en charge psychologique et/ou psychiatrique adaptée au milieu carcéral.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Mass incarceration has been shown to be a force of racializations and class inequality in US life, but little literature has focused on the lives of prison guards. Highlighting the lived experiences of prison guards at two state maximum security prisons in Elmira, New York, a small multiracial city in central New York State, this article uses Cedric Robinson's notion of racial capitalism to show how prison expansion unfolds in New York State at the end of the twentieth century. Guard labor includes both the physical work of control and of basic social reproduction and is done by people who are connected to the cultures, histories, and political economies in which they were raised, what Elmirans often call one's “hometown.” I examine prison guards’ narratives of their racial encounters inside and outside the prison, their sense of their racialized selves, and their relationship to what they see as often boring, violent, and stigmatized work. I show how the expansion of the carceral state over the past forty years, the period most often referred to as mass incarceration, maintains Fordism's labor hierarchies in a retooled racialization: as jailer and jailed. [prisons, whiteness, carceral state, racial capitalism, post‐Fordism]
RESUMEN
El encarcelamiento masivo ha mostrado ser una fuerza de racialización y desigualdad de clase en la vida de los Estados Unidos, pero poca literatura se ha enfocado en las vidas de los guardianes de prisión. Resaltando las experiencias de vida de los guardianes de prisión en dos prisiones estatales de máxima seguridad en Elmira, Nueva York, una ciudad pequeña multirracial en el centro del estado de Nueva York, este artículo usa la noción de capitalismo racial de Cedric Robinson para mostrar cómo la expansión de prisiones se desarrolla en el estado de Nueva York a finales del siglo XX. La labor de guardián incluye tanto el trabajo físico de control como de reproducción social básica y es realizada por personas que están conectadas a las culturas, las historias, y las economías políticas en las cuales ellas fueron levantadas, que las de Elmira a menudo llaman la “ciudad donde uno se crio”. Examino las narrativas de los guardianes de prisión sobre sus encuentros raciales dentro y fuera de la prisión, su sentido de sí mismos como personas racializadas, y su relación con lo que ellos ven frecuentemente como trabajo aburridor, violento y estigmatizado. Muestro cómo la expansión del estado carcelario en los últimos cuarenta años, el período más a menudo referido como encarcelación masiva, mantiene unas jerarquías de labor del fordismo en una racialización reorganizada: como carcelero y encarcelado.

N2  - Psychology is grounded in the ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, that is, “do no harm.” Yet many have argued that psychology as a field is attached to carceral systems and ideologies that uphold the prison industrial complex (PIC), including the field of community psychology (CP). There have been recent calls in other areas of psychology to transform the discipline into an abolitionist social science, but this discourse is nascent in CP. This paper uses the semantic device of “algorithms” (e.g., conventions to guide thinking and decision‐making) to identify the areas of alignment and misalignment between abolition and CP in the service of moving us toward greater alignment. The authors propose that many in CP are already oriented to abolition because of our values and theories of empowerment, promotion, and systems change; our areas of misalignment between abolition and CP hold the potential to evolve. We conclude with proposing implications for the field of CP, including commitments to the belief that (1) the PIC cannot be reformed, and (2) abolition must be aligned with other transnational liberation efforts (e.g., decolonization).
Highlights
The prison industrial complex (PIC) is a White supremacist system of violence that needs to be abolished.
PIC abolition would replace systems of punishment and control with care and accountability.
Community psychology (CP) and abolition are aligned in commitments to social justice and systems change.
CP and abolition have misalignments, but they can be shifted.
Aligning with abolition will help CP follow the “decolonial turn” for which many are calling.

N2  - Purpose
We sought to identify trends and characteristics associated with the availability of tailored mental health services for individuals involved in the criminal justice system and ordered to treatment by a court, nationally in the US and by state.
Methods
We used National Mental Health Services Survey to identify outpatient mental health treatment facilities in the US (2016
n
 = 4744; 2018
n
 = 4626; 2020
n
 = 4869). We used clustered multiple logistic regression to identify changes over time as well as facility- and state-level factors associated with the availability of specialty court-ordered services.
Results
Slightly more than half of the outpatient mental health treatment facilities offered specialized services for individuals ordered to treatment by a court, with wide variation between states. Nationally, there was a significant increase in the odds of offering court-ordered treatment in 2020 compared to 2016 (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.06–1.27,
p
 < 0.01). Notable associations included offering integrated substance use treatment (versus none, aOR = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.70–3.22,
p
 < 0.0001) and offering trauma therapy (versus none, aOR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.85–2.27,
p
 < 0.0001).
Conclusion
The availability of mental health services for individuals ordered to treatment by a court is growing nationally but several states are lagging behind. Court ordered treatment is a promising strategy to improve health and reduce reliance on the carceral system as a healthcare provider. At the same time, we express caution around disparities within behavioral health courts and advocate for equity in access to incarceration alternatives.

N2  - Objectives. To describe 4 unique models of operationalizing wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in jails of graduated sizes and different architectural designs. Methods. We summarize how jails of Cook County, Illinois (average daily population [ADP] 6000); Fulton County, Georgia (ADP 3000); Middlesex County, Massachusetts (ADP 875); and Washington, DC (ADP 1600) initiated WBS between 2020 and 2023. Results. Positive signals for SARS-CoV-2 via WBS can herald a new onset of infections in previously uninfected jail housing units. Challenges implementing WBS included political will and realized value, funding, understanding the building architecture, and the need for details in the findings. Conclusions. WBS has been effective for detecting outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in different sized jails, those with both dorm- and cell-based architectural design.

N2  - Aim(s)
To assess barriers and facilitators to seeking inpatient psychiatric treatment among transgender and nonbinary people.
Design
Qualitative interview study.
Methods
Semi‐structured interviews were conducted from March 2019 to June 2022 with transgender and nonbinary people admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital in the United States during the past 5 years. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and constructed within a modified social‐ecological model of stigma. Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research were used for this study.
Results
Participants (N = 15) described barriers and facilitators across all three social‐ecological levels. i) Individual themes included distrust of the mental healthcare system, feeling unsafe, loss of autonomy, minimizing one's own mental health needs, and feelings of accountability to others. ii) Interpersonal themes included: lack of support for transgender/nonbinary identity, limited transgender/nonbinary knowledge among mental healthcare professionals, and allyship. iii) Structural themes included: carceral setting, financial costs, and availability of non‐profit treatment options.
Conclusion
Multi‐level themes were identified as barriers and facilitators to seeking inpatient psychiatric care for transgender and nonbinary people, providing opportunities among inpatient settings to improve care delivery and engagement. Greater health equity can be achieved by addressing barriers to care.
Implications
Incorporating inclusive and affirming practices in inpatient psychiatric services presents an opportunity to reduce barriers to seeking care.
Impact
The present study describes the experiences of transgender and nonbinary people as they determine whether to voluntarily seek inpatient psychiatric treatment. This perspective allows nurses, health systems, and policymakers to integrate transgender and nonbinary people's needs to improve healthcare delivery.
Patient/Public Contribution
Transgender and nonbinary participants were recruited in collaboration with community organizations. Members of the transgender and nonbinary community participated in study design development and analysis and were part of the study team.

N2  - Importance Agonist medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), buprenorphine and methadone, in carceral settings might reduce the risk of postrelease opioid overdose but are uncommonly offered. In April 2019, the Massachusetts Department of Correction (MADOC), the state prison system, provided buprenorphine for incarcerated individuals in addition to previously offered injectable naltrexone. Objective To evaluate postrelease outcomes after buprenorphine implementation. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study with interrupted time-series analysis used linked data across multiple statewide data sets in the Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse stratified by sex due to differences in carceral systems. Eligible participants were individuals sentenced and released from a MADOC facility to the community. The study period for the male sample was January 2014 to November 2020; for the female sample, January 2015 to October 2019. Data were analyzed between February 2022 and January 2024. Exposure April 2019 implementation of buprenorphine during incarceration. Main Outcomes and Measures Receipt of MOUD within 4 weeks after release, opioid overdose, and all-cause mortality within 8 weeks after release, each measured as a percentage of monthly releases who experienced the outcome. Segmented linear regression analyzed changes in outcome rates after implementation. Results A total of 15 225 individuals were included. In the male sample there were 14 582 releases among 12 688 individuals (mean [SD] age, 35.0 [10.8] years; 133 Asian and Pacific Islander [0.9%], 4079 Black [28.0%], 4208 Hispanic [28.9%], 6117 White [41.9%]), a rate of 175.7 releases per month; the female sample included 3269 releases among 2537 individuals (mean [SD] age, 34.9 [9.8] years; 328 Black [10.0%], 225 Hispanic [6.9%], 2545 White [77.9%]), a rate of 56.4 releases per month. Among male participants at 20 months postimplementation, the monthly rate of postrelease buprenorphine receipt was higher than would have been expected under baseline trends (21.2% vs 10.6% of monthly releases; 18.6 additional releases per month). Naltrexone receipt was lower than expected (1.0% vs 6.0%; 8.8 fewer releases per month). Monthly rates of methadone receipt (1.4%) and opioid overdose (1.8%) were not significantly different than expected. All-cause mortality was lower than expected (1.9% vs 2.8%; 1.5 fewer deaths per month). Among female participants at 7 months postimplementation, buprenorphine receipt was higher than expected (31.6% vs 9.5%; 12.4 additional releases per month). Naltrexone receipt was lower than expected (3.4% vs 7.2%) but not statistically significantly different. Monthly rates of methadone receipt (1.1%), opioid overdose (4.8%), and all-cause mortality (1.6%) were not significantly different than expected. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of state prison releases, postrelease buprenorphine receipt increased and naltrexone receipt decreased after buprenorphine became available during incarceration.

N2  - BackgroundIncarcerated individuals in carceral facilities demonstrate an elevated prevalence of chronic disease conditions which are likely to persist post-release. Healthcare providers may not be trained on how exposure to incarceration may influence patient health outcomes and patient-provider communication.ObjectiveTo examine the self-perceived preparedness of healthcare providers to interview patients regarding history of incarceration and the potential related health consequences.DesignThis cross-sectional study consisted of a web-based self-administered questionnaire distributed via email to a random sample of healthcare providers in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.ParticipantsIn total, 400 healthcare providers were invited to participate; 114 respondents completed the survey, of which 26% were medical doctors (n=30), 41% were physician assistants (n=47), and 32% were nurse practitioners (n=37).Main MeasuresUnderstanding healthcare provider training in caring for formerly incarcerated patients, current treatment practices and confidence caring for patients who have experienced incarceration, and implications for clinical care.Key ResultsOf 114 respondents, 73% reported that they currently care for formerly incarcerated patients. However, only 8% received specialized training for the care of formerly incarcerated patients. While most respondents did not ask their patients about prior history of incarceration (81%), when asked about comfortability in doing so, 60% reported low levels of comfort. Most providers (77%) reported high agreement that incarceration impacted health, with 54% reporting that it led to significant healthcare access barriers, but 64% reported low confidence levels in addressing the needs of formerly incarcerated patients.ConclusionsHealthcare workers recognized incarceration as a detrimental health exposure. However, providers reported low levels of confidence in understanding and addressing the unique needs of patients who experienced incarceration. Findings support the need for further training regarding how to address the needs of formerly incarcerated patients, which would support efforts towards achieving equitable healthcare.

N2  - This agrarian geography of Kentucky begins on the streets of the state's largest city, in the throes of antiracist struggle. It tracks the state's lingering colonial settler power dynamics through the racism of plantation, extraction, and carceral geographies. It then traces how resistance to these exploitations take root in place-based agri-food initiatives unfolding through urban-rural solidarity against white supremacist policing, prison systems, labor exploitation, and extractivism. It begins with a brief overview of the scale of reference of Kentucky itself. Situating the state entails addressing the trauma and topophilia (love of landscape) of its agrarian past and present. It draws upon bell hooks’ literary invocations of Kentucky-based agrarian visions, as well as place-based political ecology scholarship (seven years of Kentucky Agrarian Questions practitioner panels at the Dimensions of Political Ecology Conference at University of Kentucky). Following Black and abolitionist geographies, this agrarian geography traces rural and urban shared struggles for food sovereignty, environmental justice, and liberation from racism of carceral systems. It introduces Kentucky grassroots projects connecting and uniting rural and urban struggles against carceral violence and the racism therein, such as Hood to the Holler (a political initiative emerging from Black Lives Matter mobilizations for Breonna Taylor). The essay ends with reflections on the political-ecological contradictions and imperative of working through and beyond a settler-colonial-state scale of reference like Kentucky. To extricate from and dismantle plantation modes and carceral legacies, abolitionist agrarian geographies recover the reality of Black and Indigenous agrarian history, presence, and futures. As such, rooted in place-based reckoning, resistance, and responsibility, they offer hope.

N2  - What are the possibilities for multispecies justice? How do social justice struggles intersect with the lives of animals, plants, and other creatures? Leading thinkers in anthropology, geography, philosophy, speculative fiction, poetry, and contemporary art answer these questions from diverse grounded locations. In America, Indigenous peoples and prisoners are decolonizing multispecies relations in unceded territory and carceral landscapes. Small justices are emerging in Tanzanian markets, near banana plantations in the Philippines, and in abandoned buildings of Azerbaijan as people navigate relations with feral dogs, weeds, rats, and pesticides. Conflicts over rights of nature are intensifying in Colombia's Amazon. Specters of justice are emerging in India, while children in Micronesia memorialize extinct bird species. Engaging with ideas about environmental justice, restorative justice, and other species of justice, The Promise of Multispecies Justice holds open the possibility of flourishing in multispecies worlds, present and to come.Contributors.

N2  - Objective Racial discrimination and racial identity may compete to influence incarceration risk. We estimated the predicted days incarcerated in a national US sample of Black, Latino/Latina, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals. Methods We used the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (n = 14,728) to identify individual incarceration history. We used zero-inflated Poisson regression to predict the number of days incarcerated across racial discrimination and racial identity scores. Results Racial discrimination and identity varied between races/ethnicities, such that racial discrimination exposure was highest among Hispanic individuals, while racial identity was highest among Black individuals. Racial discrimination was positively associated with days incarcerated among Black individuals (beta = 0.070, p<0.0001) and AI/AN individuals (beta = 0.174, p<0.000). Racial identity was negatively associated with days incarcerated among Black individuals (beta = -0.147, p<0.0001). The predicted number of days incarcerated was highest among Black individuals (130 days) with high discrimination scores. Conclusion Racial discrimination and racial identity were associated with days incarcerated, and the association varied by racial/ethnic sub-group. Informed by these findings, we suggest that intervention strategies targeting incarceration prevention should be tailored to the unique experiences of racial/ethnic minoritized individuals at the greatest risk. Policies aimed at reversing mass incarceration should consider how carceral systems fit within the wider contexts of historical racism, discrimination, and structural determinants of health.

N2  - Current U.S. environmental management paradigms default to enforcement mechanisms that feed into the prison industrial complex, such as fines and jailing. To avoid contributing to and reinforcing mass incarceration and militarism, environmental management systems need to be transformed towards non-carceral forms. Additionally, working towards Indigenous sovereignty and decolonization, requires the strengthening of Indigenous relations with and governance over the land under the respective paradigms of Indigenous communities. This paper uses Hawaiʻi state fisheries law and programmatic efforts to address a central question: What is the extent and nature of carceral norms within conventional environmental management systems and how do they affect management outcomes? The study examines the current fisheries enforcement scheme in Hawaiʻi, tracing the embedded logic of carcerality, the degree to which ultimate sources of harm are addressed, and the concentration of governing powers. The results highlight how current fisheries enforcement is insufficient in caring for the seascape and, through its carceral approach, contributes to social injustices, particularly for Kānaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians). Additionally, this paper demonstrates how current efforts in Hawaiʻi – Community-Based Subsistence Fisheries Areas (CBSFAs), the ʻAha Moku system, and the Makai Watch Program – attempt to empower communities, but ultimately keep enforcement powers centralized within the State, thus perpetuating dependency on the criminal justice system. This study ends with a discussion on how future decarceral environmental governance systems could be designed to center Hawaiian relations & paradigms, particularly by prioritizing the values of re-education, rematriation, and restoration.

N2  - Contact with the carceral state-ranging from police stops to prison time-is a frequent experience in the United States, particularly in communities marginalized on the basis of race and class. In recent years, political scientists have sought to measure the impacts of these encounters on individuals' and communities' political engagement. This review describes the main sources of evidence in this literature and what we learn from them. I present a series of stylized facts about the carceral state and political behavior, highlighting places where we know a great deal (such as the relative underrepresentation of people with criminal convictions among voters) and places where more work is needed (such as nonvoting participation and community spillovers). Then, I discuss policy proposals that seek to mitigate the political impacts of the carceral state, and what is and is not yet known about what they might accomplish.

N2  - Background Carceral facilities are epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing incarcerated people at an elevated risk of COVID-19 infection. Due to the initial limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, all states have developed allocation plans that outline a phased distribution. This study uses document analysis to compare the relative prioritization of incarcerated people, correctional staff, and other groups at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and morbidity.
Methods and findings We conducted a document analysis of the vaccine dissemination plans of all 50 US states and the District of Columbia using a triple-coding method. Documents included state COVID-19 vaccination plans and supplemental materials on vaccine prioritization from state health department websites as of December 31, 2020. We found that 22% of states prioritized incarcerated people in Phase 1, 29% of states in Phase 2, and 2% in Phase 3, while 47% of states did not explicitly specify in which phase people who are incarcerated will be eligible for vaccination. Incarcerated people were consistently not prioritized in Phase 1, while other vulnerable groups who shared similar environmental risk received this early prioritization. States' plans prioritized in Phase 1: prison and jail workers (49%), law enforcement (63%), seniors (65+ years, 59%), and long-term care facility residents (100%).
Conclusions This study demonstrates that states' COVID-19 vaccine allocation plans do not prioritize incarcerated people and provide little to no guidance on vaccination protocols if they fall under other high-risk categories that receive earlier priority. Deprioritizing incarcerated people for vaccination misses a crucial opportunity for COVID-19 mitigation. It also raises ethical and equity concerns. As states move forward with their vaccine distribution, further work must be done to prioritize ethical allocation and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to incarcerated people.

N2  - ABSTRACT
It is critical to address hepatitis C virus (HCV) in carceral settings to achieve worldwide elimination of the virus. We describe New Mexico's (NM) experience expanding HCV treatment in state prisons, supplemented with Project ECHO (ECHO; virtual mentorship through guided practice) and the NM Peer Education Program (NMPEP). We describe how using these programs may be a model for expanding treatment in prisons globally. ECHO, NM Corrections Department (NMCD) and Wexford Health Services (WHS) collaborate to treat HCV in state prisons and increase HCV knowledge among incarcerated persons using NMPEP. Each person arriving in prison is tested for HCV and those with active infection receive baseline labs, which are reviewed. Patients not meeting criteria for simplified treatment are presented to ECHO for expert guidance. Otherwise, patients are treated by WHS without consultation. NMPEP provides patient‐to‐patient education in prisons, addressing HCV myths and exploring treatment refusals. From December 2020 to June 2023, 3603 people had HCV viremia. In this study, 1685 people started treatment: 1280 were treated using the simplified algorithm and 405 were presented to ECHO. Of the 988 people who completed treatment and had sustained virologic response (SVR) labs drawn, 89.2% achieved SVR (i.e., cure). Most of the 107 people who did not achieve SVR had presumed reinfection. NMPEP trained 148 peer educators who educated 3832 peers about HCV prevention and treatment. HCV treatment in prisons can be expanded by implementing simplified treatment algorithms, use of the ECHO model for patients with advanced disease and peer education.

N2  - People incarcerated in US prisons have been disproportionately harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic. That prisons are such efficient superspreading environments can be attributed to several known factors: small, communal facilities where people are confined for prolonged periods of time; poor ventilation; a lack of non-punitive areas for quarantine/medical isolation; and staggeringly high numbers of people experiencing incarceration, among others. While health organizations have issued guidance on preventing and mitigating COVID-19 infection in carceral settings, little is known about if, when, and how recommendations have been implemented. We examined factors contributing to containment of one of the first California prison COVID-19 outbreaks and remaining vulnerabilities using an adapted multi-level determinants framework to systematically assess infectious disease risk in carceral settings.
Case study employing administrative data; observation; and informal discussions with: people incarcerated at the prison, staff, and county public health officials.
Outbreak mitigation efforts were characterized by pre-planning (e.g., designation of ventilated, single-occupancy quarantine) and a quickly mobilized inter-institutional response that facilitated systematic, voluntary rapid testing. However, several systemic- and institutional-level vulnerabilities were unaddressed hindering efforts and posing significant risk for future outbreaks, including insufficient decarceration, continued inter-facility transfers, incomplete staff cohorting, and incompatibility between built environment features (e.g., dense living conditions) and public health recommendations.
Our adapted framework facilitates systematically assessing prison-based infectious disease outbreaks and multi-level interventions. We find implementing some recommended public health strategies may have contributed to outbreak containment. However, even with a rapidly mobilized, inter-institutional response, failure to decarcerate created an overreliance on chance conditions. This left the facility vulnerable to future catastrophic outbreaks and may render standard public health strategies - including the introduction of effective vaccines - insufficient to prevent or contain those outbreaks.

In this chapter, we return to our sample of specific grievances filed by California prisoners, which include the official responses they received. Combined with our interview data, these written grievances reveal a great deal about how people in different institutional locations perceive law and engage in legal practices, and how these perceptions and practices shift with changes in venue and

N2  - This article explores the making of carceral citizenship in Guatemala through an ethnographic analysis of la talacha - informal prison taxation schemes. Taxation is a key technology of citizenship. Tax enforcement mechanisms, the distribution of tax burdens, citizens' willingness to pay, and their expectations of what they should get in return all make taxation an essential lens through which to understand state formation and citizens' perceptions of and relations with one another. In Guatemala, where organized crime competes with and subsumes state institutions in ways that profoundly impact everyone, the state is only one of many entities claiming the right to tax, at turns competing and colluding with its underworld. These blurred dynamics are hyper-distilled in the country's prison system, where state-prisoner networks tax the imprisoned population in the name of collective survival and elite profits. Based on extended ethnographic fieldwork behind bars, I show how la talacha sets the terms of carceral citizenship by organizing prisoner-state co-governance, reifying the prison's socioeconomic hierarchies, and shaping inmates' relation-ships with the world beyond the prison. Keywords: Taxation, incarceration, citizenship, prison, Guatemala. Este articulo explora la construction de la ciudadania carcelaria en Guatemala a traves de un analisis etnografico de la talacha: esquema informal de tributacion carcelaria. La fiscalidad es una tecnologia clave de la ciudadania. Los mecanismos de aplicacion de impuestos, la distribucion de las cargas fiscales, la disposicion de los ciudadanos a pagar y sus expectativas de lo que deberian obtener a cambio hacen de la fiscalidad una lente esencial a traves de la cual entender la formacion del Estado y las percepciones de los ciudadanos y las relaciones entre ellos. En Guatemala, donde el crimen organizado compite con las instituciones estatales y las subsume en formas que afectan profundamente a todos, el Estado es solo una de las muchas entidades que reclaman el derecho a tributar, compitiendo y confabulando a su vez con el hampa. Estas dinamicas difusas se hiperdestilan en el sistema penitenciario del pais, donde las redes entre el Estado y los presos gravan a la poblacion reclusa en nombre de la supervivencia colectiva y los beneficios de las elites. Basandome en un extenso trabajo de campo etnografico entre rejas, muestro como la talacha establece los terminos de la ciudadania carcelaria organizando el cogobierno entre presos y Estado, reificando las jerarquias socio-economicas de la prision y configurando las relaciones de los reclusos con el mundo mas alla de la carcel. Palabras clave: Fiscalidad, encarcelamiento, ciudadania, carcel, Guatemala.

N2  - Carceral settings in the United States have been the source of many single site COVID-19 outbreaks. Quarantine is a strategy used to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in correctional settings, and specific quarantine practices differ state to state. To better understand how states are using quarantine in prisons, we reviewed each state’s definition of quarantine and compared each state’s definition to the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) definition and recommendations for quarantine in jails and prisons. Most prison systems, 45 of 53, define quarantine, but definitions vary widely. No state published definitions of quarantine that align with all CDC recommendations, and only 9 states provide quarantine data. In these states, the highest recorded quarantine rate occurred in Ohio in May 2020 at 843 per 1,000. It is necessary for prison systems to standardize their definitions of quarantine and to utilize quarantine practices in accordance with CDC recommendations. In addition, data transparency is needed to better understand the use of quarantine and its effectiveness at mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks in carceral settings.

N2  - Critical scholarship on the carceral reifies two main pillars of critical thought—phenomenology and governmentality. In this study of shifting carceral logics and experiences concerning Indigenous peoples in Canada, we borrow from these traditions and also challenge their centrality in prison studies. We argue that the prison is the new reserve, and use that argument as a vehicle to illustrate the influence of less recognized forms of thought within critical prison studies—especially post-colonial and Indigenous scholarship. It is through these varied lenses that we show the paradox of Indigenizing punishment that at once disavows the further incarceration of Indigenous peoples and sets out deliberate strategies to Indigenize the carceral.

N2  - The Department of Correctional Services Policy on the management of HIV and AIDS for offenders include voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) for HIV as one of the priorities in the rehabilitation of inmates. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with the utilisation of VCT services in the correctional centres in terms of level of satisfaction, their experiences and expectations, and motivating factors and barriers for VCT utilisation at Losperfontein Correctional Centre, South Africa. This was a case control study (cases being those who underwent testing and controls those who did not) examining predictors of HIV VCT utilisation among 200 male adult sentenced inmates serving medium and maximum sentences. Results indicate that a poor health system (OR=0.34, 95%CI: 0.23 - 0.50) was inversely associated with HIV testing acceptance in prison, while age, educational level, population group, marital status, length of incarceration and access to HIV testing in prison were not associated with HIV testing acceptance in prison. Half of the participants (50%) agreed that VCT services are accessible and are promoted at their correctional centre. Most were satisfied with different components of VCT services, ranging from 79% (fair to very good) for 'the way he/she received you' to 62% 'clarified all your concerns'. This study demonstrated some challenges and benefits to the field of health promotion and HIV prevention in the correctional centres especially with regard to VCT services.

N2  - People who live and work In carcera! settings are at high risk for COVID-19.1 As of September 30, 2022, at least 622 968 people incarcerated in US prisons and 230168 staff members had been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 3185 had died.2 Compared with rates among the general population, average COVID-19 case rates in state and federal prisons are five times higher3 and mortality rates are at least double.4,5 Likewise, communities that are near correctional facilities have higher rates of COVID-19.6Carceral systems, however, have not been fully integrated into public health responses to the pandemic. Few local governments have incorporated jails and prisons into their strategies for COVID-19 response and preparedness.7 The World Health Organization's recent comprehensive framework for COVID-19 response recommends that all countries conduct a substantive equity and inclusion analysis to inform programming, which should rely on "meaningful participation, collaboration, and consultation with subpopulations experiencing poverty and social exclusion."8 Yet, the bulk of what has been written on prisons during this pandemic has been based on an external "expert" perspective, not grounded in the perspective of people who live and work in these environments.We report on lessons learned in the first two years of the pandemic that were gleaned from a unique partnership with three carceral systems and based on 100 interviews we conducted with incarcerated people, correctional workers, and medical staff. They point to unique structural and operational challenges that carceral facilities face in prioritizing the goal of COVID-19 mitigation and highlight strategies that may improve pandemic preparedness. The methods of our study that generated these findings can be viewed in the Appendix (available as a supplement to the online version of this article at https://ajph.org). From this work, five dominant themes emerged that provide an "on-the-ground" perspective of living through COVID-19 in carceral settings and center the voices of those incarcerated and working in carceral spaces to capture the complexity of COVID-19 prevention and mitigation.

N2  - BackgroundPeople face numerous barriers to reentry and community integration following incarceration, and these obstacles manifest themselves as barriers to economic stability, housing security, healthcare, community acceptance, and educational attainment, ultimately leading to poor health. This study aims to understand healthcare needs of reentrants post release within the unique political and service context of Miami Dade County, FL, and seeks to uncover the structural facilitators and barriers to sustaining health during reentry.MethodsWe report on a subset of data from a larger reentry asset mapping project. We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis based on 12 semi-structured interviews with community stakeholders, including reentrants who were released in the past year (n = 5) and with community providers who have provided support services to returning citizens for at least one year (n = 7). Narratives were coded through an iterative process using NVivo software and were analyzed using the general inductive approach.ResultsThree themes emerged from the analysis: (1) social and structural barriers and facilitators to health during reentry, (2) challenges with medical care following release, and (3) long-term impacts of receiving poor healthcare in prison. Reentrants describe the carceral environment as non-conducive to health and cite an urgent need for systemic change within correctional institutions to promote their well-being. Respondents identified substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, trauma informed therapy, and chronic disease management as the primary healthcare needs of reentrants, and cite social support, stable housing, education, and employment as the key social and structural needs upon release.ConclusionThis study identifies prevalent resource gaps in Miami Dade County during reentry. Respondents advocate for more inclusive governmental housing programs, Medicaid expansion, and more holistic reentry programs to support reentrants. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to health during reentry can inform future interventions to better support reentrants in their transition post-incarceration.

N2  - Correctional officers are critical members of the prison community. However, scholarship rarely considers how correctional officers contribute to prison outcomes instead largely focusing on importation (individual) and deprivation (organizational) factors related to the incarcerated population. This is also true regarding how scholars and practitioners approach suicide committed by incarcerated people, one of the leading causes of death in US carceral institutions. Using quantitative data from confinement facilities across the United States, this study answers the research question: What is the relationship between prison suicide rates and correctional officer gender? Results show that deprivation factors (variables related to the carceral environment) influence prison suicide. Additionally, gender diversity among correctional officers reduces the rate of prison suicide. Implications for future research and practice and limitations of the study are also discussed.

N2  - Objectives
The number of incarcerated women in the United States has risen exponentially. Many are of childbearing age with 3-4% being pregnant at intake. Despite the need for comprehensive pregnancy-related health care in prisons and jails, there is no oversight that requires adherence to the established standards. The objective of this study was to assess prison and jail pregnancy policies and practices with an emphasis on restraint use and compliance with anti-shackling legislation.
Methods
We conducted a survey of 22 state prisons and six jails, including the five largest jails, from 2016–2017 regarding pregnancy policies and practices including restraint use, prenatal care, delivery and birth, and other pregnancy accommodations. We compared reported restraint policies to state legislation at the time of the survey.
Results
Data indicate that pregnancy policies and services in prisons and jails vary and compliance inconsistencies with anti-shackling legislation exist. A third of the prisons and half of the jails did not have accredited health care services. All study facilities provided prenatal vitamins and most provided supplemental snacks. Most facilities stationed an officer inside the hospital room during labor and delivery, but nearly one-third of facilities did not require a female-identifying officer.
Conclusions for practice
Limited oversight and standardization of carceral health care and accommodations for pregnant people lead to variability in prisons and jails. Prisons and jails should adopt and implement standards of care guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of pregnant people who have unique healthcare needs. Incarcerated pregnant people should be viewed as expectant parents in need of comprehensive health care, rather than as criminals who forfeited their right to a safe, respectful, and humane childbirth.

N2  - Disabled people are disproportionately incarcerated and segregated from society through a variety of institutions. Still, the links between disability and incarceration are underexplored, limiting understanding of how carceral institutions punish and contribute to the social exclusion of disabled people. Using data from the 2016 Survey of Prison Inmates, we estimated disability prevalence in state and federal prisons, assessing disparities by race, ethnicity, and sex, and we examined inequities in previous residence in other "punitive" and "therapeutic" institutions. Sixty-six percent of incarcerated people self-reported a disability, with Black, Hispanic, and multiracial disabled men especially overrepresented in prisons. Compared with nondisabled incarcerated people, disabled incarcerated people were more likely to have previously resided in other institutions, such as juvenile detention facilities and psychiatric hospitals. Together, our findings advance the understanding of disability in carceral institutions, highlighting the need for policy interventions redressing the mechanisms contributing to the high incarceration risks of disabled people and the disabling nature of prisons and other carceral institutions.

N2  - Objective: Early exposure to drug use and sexual abuse may contribute to later substance use, causing downstream effects on sexual and pregnancy-related behaviors. We applied the life course perspective to qualitative interview findings conducted with women with criminal legal involvement to explore connections between participants' early exposure to drugs and childhood sexual abuse with subsequent engagement with substance use and sexual and reproductive behaviors. Method: We analyzed semistructured interviews with 33 racially diverse women with criminal legal involvement, Ages 18-65, who were recruited from a community organization in the Midwestern United States to explore their experiences and perspectives on factors that influenced their substance use and reproductive health behaviors. We used a modified grounded theory approach and retroactively applied the life course perspective model to inform and organize our data. Results: Fifteen participants described exposure to substances and/or sexual abuse at a young age which played a role in influencing later life behaviors involving substance use and sexual and reproductive health. For some participants, the accumulation of experiences further contributed to shared pregnancy behaviors and outcomes including unexpected and rapid repeat pregnancies and difficulty abstaining from drug use while pregnant. Conclusions: Early life experiences may influence later life sexual and reproductive health behaviors. These experiences must be considered when engaging with women in patient-centered and trauma-informed ways in settings where they seek care including carceral facilities, obstetrics and gynecology and primary care clinics, and substance use disorder treatment programs.
Public Health Significance Statement
Early life experiences of childhood sexual abuse and exposure to drug use can impact future sexual and reproductive health behaviors and need to be considered by health care professionals who provide care to women with a history of criminal legal involvement and substance use.

N2  - BackgroundHarm reduction, when applied to drug use, prioritizes improving patient-centered health outcomes and reducing drug-related harm. In order for harm reduction strategies to be adopted by people who inject drugs (PWID), they need to be promoted, accessible, and accepted in that population and the community-at-large. While PWID face stigma at multiple levels, less is known about how stigma influences uptake and acceptance of harm reduction services and strategies among PWID.ObjectiveWe aim to characterize the stigmatizing experiences PWID have had related to harm reduction and the role of stigma in influencing their acceptance and adoption of harm reduction services and strategies.DesignA qualitative study using in-person, semi-structured interviews.ParticipantsWe recruited hospitalized participants, age 18 and over, with a history of injection drug use.ApproachWe developed an interview guide asking about various aspects of stigma and participants' experiences with naloxone, syringe service programs, fentanyl test strips, HIV and hepatitis C testing, and any other harm reduction strategies. Key themes were generated using a thematic analysis. We reached thematic saturation at 16 participants.Key ResultsPWID reported multi-level stigma related to harm reduction from themselves, the public, the healthcare system, and the legal and carceral systems. Themes were grouped into four main categories: internalized, interpersonal, intervention, and structural stigma. Stigma across all of these domains negatively impacted the ability of PWID to access harm reduction resources. Positive, non-stigmatizing experiences from others, such as syringe service programs and peer navigators, countered historically negative experiences and promoted greater education and comfort about using harm reduction resources among PWID.ConclusionsTo expand the reach of harm reduction services, it is critical to develop interventions that can reduce the stigma against PWID and harm reduction.

N2  - Aims To identify implementation barriers and facilitators to the adoption and implementation of programs that provide opioid agonist treatments (OAT) with methadone and buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder in jails and prisons in the United States. Design Qualitative analysis: semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematic analyses of transcripts and notes were performed using a hybrid inductive/deductive coding approach. Setting Jails and prisons in the United States. Participants From August 2019 to January 2020, we conducted 20 key informant interviews with 35 individuals representing 19 carceral systems that both initiate and maintain OAT. Measurements Interviews covered four domains: (1) program adoption; (2) policy influence on implementation; (3) program structure; and (4) program outcomes. Findings Stigma among staff, particularly medical staff, challenged program adoption, but reduced over time as staff were exposed to the program. Regulations on OAT dispensation, such as licensing requirements and prescribing limits, were key challenges to program implementation and shaped program structure. Dispensing medication required significant staff, time and space. Facilities were further challenged to overcome stigma and concerns about diversion, as OAT medication is often treated as contraband in carceral settings. Some systems deviated from evidence-based treatment by limiting OAT dosage to low levels, requiring counseling for participation and requiring detoxification before medication initiation. Despite these challenges, early adopters felt strongly that other jails and prisons in the United States should provide OAT and that legislation and litigation may soon force OAT expansion in these carceral settings. Conclusions Despite identifying regulatory and logistical challenges, early adopters of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) programs in US jails and prisons demonstrate that OAT programs can successfully be implemented in carceral settings with tailoring to the specific context.

N2  - In this paper we use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how death investigations in Los Angeles County jails disproportionately naturalize death among Black and Latino incarcerated people. Our study is based on an assessment of 58 autopsies, coroner investigator narratives, and toxicology reports produced between 2009 and 2018. We found that the Medical Examiner frequently arrived at natural or undetermined death determinations that minimized the culpability of carceral staff for loss of life that occurred within county jail. In our dataset, Black people were disproportionately classified as natural. Undetermined deaths were almost exclusively Latino. More than 75% of the cases in our study were deaths that occurred before standing trial. Our findings reveal how biomedical knowledge about incarcerated Black and Latino people is used to erase the life‐diminishing effects of punishment, neglect, and maltreatment that are central to the project of mass incarceration.

N2  - This article centres the everyday resistance practices by illegalised migrants contained in EU hotspots in Greece. Set against the regime of violent abandonment governing these carceral spaces, the article draws on ethnographic research in the Aegean archipelago to explore how resistance is enacted, experienced, and suppressed. The analysis foregrounds three distinct tactics of resistance - insubordination, insurrection, occupation - whereby migrants, individually and collectively, seek to disrupt carceral mechanisms. By shifting the analytical focus to migrants' often barely visible dissenting practices, the article sheds new light on how modalities of bio/necropolitical power and resistance intersect in the everyday workings of the EU hotspots. It reveals how migrants transform these spaces into stages of (infra)political struggle against forced confinement, even if they are unable to fundamentally weaken the hotspot regime as such. The article concludes that attending to migrants' everyday resistance practices, however fragile, fragmented, and fleeting, is critical. These practices not only unmask the racialised violence that resides at the core of the hotspot regime but its inability to fully contain migrants' desire for autonomous movement.

N2  - ABSTRACT
This article examines the forms of intergenerational kinship and care work that Black men perform within and beyond US prisons. First, I offer a historical conceptualization of domestic warfare as a multilayered process that targets Black radical activism, social/familial life, and the interiority of Black subjectivity. I argue that the rupturing of intimacy and familial relationships precipitated by the prison should be understood not as an incidental byproduct of a poorly designed carceral regime but as a tactic of war and a condition of genocide. Next, I theorize letter writing as an ethnographic and political modality that is part of a broader repertoire of strategies that Black men deploy to survive within and rebel against domestic war. I then draw on correspondence between myself and Absolute, an imprisoned Black man, as well as oral histories I collected with elders of New York's radical prison movement, to show how Black men care for each other, forge kinship networks, and transmit knowledge. I close by showing how Absolute carries on traditions of knowledge production and care to younger generations of captive Black men and by connecting this intergenerational practice to forms of collective rebellion.

RESUMEN
Este artículo examina las formas de parentesco intergeneracional y el trabajo de cuidar que hombres negros desempeñan dentro y más allá de las prisiones de Estados Unidos. Primero, ofrezco una conceptualización histórica de la guerra doméstica como un proceso de múltiples niveles que va dirigido al activismo radical negro, vida familiar/social y la interioridad de la subjetividad negra. Argumento que la ruptura de la intimidad y de las relaciones familiares precipitadas por la prisión debe ser entendida no como un subproducto incidental de un régimen carcelario mal diseñado sino como una táctica de guerra y una condición de genocidio. Seguidamente, teorizo el escribir cartas como una modalidad etnográfica y política que es parte de un repertorio más amplio de estrategias que los hombres negros utilizan para sobrevivir dentro, y rebelarse en contra de la guerra doméstica. Luego, me baso en la correspondencia entre Absoluto, un hombre negro encarcelado y el autor, así como historias orales recolectadas de los de más edad del movimiento radical de prisiones de Nueva York, para mostrar cómo los hombres negros cuidan el uno del otro, forjan redes de parentesco y transmiten conocimiento. Cierro mostrando cómo Absoluto continúa tradiciones de producción de conocimiento y cuidado por generaciones más jóvenes de hombres negros cautivos, y conectando esta práctica intergeneracional a formas de rebelión colectiva.

N2  - This article is an edited version of a conversation between Barbara Ransby and Derecka Purnell, two US-based key Black feminist activists on ‘New lines of Black resistance in the US: undoing racial capitalism and the carceral state’, which took place at the ‘New Circuits of Anti-racism Conference’, King’s College London, October 2022 (IRR50). They discuss their own political journeys, shared by many activists today, which they describe as involving building and re-envisioning a desired future, as well as the role of Black feminism and abolition. The conversation, introduced by Chantelle Lewis of Surviving Society and Sophia Siddiqui of Race & Class, unpacks the workings of the carceral state and the specific racial and class targeting of surplus Black workers. Drawing from their experience on the practicalities of organising today, they discuss their commitment to internationalism, the challenges of building genuine coalitions and the need to connect the dots between different systems of domination and violence to understand the functioning of the carceral state, and the centrality of reproductive justice and the fight for bodily autonomy.

N2  - Background
Individuals held in carceral settings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited research exists of the direct experiences of individuals detained by the United States (U.S.) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This study illustrates the major challenges described by individuals held in ICE’s immigration detention centers during the initial spread of COVID-19.
Methods
We interviewed 50 individuals who were released from ICE detention between March 15, 2020 until August 31, 2020. Participants were recruited through immigration attorneys. Responses to a semi-structured interview were documented. Quotes from these interviews were thematically analyzed.
Results
Study participants were detained in 22 different ICE detention centers, which were located across 12 states, in both county (41%) and privately-contracted facilities (59%). The major themes that emerged from interviews included inadequate protections against COVID-19, denial of physical and mental healthcare, and experiences of retaliation in response to self-advocacy. These issues perpetuated emotions of fear, distrust, and helplessness in individuals in immigration detention centers.
Conclusions
This study represents the largest analysis of experiences of ICE-detained immigrants during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure the rights to health and wellbeing for this population, further actions should include improving public health conditions, protecting against human rights violations, addressing barriers to healthcare access, ensuring transparency about conditions in detention centers, and moving toward decarceration.

N2  - This article draws on the stories of formerly incarcerated people to examine the ways in which the physical and social infrastructures of carceral facilities increase incarcerated people's vulnerability to environmental hazards exacerbated by climate change. We present qualitative data from interviews and focus groups with people who have been incarcerated in prisons and/or jails in Colorado regarding their experiences with incarceration infrastructure, amplifying the voices of formerly incarcerated people to identify vulnerabilities which have been deliberately hidden by carceral social and institutional processes, and adding them to the academic dialogue around incarceration and climate change. By providing testimony on the ways in which incarceration infrastructure—how they are designed, built, and maintained—amplify environmental harm, we identify how incarceration infrastructures create environmental vulnerability along axes of temperature, air quality, and water supply even before incarcerated people are exposed to climate hazards. Then, we illustrate ways incarcerated people encounter limits to their agency to mitigate this vulnerability, suggesting the need for structural change. Finally, we provide evidence that climate-related extreme temperatures, wildfires, and flood events experienced by our participants exploited the axes of vulnerability laid out above, affecting the majority (65%) of our 35 study participants. Overall, we argue current carceral infrastructure creates material realities that regularly cross the threshold of cruel and unusual punishment, and our argument supports decarceration as a necessary public policy intervention for robust, just, and humane climate resilience.

N2  - With the rollout of Covid vaccines, public debate regarding health in jails and prisons has increasingly shifted from decarceration toward vaccination of incarcerated people. But several factors suggest that vaccination alone won’t be enough to stop carceral outbreaks.

N2  - Context
In France, young children of incarcerated women live with their mothers in prison in specific units called nurseries, up to the age of 18 months. Only a few studies have examined the impact of this environment on these children. This study sought to explore through mothers' narratives how they perceive their children to experience this environment and how it affects their development.
Method
We used semistructured interviews to collect the perceptions of 25 mothers about their children's experience of daily life in 12 different prison nurseries in France. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to explore the data.
Results
According to mothers, prison is a sensorially aggressive environment for children that may impair the children's sensory abilities. The children's and mothers' emotional perceptions of anger, sadness, insecurity and imprisonment intertwine. Prison is home for these children, which leads them to establish strong bonds with this inside world—prison staff, other inmates—but to develop reluctances and concern about exploring the outside world.
Conclusion
The prison's sensorial environment may overlay the sensorial environment created by the mother, interfering with early mother–child interactions and leading to emotional misattunement. The gap between what the mother and the child each feel to be their home, and the social group they feel they belong to, causes pain to the mothers. This could alter their mandate of being a protective shield that could reduce the traumatic potential of the carceral environment on their babies. These mothers' sentences must be reconsidered for the sake of their children.

N2  - Background. Overdose deaths in the United States (U.S.) surpassed 100,000 in 2021. Problem-solving courts (PSCs), which originally began as drug courts, divert people with nonviolent felonies and underlying social issues (e.g. opioid use disorders (OUDs)) from the carceral system to a community-based treatment court program. PSCs are operated by a collaborative court staff team including a judge that supervises PSC clients, local court coordinators that manage PSC operations, among other staff. Based on staff recommendations, medications for opioid use disorders (MOUDs) can be integrated into court clients' treatment plans. MOUDs are an evidence-based treatment option. However, MOUDs remain widely underutilized within criminal justice settings partially due to negative perceptions of MOUDs held by staff. Objective. PSCs are an understudied justice setting where MOUD usage would be beneficial. This study sought to understand how court coordinators' perceptions and attitudes about MOUDs influenced their uptake and utilization in PSCs. Methods. A nationally representative survey of 849 local and 42 state PSC coordinators in the U.S. was conducted to understand how coordinators' perceptions influenced MOUD utilization. Results. Generally, court coordinators hold positive views of MOUDs, especially naltrexone. While state and local coordinators' views do not differ greatly, their stronger attitudes align with different aspects of and issues in PSCs such as medication diversion (i.e. misuse). Conclusions. This study has implications for PSCs and their staff, treatment providers, and other community supervision staff (e.g. probation/parole officers, court staff) who can promote and encourage the use of MOUDs by clients.

N2  - BackgroundDuring the period of community re-entry immediately following release from jail or prison, individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) face structural barriers to successful re-entry and high risk of overdose. Few published studies investigate experiences in the immediate period (i.e., first 24 h) of re-entry among people with OUD.AimTo understand the barriers and facilitators to treatment and reintegration of people with OUD during the initial transition from carceral settings back into the community.MethodsFrom January-December 2017, we conducted 42 semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients with a history of incarceration who were receiving methadone at a not-for-profit, low-barrier opioid treatment program. Interviews probed participants' community re-entry experiences immediately following incarceration. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using a Thematic Analysis approach.ResultsThe main themes described the experiences during the 24 h following release, reacclimating and navigating re-entry barriers, and re-entry preparedness and planning. Participants noted the initial 24 h to be a period of risk for returning to substance use or an opportunity to engage with OUD treatment as well as a tenuous period where many lacked basic resources such as shelter or money. When discussing the subsequent re-entry period, participants noted social challenges and persistent barriers to stable housing and employment. Participants overall described feeling unprepared for release and suggested improvements including formal transition programs, improved education, and support to combat the risk of overdose and return to substance use after incarceration.ConclusionsIn this study that qualitatively examines the experiences of people with incarceration histories and OUD enrolled in methadone treatment, we found that participants faced many barriers to community re-entry, particularly surrounding basic resources and treatment engagement. Participants reported feeling unprepared for release but made concrete suggestions for interventions that might improve the barriers they encountered. Future work should examine the incorporation of these perspectives of people with lived experience into the development of transition programs or re-entry classes.

N2  - In the wake of heightened concerns about gun violence and its impacts on youth, “what works” in gun violence prevention remains a critical public health concern. Gun violence prevention in the U.S. is increasingly interdisciplinary, involving both the criminal legal system and the health care system in developing an evidence base for promising programs and policies. The current study contributes to the literature by examining recidivism outcomes (i.e., rearrest) for a cohort of n = 409 Indianapolis youth involved in gun violence who were court-ordered to complete a health education-based prevention program called Project Life. The youth in our sample were predominantly from marginalized communities, all had been charged with a gun-involved or violence offense, 96% were detained by the juvenile justice system for some time, and 64% received at least one routine well check within five years prior to Project Life. Survival analyses of merged juvenile court records and health records show that routine health care (i.e., well visits) and completing the Project Life program were protective against recidivism, whereas time spent in detention increased risk. The findings provide evidence for the value of interdisciplinary approaches that include the health system in disrupting cycles of gun violence, while reducing the carceral footprint on youth.

N2  - The number of older adults incarcerated in prisons is growing significantly, and there is a great need for legal authority, processes, and resources to mitigate individual and social burdens of elder neglect and abuse within these settings. Older adults in prison may be particularly vulnerable to abuse, neglect, or exploitation. They are dependent on the carceral system for basic resources, are at risk for retaliatory actions for reporting mistreatment, and bear disproportionately high health burdens. This essay first considers standards and resources for mitigating elder mistreatment in the community and residential‐care settings in contrast to the available resources in prisons. Arguing that a conceptual model of elder abuse tailored to the prison population is needed, the essay proposes a research agenda through which such a model could be developed. The model could then be used in the creation of policy for detecting and mitigating elder mistreatment of incarcerated people. The essay concludes with a call to action to address the rift in legal protections and processes that leave older adults in prison at increased risk of abuse and neglect without a clear pathway for recourse.

N2  - Across the globe, museums filled with glass and plexiglass vitrines display collections of Indigenous belongings. The typical display scenario for such belongings places them upon plinths, underneath plexiglass. These cases render the life they contain into objects of display, things to be seen but not touched. For Indigenous people, experiencing this objectifying system of display is often traumatic because that which is on display fits neither category of object nor thing. They hold life, and are beings or ancestors; they are treated as kin. Alongside the life of ancestors who take material form, thousands of Indigenous songs collected by ethnographers on wax cylinder recordings and reel‐to‐reel tape are similarly confined in museum collections. These songs also hold life, but of different kinds from their material cousins. To reassess the role of the museum as a place that confines life is to put into question its relationship to incarceration. If the museum is a carceral space, how then, might we define repatriation alongside practices of “reentry” and kinship reconnection?
Resumen
A través del mundo, los museos se llenaron con vitrinas de vidrios y de plexiglás para mostrar colecciones de pertenencias de indígenas. El escenario de exhibición típico para tales pertenencias las coloca sobre pedestales bajo plexiglás. Estas vitrinas convierten la vida que contienen en objetos de exhibición, cosas para ser vistas pero no para ser tocadas. Para los indígenas que experimentan este sistema objetivador de exhibición es a menudo traumático porque lo que está en exposición no armoniza ni con la categoría de objeto ni de cosa. Ellas contienen vida y son seres o ancestros; ellas son tratadas como parientes. Junto a la vida de los ancestros quienes toman una forma material, miles de canciones indígenas compiladas por etnógrafos en registros de cilindros de cera y cintas de bovina abierta están confinadas similarmente en colecciones de museos. Estas canciones contienen también vida, pero de diferentes tipos de las de sus primos materiales. Reexaminar el papel del museo como un lugar que confina la vida es poner en cuestión su relación con encarcelamiento. Si el museo es un espacio carcelario ¿cómo entonces, podemos nosotros definir la repatriación junto a prácticas de “reentrada” y reconexión de parentesco?

N2  - BackgroundConducting research within a carceral health care context offers a unique view into the nature of drug use among arrestees with potential to identify and prevent drug use consequences. The purpose of this study was to characterize the nature and extent of drug use among first-time jail arrestees to inform detection and treatment.MethodsThis study utilized a naturalistic research design to collect de-identified urine drug screens (UDS), jail characteristics, and arrestee demographic variables among arrestees indicating drug use from 25 jails across the United States in 2023 through a confidential data sharing agreement with NaphCare, Inc. using its proprietary electronic health record operating system. Descriptive statistics were used to detail the features of the dataset, Pearson's chi-square tests of independence were performed to statistically analyze associations between UDS results and jail characteristics and arrestee demographics, and significant chi-square test results were further investigated by examining standardized residuals to clarify the nature and significance of within-group differences in proportions.ResultsOf the 43,553 UDS cases comprising the final sample (28.8% of total arrestees), 74.8% (32,561) were positive for one or more drugs, and 25.2% of UDS cases were negative for all drugs. Among those who tested positive, 69.0% were positive for cannabis, 54.8% for stimulants, 29.6% for opioids, and 12.4% for sedatives. Arrestees were positive for multiple drugs half the time, with combinations of cannabis, stimulants, and opioids most common. Significant associations between drug use and both jail characteristics and arrestee demographics were found.ConclusionsThough drug use is not a recent phenomenon, the lethality potential of the drugs being used today is relatively new. Arrestees with positive urine drug screens are at heightened risk of adverse outcome due to sudden cessation of substance use. Findings highlight the need for objective clinical data to guide acute treatment of individuals at risk of withdrawing while detained.

N2  - Trauma and Motherhood in Contemporary Literature and Culture repositions motherhood studies through the lens of trauma theory by exploring new challenges surrounding conception, pregnancy, and postpartum experiences. Chapters investigate nine case studies of motherhood trauma and recovery in literature and culture from the last twenty years by exploring their emotional consequences through the lens of trauma, resilience, and "working through" theories. Contributions engage with a transnational corpus drawn from the five continents and span topics as rarely discussed as pregnancy denial, surrogacy, voluntary or involuntary childlessness, racism and motherhood, carceral mothering practices, surrogacy, IVF, artificial wombs, and mothering through war, genocide, and migration. Accompanied by an online creative supplement, this volume deals with silenced aspects of embodied motherhood while enhancing a better understanding of the cathartic effects of storytelling.

N2  - Background: Over 600,000 people leave US prisons annually. Many are eligible for Medicaid upon release but may need support to enroll. Carceral facilities in nearly half of states have implemented systems to facilitate Medicaid access for those leaving incarceration, but there is limited information on program implementation models or outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate implementation and initial outcomes of Louisiana's prison-based Prerelease Medicaid Enrollment Program. Methods: In this mixed-methods study, we assessed enrollment in Louisiana Medicaid at time of release from prison in the 2 years (2017-2018) after Program implementation, as well as reasons for Medicaid closure (ie, loss of coverage) and health services use 6 months postrelease. In May-June 2019, we conducted interviews statewide with program implementers (n=16) and focus groups in New Orleans, Louisiana with formerly incarcerated Program participants (n=16). Results: A total of 4476 people were included in the quantitative analysis. There was a 34.3 (95% confidence interval: 20.7-47.9) percentage point increase in Medicaid enrollment upon release. Nearly all (98.6%) attended at least 1 outpatient visit and almost half (46.7%) had 1 emergency department visit within 6 months of release. Not responding to information requests was the most common reason for Medicaid closure. Program implementers and formerly incarcerated participants identified Program strengths, barriers, and suggestions for improvement. Conclusions: The program was successful in rapidly increasing Medicaid enrollment at the time of prison release and facilitating the use of health care services.

N2  - Background
Sexually transmitted infections are a significant, and growing, public health problem in this country – particularly among youth. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce the community burden of infection. Preliminary studies indicate that individuals involved in the criminal legal system have high rates of infection. While gaps exist in providing screening for incarcerated individuals, there are minimal efforts that have been initiated to screen individuals diverted from incarceration. In this study, we examined the STI risk profile and feasibility of screening for sexually transmitted infections for youth who were attending an alternative sentencing program after arrest for a minor offense. Youth were screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea using urine-based nucleic acid amplification tests.
Results
Of the 307 participants engaged in a program providing supportive services for criminal legal system involved youth at the Brooklyn Court House in New York City, 186 agreed to screening for sexually transmitted infections, and 8% were positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both.
Conclusions
Screening programs within carceral settings have proven effective in identifying individuals with STIs. However, with policy changes diverting more young people away from incarceration and into community-based programs, innovative programs are needed to identify STIs among youth in these settings. Our findings indicate that it is feasible to conduct venue-based screening in these settings, and, doing so may identify youth in need of treatment and further evaluation.

N2  - Recently, the Georgia state House of Representatives passed House Bill 1013, also called The Mental Health Parity Act. The bill sought to address access to and insurance coverage for mental health services, first identified in a report in 2020. The budget for mental health services was reduced by $8 m in 2020, despite an all-time high demand due to the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is an increasing inability to secure mental health care in the state. Georgia is ranked 37th in the country for access to quality mental health care (Reinert, Fritze, and Nguyen, 2022) and half the counties in the state have no psychiatrist; the projected mental health workforce will be able to meet only 12% of consumer demand by 2025. Problems with mental health care in Georgia have a long history which intersects with the history of racism, geographical segregation, and policing. HB1013 does not consider any of this history in its recommendations, which barely include nursing. At the same time, policy and practice in Georgia continues to entangle nurses and other professionals with a carceral and punitive system which not only threatens the safety of patients, but also nurses themselves. Nurses need to understand this history if they hope to develop policy that will intervene in the mental health care crisis.

N2  - Nurses working in correctional and forensic mental health settings face unique challenges in the provision of care to patients within custodial settings. The subjectivities of both patients and nurses are subject to the power relations, discourses and abjection encountered within these practice milieus. Using a poststructuralist approach using the work of Foucault, Kristeva, and Deleuze and Guattari, this paper explores how both patient and nurse subjectivities are produced within the carceral logic of this apparatus of capture. Recognizing that subjectivities are fluid and dynamic, and capable of change, Deleuze and Guattari's concept of deterritorialization will illustrate opportunities for resistance, where nurses can begin to practice outside the dominant carceral logic (and restrictions) of the system.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Extreme heat poses a distinct risk to the 2.1 million incarcerated people in the United States, who have disparately high rates of behavioral health conditions. Suicide is a leading cause of death among people in prisons.
OBJECTIVE To examine associations of extreme heat, solitary confinement, and an indicator of suicidal behaviors among incarcerated men in a Deep South US prison system.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal case series panel study included adult men in prisons in Louisiana, a state with one of the largest prison systems in the United States that has been engaged in litigation due to lack of air conditioning and extreme heat. The unit of analysis was prison facility-days. A facility-level data set was created by merging administrative data files, which included demographic characteristics, health classification, housing location and movement, disciplinary records, and involvement in suicide-watch incidents for all incarcerated men in Louisiana during the observation period. Individual-level variables were aggregated to facility-days to merge in daily maximum heat index data from the US Local Climatological Data, which were linked to the zip codes of prisons. The observation period was January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. Data set construction occurred from August 2020 to September 2022, and analysis was conducted from December 2022 to February 2023.
EXPOSURE The focal exposure was extreme heat days. Daily maximum heat index data were categorized into 6 bins (<30 degrees F, 30-39 degrees F, 40-49 degrees F, 50-59 degrees F, 70-79 degrees F, and >= 80 degrees F) and as an indicator for any facility-day where the maximum heat index exceeded the 90th percentile of heat indices for total days in observation period. Conditional fixed-effects negative binomial regression models were used to calculate incident rate ratios to test associations between extreme heat and suicide watch incidents, while controlling for covariates.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The focal outcome was daily count of suicide watch incidents that were recorded in a carceral system database. Covariates included daily percentages of incarcerated persons at each prison with serious mental illness diagnosis, daily rate of solitary confinement, and total facility population.
RESULTS The sample of 6 state-operated prisons provided 6576 facility-days for the analysis. Results suggest a dose-responsive association between extreme heat and daily counts of suicide-watch incidents; compared with days with temperatures between 60 and 69 degrees F, the rate of daily suicide incidents increased by 29% when the heat index reached the level of caution (ie, 80-89 degrees F) and by 36% when reaching extreme caution (90-103 degrees F) (80-89 degrees F: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43; P<.001; 90-103 degrees F: IRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.15-1.61; P<.001). Compared with other days, those with the extreme heat indicator were significantly associated with a 30% increase in the incident rate of daily suicide-watch incidents (IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18-1.45; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings suggest an association between extreme heat and an indicator of suicidality among an incarcerated sample, contribute to an emerging literature exploring linkages between climatological events and health outcomes in prisons, and may have implications for legal interventions and advocacy seeking to abate heat-induced morbidity and mortality in carceral contexts.

N2  - In this experimental year‐in‐review article, we center the everyday, ongoing, and emergent rebellions of livingness against imbricated structures of antiblackness and Indigenous erasure that shape carceral global landscapes to think with the premise that “liberation is an already existing and unfinished and unmet possibility” (McKittrick 2021, 13). We do so through engaging what Orisanmi Burton (2021, 2) theorizes as the “ethnographic and political modality” of letter writing as an intimate practice of radical kinship and rebellious method. Our focus is on rebellious methods of living and loving that call on anthropologists to think with the fugitive acts of everyday people struggling to survive the shifting terrains of white supremacy, settler‐colonial and capitalist power, and ecological devastation while also tending to the forms of expansion, imagination, and rearticulation that always already exist in and beyond this frame. Sharing practices of rebellion and rebellious method across geographies allows us to hone anthropological insights from terrains of struggle through which alternative futures can be imagined, including constellations of a new humanism and anticipatory vocabularies of otherwise worlds.
Resumen
En este artículo experimental del año en revisión, centramos las rebeliones cotidianas, continuas y emergentes del vivir en contra de estructuras imbricadas de antinegridad y el borrado indígena que estructura los paisajes globales carcelarios para pensar con la premisa que “la liberación es una posibilidad ya existente e inacabada e insatisfecha” (McKittrick 2021, 13). Lo hacemos a través de comprometernos con lo theorizado por Orisanmi Burton (2021, 2) como la “modalidad etnográfica y política” de escribir cartas como una práctica íntima de parentesco radical y método rebelde. Nuestro enfoque es en métodos rebeldes del vivir y amar que apela a los antropólogos a pensar con los actos fugitivos de las personas comunes luchando para sobrevivir los terrenos cambiantes de la supremacía blanca, el poder colonial de poblamiento y capitalista, y la devastación ecológica mientras tendiendo también a las formas de expansión, imaginación y rearticulación que siempre ya existen en y más allá de este marco. Compartir prácticas de rebelión y método rebelde a lo largo de las geografías nos permite pulir entendimientos de terrenos de lucha a través de los cuales futuros alternativos pueden ser imaginados, incluyendo constelaciones de un nuevo humanismo y vocabularios anticipatorios de otros mundos.

N2  - Examining infanticide cases in the United States from the late
eighteenth to the late nineteenth centuries, Proving
Pregnancy documents how women-Black and white, enslaved and
free-gradually lost control over reproduction to male medical and
legal professionals. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
community-based female knowledge played a crucial role in
prosecutions for infanticide: midwives, neighbors, healers, and
relatives were better acquainted with an accused woman's intimate
life, the circumstances of her pregnancy, and possible motives for
infanticide than any man. As the century progressed, women accused
of the crime were increasingly subject to the scrutiny of white
male legal and medical experts educated in institutions that
reinforced prevailing ideas about the inferior mental and physical
capacities of women and Black people. As Reconstruction ended, the
reach of the carceral state expanded, while law and medicine
simultaneously privileged federal and state regulatory power over
that of local institutions. These transformations placed all
women's bodies at the mercy of male doctors, judges, and juries in
ways they had not been before. Reframing knowledge of the body as
property, Felicity M. Turner shows how, at the very moment when the
federal government expanded formal civil and political rights to
formerly enslaved people, the medical profession instituted new
legal regulations across the nation that restricted access to
knowledge of the female body to white men.

N2  - Introduction
Individuals who are incarcerated in the United States often struggle to access family planning care because of the common practice of jails not providing contraceptives on site. However, less is known about the contraceptive needs and preferences, including the desirability of intrauterine devices and implants, among those who are incarcerated.
Methods
Cross‐sectional, in‐person surveys were administered to 148 reproductive‐age women (aged 18‐48) incarcerated at an urban jail in Utah to identify women's contraceptive needs and preferences while incarcerated. We used summary statistics and logistic regression to investigate relationships between demographic characteristics, the desire to access contraceptive services while incarcerated, and interest in specific contraceptive methods.
Results
Surveys indicate a high interest in accessing contraceptives while in jail (73%). Participants who were more likely to prefer access to contraceptive services in jail were also more likely to be interested in the injectable (odds ratio [OR], 4.75; 95% CI, 1.03‐21.94), the implant (OR, 8.44; 95% CI, 1.70‐41.99), and intrauterine devices (OR, 10.04; 95% CI, 3.46‐29.20) than participants indicating no desire to access contraceptive services while in jail.
Discussion
Jails could be an access point for contraceptive methods requiring health care provider intervention in the state of Utah. However, care must be taken due to broader historical legacies of reproductive coercion in carceral settings.

N2  - In this article, I analyze the emergence of New York City’s infrastructure of homeless shelters dialectically, relationally, and historically. The members of Boogie Down Productions met in an incipient New York City homeless shelter in the mid-1980s. Their relationship and music is a window into a critical political consciousness of men living in homeless shelters because the artists gave expression to an emergent structure of feeling of resistance taking hold during intense changes to New York’s political economy and its institutions. The paper first analyzes homeless policy and infrastructural change through a reading of archival sources and government reports and documents. The second section understands oral histories conducted with men living in a New York City homeless shelter as blues geographies—insurgent, critical explanations of these institutional spaces. Shelter residents actively challenge the material conditions, relations, and values that produce homeless shelters as essential instruments of the carceral state. I argue that they activate this resistance to the naturalization of shelters, and themselves as homeless, by narrating carceral spaces as abolitionist spaces.

N2  - Empire of the Beat is an investigation of the nature of everyday policing along with the development of carceral-scapes in colonial Punjab and their resonances & connections across colonies of the British Empire, from the nineteenth to the twentieth century. The work reframes policing as governance on the ground or at the level of the beat, the territory a police officer patrolled, rather than a simple tool of colonial repression. In fact, policing was not simply torture and exceptional violence – in the everyday context, policing was also defined by its (il)legal nature or the productive frictions between the colonial state’s writ, and the exigencies of social, racial, class, and caste politics within the police’s jurisdiction. In doing so, it sheds light on the daily making and re-making of the bodies of the colonized and the colonizers through encounters of the patrol and technologies of surveillance and discipline. The work also attends to the creation of novel carceral-scapes in Punjab across three temporal scenes: the kots or reformatory villages of the 1850s, the canal colonies of the 1880s, and the habitual offender of the 1910s. Together these carceral scapes of Punjab reflect a colonial imperative of population management that defined governance in the late 19th century. In this sense, Punjab became the site for legislating people in colonial India during this period and pioneered the production and regulation of criminal objects and productive subjects through these carceral-scapes. These three temporal scenes also reflect the increasingly intrusive gaze of the colonial state which expanded beyond dealing with nebulous groups of criminal objects in 1850s and structured populations of productive subjects in the 1880s to a more narrowed down scrutiny of the individual colonized body by the 20th century. Overall, this research demonstrates the historical significance of policing as a mode of everyday governance going beyond exceptional moments of violence, which will cast new light on the police’s role in ordering the colonial state and producing the postcolonial world.

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disproportionately affects certain sub-populations, including people with experience of incarceration (PWEI). Little is known about how perceptions of HCV and treatment have changed despite simplifications in testing and treatment in carceral settings. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with people living with or having a history of HCV infection released from Quebec provincial prison. Interviews were guided by the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM) and aimed to explore cognitive and emotional representations of HCV and coping strategies. Among the 19 participants, seven (37%) were diagnosed with HCV in prison and 14 (74%) had previously received HCV treatment. Participants’ HCV illness perceptions were influenced by fear (of HCV transmission, death, and the well-being of family) and stigma (related to HCV, injection drug use, and incarceration). While some sought education and social and professional support, others self-isolated or engaged in high-risk behaviors to cope. Despite advances in HCV treatment, PWEI continue to experience various forms of stigma and fear surrounding their HCV diagnosis, resulting in delayed HCV care. These findings provide insights into how prison-based healthcare providers can better utilize HCV illness perceptions to evaluate willingness to engage in HCV care among PWEI.

N2  - Geographical inequalities in life and death are among the world's most pronounced in the United States. However, the driving forces behind this macroscopic variation in population health outcomes remain surprisingly understudied, both empirically and theoretically. The present article steps into this breach by assessing a number of theoretically informed hypotheses surrounding the underlying causes of such spatial heterogeneity. Above and beyond a range of usual suspects, such as poverty, unemployment, and ethno-racial disparities, we find that a hitherto neglected explanans is prison incarceration. In particular, through the use of previously unavailable county-level panel data and a compound instrumentation technique suited to isolating exogenous treatment variation, high imprisonment rates are shown to substantially increase the population-wide risk of premature death. Our findings contribute to the political economy of population health by relating the rise of the carceral state to the amplification of geographically anchored unequal life chances.

N2  - This book offers a broad international analysis of healthcare corruption, drawing upon criminology, sociology, psychology, law, political and behavioural economics  and nudge theory. It engages with the existing key debates on how to define healthcare corruption and the measurement of it but builds on this and offers new analysis of these issues in the private healthcare sector too. Furthermore, it moves beyond the analysis of funds lost to healthcare and includes the impact and costs of healthcare corruption on victims and family members of victims and the CJS. It also uniquely considers that the healthcare sector victimizes patients and its own employees, with the healthcare sector as part of a carceral state to help highlight how different disciplines can contribute to our understanding in reducing healthcare corruption.

N2  - In this paper, we examine immigration detention in Portugal, a system whose daily operations and inherent violence are overlooked in both public and academic discourses. Even within community psychology, discussions on immigration detention have largely remained on the fringes of scholarly debates. Guided by a justice-centered ecological lens, we map the contours of daily life in detention by centering the intersectional struggles of detained cisgender and transgender women. These struggles illuminate the politics of power and resistance at play in these sites, contributing to interrelated ecologies of knowledge and advancing a critical understanding of the systems of power and oppression articulated around borders, citizenship, and the "making of migration." Our findings reveal Portuguese detention centers as uncaring environments where women feel constantly threatened, unsafe and disregarded, with their well-being severely compromised. Ignorance reigns in these sites, wielded as a form of power. Yet, despite this, detained women create counterspaces and cultivate ecologies of knowledge and resistance from the ground up. We conclude by reflecting on how community-engaged scholars and activists can contribute to transformative and liberatory efforts against carceral border systems, working toward futures of freedom, dignity, and justice for all.

N2  - SummaryBackgroundRates of suicide and self-harm are elevated in carceral institutions. Inmates are a vulnerable group since they are exposed to multiple risk factors. This paper critically reviews empirical research on programs to prevent suicidal and self-harmful behaviors in correctional facilities and summarizes effect sizes across studies. MethodsWe searched PsychINFO, PubMed, IEEEXPLORE and the CRISE Documentation Centre Database to identify relevant articles published before June 2022. Inclusion criteria were: peer-reviewed and with outcome data on effectiveness of prevention activities. Two reviewers independently assessed 905 articles to determine inclusion eligibility. Quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Meta-analyses using random-effect models were used to pool effect sizes for each outcome. This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. FindingsTwenty-four of the 905 articles, published between 1980 and 2022, were included. Studies were frequently conducted in the United States ( n=13; 54%) and used varying study designs; most frequently pre-post with no control group ( n=9; 38%). Sample sizes and interventions varied considerably. Most were of moderate quality ( n=21; 88%). On average, prevention programs in correctional facilities were effective in decreasing suicide deaths (pooled rate ratio of 0·35 [95% CI 0·23 to 0·55; p<0·001]; I 2=68·01%), incidents of self-harm (pooled Hedges'g of -0·54 (95% CI: -1·03 to -0·05; p=0·031]; I 2=81·34%), and suicidal ideation (pooled Hedges'g of -0·39 [95% CI: -0·65 to -0·14; p=0·003]; I 2=47·09%). InterpretationPrevention activities are effective in reducing suicide death, self-harm and suicidal ideation in correctional settings. Multicomponent programs, which include several preventive activities, seem to be most effective in reducing suicide deaths. Future evaluation studies should control for confounding variables by including control groups, having larger samples and limiting attrition. Standards for suicide prevention in jails and prisons should be included in National suicide prevention strategies. FundingNone.

N2  - Philadelphia has one of the country's largest populations re‐entering society after incarceration. Reentry services have been critiqued for their ineffectiveness. Scholars note the lack of evidence‐based practices (EBPs) in the field, and the challenges of translating them. Through a case study of one reentry agency implementing an EBP, we examine engagement with the intervention by clients and service providers. Qualitative interviews were conducted with clients and staff (n = 35). A grounded theory using sensitizing concepts approach was used to analyze the data. Productive engagement with the intervention was facilitated by: (1) translatability of the core EBP elements so that they addressed client and staff needs, (2) accessibility to the intervention by enhancing subjective ownership and successfully navigating logistical barriers, and (3) collectivity among participants and staff that helped them address societal and structural barriers. Productive engagement with an EBP can resist carceral processes in reentry service‐provision.

N2  - Background
Massachusetts passed legislation in 2018 to mandate provision of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in select jails to address the high risk of opioid overdose after release. Since 2019, we have conducted a Type-1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of this program. We present findings on the perspectives and experiences of persons treated in these jails.

We conducted qualitative analyses of semi-structured interviews that were conducted in 2022 with 38 adults released to the community who had been treated with MOUD while living in one of eight Massachusetts jails. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) framework informed development of the interview guide and analysis of qualitative data. Deductive and inductive strategies were used for coding and analyses.
Results
Participants were 41.5 years old; predominantly male; 84.2% white, 23.7% Hispanic/Latino and 7.9% Black; and most continued taking MOUD. Thematic analysis focused on four code reports: Perception of Addiction/MOUD, Barriers/Facilitators, Impact of MOUD in Jails, and Stigma. Participants perceived that MOUD helped to prevent relapse. Prompt and consistent access to medication, and respectful treatment by healthcare and carceral staff were highlighted as facilitators. In contrast, some participants perceived that policy-centered rather than patient-centered treatment drove timing of medication initiation or response to medication changes. Insufficient staffing and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to treatment delays. Overall, individuals incarcerated in jails that have expanded treatment eligibility to include earlier induction with MOUD generally felt more positive about their experience than individuals reporting delayed induction.
Conclusions
Participants valued the ability of jail based MOUD programs to help clients achieve recovery from OUD. Their perceptions highlight the intrinsic value of MOUD programs that promote and support wellbeing through a person-centered approach to treatment. Participants stressed that MOUD programs should be patient-centered and guided by patients’ symptoms and needs.

N2  - Transgender women (i.e., persons who were assigned male sex at birth but who live and identify as female) experience forms of discrimination that limit their access to stable housing and contribute to high rates of incarceration; once incarcerated, the approaches used to assign them housing within the jail or prison place them at risk for abuse, rape, and other outcomes. Yet, a paucity of studies explores the implications of carceral housing assignments for transgender women.
Whether the approaches used to assign housing in jails and prisons violate the rights of incarcerated transgender persons has been argued before the US federal courts under Section 1983 of the US Constitution, which allows persons who were raped while incarcerated to claim a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights.
Reforms and policy recommendations have been attempted; however, the results have been mixed and the public health implications have received limited attention.

N2  - SummaryThe 1990 resolution by the UN General Assembly committed member states to provide health-care equity for people in prison, who are included in the global goals to control HIV and eliminate hepatitis C virus (HCV) by 2030. WHO has set ambitious HCV elimination targets by including people who inject drugs (PWID), yet has not prioritised PWID who are incarcerated, a substantial population who have or are at risk for HCV infection. Human rights principles of health-care equity stipulate that “prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community, without discrimination on the grounds of their legal status”. Globally, only nine countries provide prison-based needle and syringe programmes (PNSPs), essential evidence-based interventions to holistically reduce the harms from drug use, of which only three countries extend reach to all prisons. Even where available, these services are accessed by few participants. PNSPs are recommended as an essential element of an effective HIV and HCV prevention strategy in prisons, and studies have shown that they are key to achieving HCV elimination in carceral settings. This Viewpoint, based primarily on unpublished data from key country-level stakeholders and expert opinion, highlights our perspective that implementation factors related to PNSP delivery in diverse settings likely contribute to low adoption and use of these services by PWID in prisons compared with in the community. However, successful expansion of these evidence-based interventions will depend on political commitment, national surveillance and monitoring programmes, and state-of-the-art implementation science methods, where inputs from multilevel stakeholders should guide improved implementation. Policy makers are urged to create and support opportunities to scale up PNSPs within countries where they exist and expand them to other countries where they are needed to solidify years of commitment towards the 2030 HCV elimination goals.

N2  - BackgroundPeople with substance use disorders are highly prevalent in the carceral system. Recovery capital (RC) is the resources available to an individual to initiate or maintain substance use cessation. Sex differences have been identified in RC during both active substance use and recovery in the general population, however, less is known about these sex differences in the post-incarceration population.MethodsParticipants (n = 136) were those with an opioid or stimulant use disorder with past year involvement with the Iowa criminal justice system (USA), who completed the Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) twice over a six-month cohort study. Participants were involved in an addiction clinic that utilized active case management. Analysis of covariance evaluated changes in ARC during the study. Separate models compared total ARC and individual ARC domains, with sex as the independent variable of interest. Model means were generated for interpretation based on sex, comparing baseline and study endpoint ARC scores.ResultsThere were no baseline sex differences in total ARC. ARC increased significantly for the group, however, males showed disproportionate growth. Females ended the study with a mean ARC of 37.8 (SD= 9.3) and males finished at 41.6 (SD= 9.3), which was a significant difference (p = 0.044); this significant difference was driven by ARC subdomains of 'Psychological Health' and 'Physical Health.'ConclusionsPeople post-incarceration are at high risk for return to substance use. Treatment that is informed by sex-based differences may have the potential to decrease the differing rates of growth in RC between sexes.

N2  - Background
Firearm injuries are the second leading cause of death among youth in the United States. Nonfatal firearm injuries far outnumber fatalities, yet data detailing the recovery and post-injury needs of pediatric patients after hospital discharge are limited. This study evaluated health system support of pediatric patients after firearm injury, from acute hospitalization to outpatient follow-up.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients <18 years who presented to an urban level 1 trauma center between 2014 and 2019. Cases were categorized as accidental or intentional (stratified as assault-related or “crossfire” injuries). Outcomes included biopsychosocial assessment (BA) utilization, trauma psychology service consultation, and linkage to outpatient services.
Results
Among 115 patients, 94% were victims of community violence. Black (50%) and Latinx (44%) patients were disproportionately affected, as were males aged 15-16 years (71%). Overall mortality was 8%. Biopsychosocial assessment and trauma psychology consultations occurred in 43% and 20% of cases, respectively. Of eligible patients, 71% received referral to post-hospitalization support services. The most commonly identified needs were counseling, gang intervention, and help with the carceral system.
Conclusion
Health systems should support long-term recovery of pediatric patients after firearm injury, particularly addressing social and structural determinants of health. Inpatient-to-outpatient linkages should be strengthened, and prospective follow-up is needed.

N2  - BackgroundYoung Black men are disproportionately and adversely affected by incarceration and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), both of which share common social and structural determinants. It is well documented that incarcerated individuals, including youth, are more likely to acquire STIs in the carceral setting compared to the general population. However, the effects of imprisonment on sexual health outcomes after imprisonment are not well-understood. The relationship between incarceration history (having ever spent time in a correctional institution such as prison, jail, or juvenile detention) and chlamydia positivity was examined in this study. MethodsA secondary analysis of the Check it Program, a Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) community-based seek, test, and treat screening program for Black men aged 15-24 who have sex with women in New Orleans was conducted. Participants completed a computer-assisted self-administered questionnaire on relevant sexual and social histories and provided a urine specimen for a Ct urine nucleic acid amplification test. Bivariate and multivariable regressions were used to estimate the association between incarceration history and chlamydia positivity. ResultsParticipants (N = 1,907) were enrolled from May 2017 to March 2020. Of those, 351/1,816 (19.3%) reported past incarceration and 203/1,888 (10.8%) tested positive for Ct. When adjusted for age, insurance status, and condom use, having a history of incarceration was positively associated with a positive Ct test (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval):1.61 (1.12, 2.31), p = 0.0095). ConclusionsInteracting with the carceral system is associated with a positive Ct test post-incarceration. Incarceration may be an important marker for Ct acquisition in young Black men who have sex with women and those with a history of incarceration should be prioritized for Ct screening after release.

N2  - The Politics of Prison Crowding investigates recent transformations in Italy's penal system to make the key analytical observation that conditions of overcrowding have become the 'new normal' under which the modern prison system continues to operate and deliver punishment. Engaging with the politics of crowding thus entails a direct and pertinent engagement with the modern state's politics of criminal justice and social control.
Worldwide, over the last decades, a growing number of jurisdictions have prison systems operating above or to the limit of their capacity; yet, little attention has been paid to these elements in the analysis of prison politics and day-to-day functions. By exploring the crowding issue, this book offers an original and interesting insight into the politics and dynamics characterising contemporary prison systems. The hypothesis of this book is that the politics of prison crowding have become the template for the daily administration of the prison system, which incorporates not just policy and rules but day-to-day functions and practices regulating life behind bars. Through interviews in modern Italian prisons, the book brings to light a radical redefinition of a carceral system that harshens the delivery of punishment while justifying this exacerbation of pain by adding new bureaucratic logic to the administration of the penal system within a narrative of compliance to human rights standards.
By shedding new light on prison politics to open new critical perspectives and research paths, The Politics of Prison Crowding offers a fundamental tool to scholars, students, and all professional policymakers and practitioners dealing with prison policies and the politics of justice.

N2  - Prison has been described as the ultimate form of time-punishment – a place where time is no longer a commodity for individuals to spend, but is ordered by a system which symbolises its power through the control of segments of people’s lives. As such, a prison sentence epitomises the experience of waiting. Yet anticipating release is not the only form of waiting within carceral life; waiting for healthcare in its various forms also shapes people’s temporal experience. Drawing on interviews with 21 people who have lived in prison, this article describes how experiences of waiting for healthcare are mediated by expectation or hope, perceptions of the relationship between behaviour and healthcare access, and the consequences of waiting for care. Constraints on the autonomy of people in prison mean that waiting for healthcare differs in important ways from waiting for healthcare in the community, and can be perceived as an additional form of punishment. The experience of waiting for prison healthcare can affect physical and psychological well-being, and can in itself be understood as a pain of imprisonment.

N2  - In this article, we explore critical university studies (CUS), an interdisciplinary body of scholarship that interrogates structures of higher education and their entanglements with national and global institutions and political movements. Favoring an expansive definition of CUS, we draw from scholars who trace the origins of the American university to the slave trade, racial science, and Native American ethnic cleansing projects, as well as scholars who bring abolitionist and decolonial stances to highlight how the university continues to perpetuate state interests, carceral and settler logics, empire, and antiblackness. We then bring the lens of CUS to bear on critical work by anthropologists on higher education and on the discipline more broadly. We explore the challenges of advocating for antiracist and anti-imperial anthropology without attending to the structures of Western white superiority that have enabled its institutionalization. We conclude by considering interventions by the emerging field of abolitionist anthropology.

N2  - U.S. prisons were especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection and death; however, data limitations have precluded a national accounting of prison mortality (including but not limited to COVID-19 mortality) during the pandemic. Our analysis of mortality data collected from public records requests (supplemented with publicly available data) from 48 Departments of Corrections provides the most comprehensive understanding to date of in-custody mortality during 2020. We find that total mortality increased by 77% in 2020 relative to 2019, corresponding to 3.4 times the mortality increase in the general population, and that mortality in prisons increased across all age groups (49 and under, 50 to 64, and 65 and older). COVID-19 was the primary driver for increases in mortality due to natural causes; some states also experienced substantial increases due to unnatural causes. These findings provide critical information about the pandemic’s toll on some of the country’s most vulnerable individuals while underscoring the need for data transparency and standardized reporting in carceral settings.
U.S. prison mortality increased 77%, 3.4 times the general population mortality increase, in 2020, the year of COVID-19 onset.

N2  - Background Establishing and maintaining relationships and ways of connecting and being with others is an important component of health and wellbeing. Harnessing the relational within caring, supportive, educational, or carceral settings as a systems response has been referred to as relational practice. Practitioners, people with lived experience, academics and policy makers, do not yet share a well-defined common understanding of relational practice. Consequently, there is potential for interdisciplinary and interagency miscommunication, as well as the risk of policy and practice being increasingly disconnected. Comprehensive reviews are needed to support the development of a coherent shared understanding of relational practice.Method This study uses a scoping review design providing a scope and synthesis of extant literature relating to relational practice focussing on organisational and systemic practice. The review aimed to map how relational practice is used, defined and understood across health, criminal justice, education and social work, noting any impacts and benefits reported. Searches were conducted on 8 bibliographic databases on 27 October 2021. English language articles were included that involve/discuss practice and/or intervention/s that prioritise interpersonal relationships in service provision, in both external (organisational contexts) and internal (how this is received by workers and service users) aspects.Results A total of 8010 relevant articles were identified, of which 158 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the synthesis. Most were opinion-based or theoretical argument papers (n = 61, 38.60%), with 6 (3.80%) critical or narrative reviews. A further 27 (17.09%) were categorised as case studies, focussing on explaining relational practice being used in an organisation or a specific intervention and its components, rather than conducting an evaluation or examination of the effectiveness of the service, with only 11 including any empirical data. Of the included empirical studies, 45 were qualitative, 6 were quantitative, and 9 mixed methods studies. There were differences in the use of terminology and definitions of relational practice within and across sectors.Conclusion Although there may be implicit knowledge of what relational practice is the research field lacks coherent and comprehensive models. Despite definitional ambiguities, a number of benefits are attributed to relational practices.

N2  - Introduction:
This article politicizes a reimbursement model proposed by some professional nursing associations that aim to better align the price of nursing labor (nurses’ pay) to the value of nursing and make nurses’ contributions more visible.
Methods:
Using the concept of “missing care,” the critique reveals how professionalization directs attention to individual-level interactions between care seekers and practitioners while obscuring from view the harm inflicted by social institutions and structures constitutive of a capitalist political economy and the related carceral state.
Results:
Direct reimbursement models render practitioners complicit in the harms perpetrated and perpetuated by the health care industrial complex while professionalization processes are deployed to reduce cognitive dissonance (and moral injury) produced by combining harm with nursing’s normative principles.
Discussion:
We describe and trace the complementary capitalist imperatives of extraction-based profit maximization and efficiency through the health care industrial complex to demonstrate how formative those imperatives are of the health care system, care-seekers’ outcomes, nurses’ experiences, nonconsensual modes of data collection, and surveillance.
Conclusion:
The naturalization of racial capitalism and the precarity and violence it entails foreclose the creation of ethical alternatives that prioritize well-being instead of the pursuit of profit that could bring the provision of and payment for care closer to the normative principles held by practitioners.

N2  - During the COVIDicine, many nurses awoke to the ways that the Healthcare‐Industrial Complex (HIC) dictates the care we are able to provide. Using the Foucauldian concepts of pastoral power and governmentality, we explore the ways that nurses participate in upholding power structures within the HIC and reproducing them in our work, contributing to a carceral culture based on hierarchy and power dynamics. We also explore the ways nurses are both agentic in this system and subject to it, reluctant to make waves and lose our place within a system that can offer nurses safety and security in, and most importantly, a paycheck. This paper articulates a prefigurative anarchist approach to nursing praxis. Through the writing of Emma Goldman, we locate a historically founded philosophical basis for practical tactics that nurses can use to actualise this praxis. Both individually and as a collective, nurses can assert their own ethic and power through direct action, micro‐insurgency and solidarity to build the world we know can be. Our only limitation is our imagination.

N2  - Background:
Adults aged 55 or above represent a large and growing proportion of the US and international correctional populations and more physical and mental health problems than their non-incarcerated peers. Social capital represents the collective cognitive and network structure resources accessible through social relationships and may serve as a potential asset in carceral settings in the amelioration of depressive symptoms among older adults.
Method:
A sample of men drawn from a study of older adults in Kentucky prisons (n = 91) was used to meet the following aims: (1) explore relationships among cognitive and structural facets of social capital, chronic health conditions and depressive symptoms and (2) identify the role of social capital (viz. trust) alongside chronic health conditions as a determinant of depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that each indicator of social capital would relate negatively to depressive symptoms and that trust would emerge as most strongly associated with depressive symptoms.
Results:
Bivariate correlations between depression and social capital variables related as we hypothesized. However, our hypotheses were only partially supported. Higher trust was correlated to fewer depressive symptoms (r = .21, p < .05) revealing a lighter side of trust in the correctional milieu but was unrelated to depression when controlling for variables. An interaction term in the final model indicated a different role for trust. Factors accounted for 64% of variance in depressive symptoms among older adults in a state prison (F(10, 80) = 14.25, p < .001). In this model, higher trust was related to depressive symptoms when included alongside additional measures of social capital, indicating that a darker side of this facet may exist within correctional settings.
Conclusion:
Many indicators of social capital (e.g., network size) demonstrated potentially protective benefits against depression, while trust revealed a more complex role related to chronic health conditions. Limited measures and the agnostic behavior of trust require attention by future researchers.

N2  - The opioid epidemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Health systems, policymakers, payers, and public health have enacted numerous strategies to reduce the harms of opioids, including opioid use disorder (OUD). Much of this implementation has occurred before the development of OUD‒related comparative effectiveness evidence, which would enable an understanding of the benefits and harms of different approaches. This article from the American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) uses a prevention framework to identify the current approaches and make recommendations for addressing the opioid epidemic, encompassing strategies across a primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention approach.
Key primordial prevention strategies include addressing social determinants of health and reducing adverse childhood events. Key primary prevention strategies include supporting the implementation of evidence-based prescribing guidelines, expanding school-based prevention programs, and improving access to behavioral health supports. Key secondary prevention strategies include expanding access to evidence-based medications for opioid use disorder, especially for high-risk populations, including pregnant women, hospitalized patients, and people transitioning out of carceral settings. Key tertiary prevention strategies include the expansion of harm reduction services, including expanding naloxone availability and syringe exchange programs.
The ACPM Opioid Workgroup also identifies opportunities for de-implementation, in which historical and current practices may be ineffective or causing harm. De-implementation strategies include reducing inappropriate opioid prescribing; avoiding mandatory one-size-fits-all policies; eliminating barriers to medications for OUD, debunking the myth of detoxification as a primary solo treatment for opioid use disorder; and destigmatizing care practices and policies to better treat people with OUD.

N2  - The prison-industrial complex has historically operated as a mechanism for social control generally and as a tool to restrict women’s reproductive capacities specifically. Reproductive justice is a domain within the practice of health law. However, health law as currently practiced is ill-equipped to understand how the carceral state functions as a structural determinant of health or how legacies of oppression have facilitated the abridgment of incarcerated women’s reproductive capacities.

N2  - While criminal legal involvement is a structural determinant of health, both administrative and national longitudinal cohort data are collected and made available in a way that prevents a full understanding of this relationship. Administrative data are both collected and overseen by the same entity and are incomplete, delayed, and/or uninterpretable. Cohort data often only ask these questions to the most vulnerable, and do not include all types of criminal legal involvement, when this involvement occurs in someone’s life, or family and community involvement. To achieve a more optimized data landscape and to facilitate population-level research on criminal legal involvement and health, (1) individual administrative level data must be made available and able to be linked across carceral systems, (2) a national data archive must be made to maintain and make criminal legal data available to researchers, and (3) a nationally representative, longitudinal study focused on those with criminal legal involvement is necessary. By beginning to critically think about how future data could be collated and collected, we can begin to provide more robust evidence around how the criminal legal system impacts the health of our society and, in turn, create policy reform.

N2  - Background:
Incarcerated perinatal populations report high rates of substance use in the United States (US). Despite this, substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is not routinely available in carceral settings and state policies related to the provision of substance use screening and treatment are unknown.
Methods:
We conducted a systematic search in WestLaw through the end of the 2020 legislative session combining the terms “pregnant” and “postpartum” with terms for incarceration and related terms. The search returned 453 statutes from 43 states. A deductive codebook of various maternal health topics was developed. Legislative texts related to SUD screening and treatment were extracted for textual analysis.
Results:
Of the 43 states identified as having at least 1 state statute pertaining to pregnant or postpartum incarcerated people, 7 states had statutes relevant to SUD screening and treatment. Statutes related to substance use screening, education, treatment and diversion programs, program eligibility, aftercare and release planning, and funding appropriations.
Conclusions:
The majority of states across the U.S. lack legislation that address SUD screening and treatment among incarcerated perinatal populations. Given the known limited access to SUD treatment for perinatal populations in custody, increasing legislative statutes could increase access to essential care.

N2  - Movements for racial and Indigenous justice are targeting rapidly expanding budget allocations for prisons and police. In Australia, Indigenous Communities are seeking to redirect public money from the criminal justice system to Indigenous-controlled services and infrastructure through ‘justice reinvestment’. This article explores the possibilities and tensions of justice reinvestment as a strategy for exercising Indigenous self-determination in a marketised policy landscape. Focusing on the case of Just Reinvest NSW and the Maranguka initiative in Bourke, we compare justice reinvestment to neoliberal ideas of social investment, exemplified by social impact bonds (SIBs). We identify three tools of marketisation in SIBs – liability budgeting, pricing evidence, and devolution to non-state providers – and analyse how these are being engaged, and contested, by Indigenous Communities through justice reinvestment. While incomplete, we discuss how Indigenous-run justice reinvestment initiatives are creatively using these tools against the settler-colonial, carceral state to claim fiscal resources, develop bureaucratic capacity, and institute territorial governance. We argue that justice reinvestment demonstrates the potential to repurpose the tools of marketisation to create alternative ‘hybrid’ spaces of governance that contest both the state and the market.

N2  - Background
Correctional settings are hotspots for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Social and biological risk factors contribute to higher rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among justice-involved individuals. Rapidly identifying new cases in congregate settings is essential to promote proper isolation and quarantine. We sought perspectives of individuals incarcerated during COVID-19 on how to improve carceral infection control and their perspectives on acceptability of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) accompanying individual testing.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 adults who self-reported being incarcerated throughout the United States between March 2020 and May 2021. We asked participants about facility enforcement of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 guidelines, and acceptability of integrating WBS into SARS-CoV-2 monitoring strategies at their most recent facility. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study sample and report on acceptability of WBS. We analyzed qualitative data thematically using an iterative process.
Results
Participants were predominantly Black or multiple races (50%) and men (75%); 46 years old on average. Most received a mask during their most recent incarceration (90%), although only 40% received counseling on proper mask wearing. A quarter of participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at intake. Most (70%) believed they were exposed to the virus while incarcerated. Reoccurring themes included (1) Correctional facility environment leading to a sense of insecurity, (2) Perceptions that punitive conditions in correctional settings were exacerbated by the pandemic; (3) Importance of peers as a source of information about mitigation measures; (4) Perceptions that the safety of correctional environments differed from that of the community during the pandemic; and (5) WBS as a logical strategy, with most (68%) believing WBS would work in the last correctional facility they were in, and 79% preferred monitoring SARS-CoV-2 levels through WBS rather than relying on just individual testing.
Conclusion
Participants supported routine WBS to monitor for SARS-CoV-2. Integrating WBS into existing surveillance strategies at correctional facilities may minimize the impact of future COVID-19 outbreaks while conserving already constrained resources. To enhance the perception and reality that correctional systems are maximizing mitigation, future measures might include focusing on closer adherence to CDC recommendations and clarity about disease pathogenesis with residents.

N2  - Background: Transgender individuals are known to be at a higher risk for certain chronic conditions compared to cisgender individuals. Similarly, research also shows justice-involved individuals have a higher risk of chronic conditions compared to non-justice-involved individuals.Aim: This study aims to investigate the differences in chronic disease diagnoses between transgender and cisgender individuals who either utilized healthcare services provided by a US county health system or who were incarcerated in the same county's jail.Method: We leveraged electronic health record data from a United States county health system, including data from the local jail, to evaluate the difference in diagnosis of certain chronic conditions among transgender and cisgender individuals. We also compared individuals who experienced incarceration and those who did not.Results: We found transgender individuals experiencing recent incarceration were more likely to be diagnosed with substance use disorder, HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis C than cisgender individuals. Transgender individuals not experiencing recent incarceration were more likely to be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, seizure disorder, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder than cisgender individuals.Conclusion: These results highlight how transgender individuals may be disproportionately impacted by certain diseases within and outside carceral settings.

N2  - A recent Letter to the Editor in Anthropology of Consciousness, by Sosteric, Ratkovic, and Sosteric, is positioned as a critique of my article “Imaginal Research for Unlearning Mastery: Divination With Tarot as a Decolonizing Methodology.” The letter posits that the esoteric tarot is a repository of colonial ideological propaganda, and because of that, it cannot and should not be used as a tool for decolonial practices. However, the letter is misleading in its implications that what I have proposed in my article cannot be a methodology for decolonizing mental models, and includes statements about my position which are incorrect. This response clarifies and expands on ideas from my article—both about the tarot and also about the carceral mental models my article attempts to address—in part by highlighting the modern/colonial underpinnings of Sosteric et al.'s critique.

N2  - In this research I interrogate how metrics of food insecurity rely on indexes of deprivation, of which Indigeneity is deemed an indicator of social deprivation. I engage the fields of critical Indigenous studies, critical whiteness studies, and Indigenous science, technology, and society. I argue that social deprivation indexes produce and surveil “deprived” geographic food zones according to metrics of whiteness. I make three central arguments through the empirical context of food insecurity interventions for Indigenous people in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. First, accounting for food insecurity through social deprivation indexes produces food insecurity because it does not accurately depict sources of food outside of what has been deemed appropriate (see: “healthy”) through logics of whiteness. Second, solely imagining food insecurity through logics of social deprivation results in interventions of whiteness, which overdetermines how inner-city urban space is designed, surveilled, and made carceral. Third, if food studies does not interrogate and make serious efforts to undo its own whiteness, it will continue to be deficient in its renderings and understanding of food geographies beyond whiteness.

N2  - Psychiatric and behavior problems are common among children and young adults, and many go without care or only receive treatment in carceral settings. We examined racial and ethnic disparities in children’s and young adults’ receipt of mental health and substance abuse care using nationally representative data from the 2006–2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Blacks’ and Hispanics’ visit rates (and per capita expenditures) were about half those of non-Hispanic whites for all types and definitions of outpatient mental health services. Disparities were generally larger for young adults than for children. Black and white children had similar psychiatric inpatient and emergency department utilization rates, while Hispanic children had lower hospitalization rates. Multivariate control for mental health impairment, demographics, and insurance status did not attenuate racial/ethnic disparities in outpatient care. We conclude that psychiatric and behavioral problems among minority youth often result in school punishment or incarceration, but rarely mental health care.

N2  - Globally, the rate of incarceration among women is rising, and in the U.S., women's incarceration has grown at twice the rate for men over the last four decades. Louisiana has the second highest rate of incarceration in the U.S. There is evidence that men in Louisiana prisons do not receive adequate healthcare, but little is known about their women counterparts. We aimed to document formerly incarcerated women's experiences with receiving healthcare during incarceration in Louisiana to inform policy and practice change. In partnership with two community‐based organisations in New Orleans, Louisiana, between August 2016 and April 2018, we conducted semi‐structured 1‐hr interviews with 22 formerly incarcerated women who had been incarcerated in the state for at least one consecutive year. A convenience sample of participants was recruited through community‐based organisations’ re‐entry and health programmes. Our interview guide included questions about experiences with accessing care, reproductive health needs, interactions with providers and preventive care during incarceration. We used applied thematic analysis techniques to interpret data. Over 90% of interviewees identified as Black. Their mean age was 50.7. The average length of incarceration was 8.4 years. Participants reported multiple barriers to accessing care including punishment for seeking care, long wait times, costs, lack of respect from providers and health concerns being dismissed. Participants reported limited mental health, preventive and dental services; an insufficient number of providers; and poor health outcomes as a result of delayed care. Overall, women did not have access to adequate, timely care during incarceration. Findings suggest a need for policy changes related to the provision of carceral healthcare services and external oversight of prison conditions and healthcare delivery. Further research into women's experiences of ageing during incarceration and tailored transitional health models is needed.

N2  - The discipline of public health has begun to recognize the structural inequities of the carceral system as drivers of poor individual and population health. The number of people incarcerated and the length of their incarceration determine the scope and gravity of their exposure to these individual and public health effects. Plea bargains all but guarantee a period of incarceration, often for many years, because prosecutors have significant bargaining power against defendants who often do not fully understand their rights or the likelihood of receiving the sentences that prosecutors would be seeking in trial. I propose and analyze several pathways through which to eliminate or severely restrict the practice of plea bargaining to minimize the health effects associated with incarceration. I conclude that state legislation would be most feasible and effective at eliminating plea bargains but, without concurrent interventions addressing mandatory minima and/or bail, would not fundamentally address the primary concerns of sentence length and overcrowding.

N2  - In recent years, the US penal system has increasingly contracted prison services and introduced electronic commerce technologies for penal populations and their social networks. This study uses visual and textual analysis of 245 images from the websites of 17 inmate package companies to explore electronic commerce strategies in US penal institutions. The inmate package industry uses electronic commerce strategies that address the distinctive conditions of penal confinement and deploys emotionally charged messages to encourage digital interactions with the penal system and elicit consumption. Several company websites also organize the experience of consumption along gender and racial lines. The emergent industry of inmate packages represents one among several contemporary practices of carceral consumption.

N2  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted individuals in carceral facilities – both incarcerated people and staff. Vaccination is an important tool in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death. While the importance of promoting vaccination is clear, there are considerable barriers to doing so. This study aims to better understand: (1) why individuals chose to receive the COVID-19 vaccine; (2) why individuals were hesitant to vaccinate; (3) what motivators might influence a person’s decision to get vaccinated; and (4) what sources of information about COVID-19 vaccination people trust.
Methods
We conducted a survey of incarcerated people and facility staff in three, large state prisons in Minnesota to identify barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination. Facilities were recruited to participate through purposive sampling, and surveys were administered between November and December 2021. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Stata.
Results
Findings demonstrate that, for incarcerated individuals (
N
 = 1,392), the most common reason for getting vaccinated was to return to normal activities in prison (61%,
n
 = 801); the most common reason for being hesitant to get vaccinated was “other” (41%,
n
 = 342), with individuals citing a variety of concerns. For staff (
N
 = 190), the most common reason for getting vaccinated was to protect the health of family and friends (79%,
n
 = 114); the most common reasons for being hesitant were disbelief that vaccination is necessary (55%,
n
 = 23) and distrust of healthcare and public health systems (55%,
n
 = 23). Incarcerated individuals reported that monetary and programmatic incentives would help motivate them to get vaccinated, while staff members said speaking with healthcare professionals and monetary incentives would help motivate them. Lastly, trusted sources of information for incarcerated individuals were healthcare professionals outside of prisons and jails, along with friends and family members. Staff members reported that they trusted healthcare professionals and national health organizations for information about COVID-19 vaccination.
Conclusions
While considerable barriers to COVID-19 vaccination persist among both incarcerated individuals and staff members, these findings also highlight areas of intervention to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and promote health equity among those disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

N2  - In year one of the COVID-19 epidemic, the incidence of infection for US carceral populations was 5.5-fold higher than that in the community. Prior to the rapid roll out of a comprehensive jail surveillance program of Wastewater-Based Surveillance (WBS) and individual testing for SARS-CoV-2, we sought the perspectives of formerly incarcerated individuals regarding mitigation strategies against COVID-19 to inform acceptability of the new program. In focus groups, participants discussed barriers to their receiving COVID-19 testing and vaccination. We introduced WBS and individual nasal self-testing, then queried if wastewater testing to improve surveillance of emerging outbreaks before case numbers surged, and specimen self-collection, would be valued. The participants’ input gives insight into ways to improve the delivery of COVID-19 interventions. Hearing the voices of those with lived experiences of incarceration is critical to understanding their views on infection control strategies and supports including justice-involved individuals in decision-making processes regarding jail-based interventions.

N2  - Research generally ends with the publication of its results. What happens to it afterward is implicitly viewed as the usual after-sales service of science. Yet its encounter with various audiences, the debates it raises, and the new perspectives it opens can be collectively regarded as an object of inquiry in its own right. In this essay, I embark on an analysis of the public afterlife of ethnography. Rather than promote public social science, I examine what it is, the operations it entails, the questions it poses, and the challenges and limitations it faces. Drawing principally from public engagement with and reception of two recent books on urban policing and the carceral condition in France, I discuss the meaning and significance of afterlife, the multiple configurations of and interactions with publics, and the specific issues related to the publicization of ethnography.

N2  - Background
While the severe detrimental impact of COVID-19 on incarcerated people is well known, little is known about the experience of COVID-19 on those on community supervision. Our objective was to better understand the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and its collateral consequences for those on community supervision (e.g., probation, parole). Beginning in December 2020, we conducted 185 phone surveys about COVID-19 with participants in The Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Study across its three sites - Florida, Kentucky, and North Carolina. We conducted rapid assessment interviews with both closed- and open-ended questions. We calculated descriptive statistics for close-ended questions and conducted a content analysis for open-ended questions.
Results
The COVID-19 pandemic affected those on community supervision through their experiences in the community and while incarcerated with over one-quarter of participants being reincarcerated during this time. In addition to many (128/185) experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, about half (85/185) of participants reported a diagnosis in their network with 16 of those participants losing loved ones to the pandemic. Participants experienced disruptions to their social network, healthcare, and livelihoods. Though many maintained their support systems, others felt isolated and depressed. Experiences during COVID-19 exacerbated difficulties already faced by those with criminal involvement.
Conclusions
The public health community must recognize those experiencing probation and parole, not only those housed in carceral facilities, as disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must tailor programs and services to meet their needs.

N2  - AbstractBackgroundIn custodial settings such as jails and prisons, infectious disease transmission is heightened by factors such as overcrowding and limited healthcare access. Specific features of social contact networks within these settings have not been sufficiently characterized, especially in the context of a large-scale respiratory infectious disease outbreak. The study aims to quantify contact network dynamics within the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, Georgia. MethodsJail roster data were utilized to construct social contact networks. Rosters included resident details, cell locations, and demographic information. This analysis involved 6702 male residents over 140,901 person days. Network statistics, including degree, mixing, and dissolution (movement within and out of the jail) rates, were assessed. We compared outcomes for two distinct periods (January 2022 and April 2022) to understand potential responses in network structures during and after the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant peak. ResultsWe found high cross-sectional network degree at both cell and block levels. While mean degree increased with age, older residents exhibited lower degree during the Omicron peak. Block-level networks demonstrated higher mean degrees than cell-level networks. Cumulative degree distributions increased from January to April, indicating heightened contacts after the outbreak. Assortative age mixing was strong, especially for younger residents. Dynamic network statistics illustrated increased degrees over time, emphasizing the potential for disease spread. ConclusionsDespite some reduction in network characteristics during the Omicron peak, the contact networks within the Fulton County Jail presented ideal conditions for infectious disease transmission. Age-specific mixing patterns suggested unintentional age segregation, potentially limiting disease spread to older residents. This study underscores the necessity for ongoing monitoring of contact networks in carceral settings and provides valuable insights for epidemic modeling and intervention strategies, including quarantine, depopulation, and vaccination, laying a foundation for understanding disease dynamics in such environments.Top of Form

N2  - BACKGROUND:
Adjusting to incarceration is traumatic. An under-utilized strategy understood to buffer and counteract the negative impacts of incarceration are nature interventions.
OBJECTIVE:
Outcomes of an interdisciplinary design studio course focused on developing masterplans for a women’s prison in the Pacific Northwest (US) are presented. Course objectives included comprehension and application of therapeutic and culturally expressive design principles to increase the benefits of environmental design within a carceral setting; collaboration, developing a deeper, more representative understanding of how design processes can improve the lives of marginalized populations; and enhancing design skills, including at masterplan and schematic scale using an iterative process and reflection.
METHODS:
A landscape architect, occupational therapist, and architect teaching team, with support from architects and justice specialists facilitated an elective design studio course to redesign the Washington Corrections Center for Women campus.
RESULTS:
In a ten-week academic quarter, six student design teams created conceptual masterplans for therapeutic outdoor spaces at the Washington Corrections Center for Women. Students presented their plans to prison staff, current and ex-offenders, and architects and landscape architects in practice, and then received positive feedback.
CONCLUSION:
Despite well-documented need for and value of nature interventions to improve health and wellbeing for everyone regardless of circumstance or situation, the project awaits administrative approval to move forward to installation.

N2  - The economic enclaves that are being built across South India would appear to exemplify what Aihwa Ong has called ‘neoliberalism as exception’. Drawing on fieldwork in and around one ‘special economic zone’ in the state of Andhra Pradesh, this article critiques the language of exceptionality by exploring the structural continuities and dynamic interconnections between the zone and what continues to be called the ‘informal economy’. Rather than valorize India’s economic zones as manifestations of a juridical-discursive ‘exception’ in which the state experiments with alternative forms of market-oriented rule or as carceral spaces in which working populations are subjected to innovations in bio-political government this article shows how these zones formalize conditions of precariousness and political subjectivity that already characterize working life in much of South India, incorporating social networks and livelihoods that extend beyond their walls.

N2  - The management of south-to-south workers' migration and their lives remains an important issue in many circles as hundreds of thousands of these low-income migrant workers are often 'positioned' in precarious economic and social situations. This thesis develops a Critical Management Studies (CMS) focus to show that there are inherent power disparities and potential for worker exploitation in these practices. Based on an ethnographic study of the Asia to Abu Dhabi migration corridor this thesis explores the techniques of disciplinary power in the management of the low-income migrant worker. This thesis demonstrates that the low-income migrant worker is a deeply subjugated subject who is disciplined to live a responsible life of docility and work, and where his/her 'life' is deferred until they return home on vacation, or return at the end of their contract. There is also evidence of a 'diagram of power' that I term the Carceral Net, in which the techniques of disciplinary power are found to be juxtaposed with sovereign, social/juridical, and security technologies of power. However, despite the tight grip of the Carceral Net, there is a unique form of support that emerges through a localised set of daily practices where the worker (within interstitial spaces) strives to cope with life, and live life with his/her X-Family.

N2  - As COVID-19 sweeps across the country, individuals within the carceral system face an increased risk of contracting the virus, and as a result, heightened risk for mental health symptoms. We discuss how COVID-19 appears to be exacerbating mental health inequities for children within the carceral system and the need to respond accordingly. Children within the carceral system represent a particularly vulnerable population, and the majority of detained or confined youth identify as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). As juvenile detention centers in multiple states report cases of COVID-19, children who are confined are experiencing higher rates of illness and fear of illness. It is crucial to consider how the mental health of children who are confined will be disproportionately affected compared with the general population. We provide recommendations to revise practices to improve and reduce mental health outcomes among confined children.

N2  - Compared to the general population, individuals incarcerated in jails and prisons are more vulnerable to infection and mortality from communicable diseases, such as COVID-19 and influenza. However, vaccination rates among incarcerated individuals as well as staff who work in jails and prisons remain disproportionately low. Healthcare administrators working in jails have first-hand experience about barriers to vaccine provision, but their perspectives are infrequently collected and analyzed.
We reached out to Health Services Administrators (HSAs) from all 14 Massachusetts (MA) county jails for qualitative in-depth interviews to understand how their personal and professional feelings about vaccination relate to the barriers and facilitators that surround administration of vaccines in jail.
Eight people participated in the study (8/14 = 57% response rate). Key themes emerged, including 1) HSAs expressed divergent opinions on incarceration as the correct opportunity to vaccinate individuals, 2) HSAs' personal views on vaccines influenced their operationalization of vaccination in jail, and 3) opinions varied on whether their institutions' vaccine protocols needed modification.
Our findings highlight the critical need to leverage the feedback and influence of stakeholders such as HSAs in efforts to improve preventative healthcare delivery in carceral health systems.

N2  - Illicit opioid use and opioid use disorder (OUD) are public health crises that often lead individuals to encounter the criminal justice system. Illegally manufactured fentanyl contaminates much of the illicit drug supply, including opioids and stimulants, leading to unintentional drug overdoses. Access to evidence-based treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and an opioid overdose reversal agent (OORA) is paramount to preventing overdose deaths. However, few jails or prisons in the state of Arkansas currently provide access to or education about these evidence-based medications. One strategy to increase evidence-based medication utilization within a carceral setting is to engage pharmacists, who are under-utilized healthcare professionals and who have considerable expertise in MOUD and OORA. There is currently limited evidence to support pharmacists' roles within a jail setting. With federal and state opioid response funding, we are conducting the Pharmacist-Led Interventions to Increase Access to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (PLI-MOUD) study. This randomized controlled study evaluated the preliminary efficacy of pharmacist-led interventions to expand knowledge and access to MOUD among individuals identified with a history of symptoms suggestive of OUD. In addition, it aims to assess knowledge and confidence in OORA among individuals with a history of symptoms suggestive of stimulant use disorder alone or in combination with OUD, who are currently incarcerated and enrolled in an established Re-Entry program within a single county regional detention facility. The three aims of the study include (1) assessment of the prevalence of OUD symptoms and racial/ethnic differences within this unique study setting, (2) comparison of the effectiveness of a naloxone administration training intervention delivered by a pharmacist versus an Alcohol and Drug Counselor (ADC), and (3) compare the effectiveness of two pharmacist-delivered MOUD education interventions, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment versus standard medication counseling.

N2  - Reflecting on in this issue, this commentary extends our consideration of issues in carceral health and questions the dehumanizing language we sometimes use-including in public health and public health ethics-to talk about persons held in incarceration. Even the language we use for the carceral system itself (such as 'criminal justice system') is fraught: it casts a laudatory light on the system and papers over its role in compounding racial health inequities and in sustaining colonialism. A host of issues call out for ethical analysis, using lenses that can encompass the tensions and contradictions experienced by people within the system who deliver healthcare and those within the system trying to access that care. Beyond access to health care (promotion, prevention, treatment and palliation), the societal commitment to dealing with social issues by depriving people of many key social determinants of health is at the heart of many of these tensions and contradictions.

N2  - The emotional experiences of incarceration are directly tied to state‐sanctioned gendered violence. Most incarcerated women have a history of trauma, stemming directly from broader socio‐political and economic forces, which is further rendered throughout the incarceration and reentry process. The carceral system in the United States disrupts family and social support systems, fails to provide accessible and adequate mental health and substance use services, and denies stabilization resources such as housing, employment, and citizenry for women once released from prison, yet their emotional experiences are largely absent in analyses of this gendered violence. Drawing from a larger intimate ethnography project with a woman, LaTasha, recently released from a 25‐year to life prison sentence, this article examines how women negotiate and express emotions within the context of prison reentry contributing to feminist anthropological scholarship on state‐sanctioned gender violence. Through an in‐depth analysis of the challenges LaTasha faces in rebuilding relationships with family, navigating a system in which she has been outcasted, and asserting herself after being systematically disempowered, we gain insight into the ways in which carceral systems have prevented emotional complexity resulting in a form of incipient and largely invisible violence.

N2  - Residents of South Texas live in a "Constitution free zone," as one of our informants explained. Court rulings have declared that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution does not apply at checkpoints and spaces up to 100 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border. This article draws upon Agamben's arguments about "states of exception" and Foucault's notion of the "carceral state" to show that border residents live in a state of legal exception, in which the modalities characteristic of mass incarceration are extended from prison, where search and seizure is always classified as "reasonable," into everyday life. We introduce the concept "state of carcelment" to describe how these modalities operate on the ground, through mass incarceration and internal checkpoints, to inter, so to speak, an entire region. With the potential diffusion of this "state of carcelment" beyond the border region, anthropologists are poised to critically engage its legal and cultural normalization.

N2  - Much of the American response to the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by a divergence between general public opinion and public health policy. With little attention paid to individuals incarcerated during this time, there is limited direct evidence regarding how incarcerated people perceived efforts to mediate the harms of COVID-19. Prisons operate as a microcosm of society in many ways but they also face unique public health challenges. This study examines vaccine hesitancy-and acceptance-among a sample of individuals incarcerated within adult prisons in Pennsylvania. Using administrative records as well as rich attitudinal data from a survey of the incarcerated population, this study identifies a variety of social and historical factors that are-and are not-associated with an incarcerated person's willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings highlight vaccination challenges unique to the carceral context and offer policy recommendations to improve trust in credible health messengers and health service provision for this often overlooked but vulnerable population.

N2  - Prisons are the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports have focused on whether transfers of incarcerated people between prisons have been the source of outbreaks. Our objective was to examine the relationship between intersystem prison transfers and COVID-19 incidence in a state prison system. We assessed the change in the means of the time-series of prison transfers and their cross-correlation with the time-series of COVID-19 tests and cases. Regression with automatic detection of multiple change-points was used to identify important changes to transfers. There were over 20,000 transfers between the state’s prisons from January through October 2020. Most who were transferred (82%), experienced a single transfer. Transfers between prisons are positively related to future COVID-19 case rates but transfers are not reactive to current case rates. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in carceral settings, it is crucial for transfers of individuals between facilities to be limited.

N2  - The continued use of solitary confinement has sparked international public health and human rights criticisms and concerns. This carceral practice has been linked repeatedly to a range of serious psychological harms among incarcerated persons. Vulnerabilities to harm are especially dire for persons with preexisting serious mental illness (“SMI”), a group that is overrepresented in solitary confinement units. Although there have been numerous calls for the practice to be significantly reformed, curtailed, and ended altogether, few strategies exist to minimize its use for people with SMI and histories of violence against themselves or others. This case study describes the “Oregon Resource Team” (ORT), a pilot project adapted from a Norwegian officer-led, interdisciplinary team-based approach to reduce isolation and improve outcomes for incarcerated persons with SMI and histories of trauma, self-injury, and violence against others. We describe the ORT’s innovative approach, the characteristics and experiences of incarcerated people who participated in it, its reported impact on the behavior, health, and well-being of incarcerated persons and correctional staff, and ways to optimize its effectiveness and expand its use.

N2  - Research suggests that women of color (WOC) survivors are often dissatisfied with police response to their calls for intimate partner violence (IPV) assistance due to disrespectful, apathetic, and rude treatment. A strong empirical relationship exists between severity of abuse and police help-seeking among WOC survivors more generally; however, scarce literature exists examining the nature of interactions between officers and WOC survivors during life-threatening abuse situations. This study contributes to the literature by examining WOC's satisfaction with law enforcement response  within an interpersonal justice framework, and how survivors' "severe abuse contexts" contribute to police help-seeking decision-making. In-depth interviews were conducted with high-risk WOC IPV survivors. Results revealed two themes that describe participants' perceptions of police treatment as dismissive/lethargic (T1) and hostile/callous (T2). Findings suggest that unfair treatment from officers has dangerous implications for ongoing survivor safety among WOC. Non-carceral IPV prevention and survivor safety enhancement perspectives are also discussed.

N2  - Background: Worldwide more than ten million people are detained at any given time. Between 5 and 60% of people experiencing incarceration report receipt of a tattoo in prison - mostly clandestine, which is associated with risks of blood-borne infections (BBIs). Although safer tattooing techniques are effective in preventing BBI transmission and available to the general population, there is limited knowledge about the impact of safer tattooing strategies in prisons in terms of health outcomes, changes in knowledge and behaviors, and best practice models for implementation. The objective of this research was to identify and review safer tattooing interventions.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Studies of all design types were included if they were published until 27 June 2018, the population was incarcerated adults, they reported quantitative outcomes, and were published in English, French, or Spanish.
Results: Of 55 papers retrieved from the initial search, no peer-reviewed article was identified. One paper from the grey literature described a multi-site pilot project in Canada. Its evaluation suggested that the project was effective in enhancing knowledge of incarcerated people and prison staff on standard precautions, had the potential to reduce harm, provided vocational opportunities, and was feasible although enhancements were needed to improve implementation issues and efficiency.
Conclusions: Although access to preventive services, including to safer tattooing interventions, is a human right and recommended by United Nations agencies as part of a comprehensive package of harm reduction interventions in prisons, this review identified only a few promising strategies for safer tattooing interventions in carceral settings. We call upon governments, criminal justice authorities, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions to implement safer tattooing projects that adhere to the following guiding principles: i) integration of methodologically-rigorous implementation research; ii) involvement of key stakeholders (incarcerated people, prison authorities, research partners) in the project design, implementation, and research; iii) integration into a comprehensive package of BBI prevention, treatment, and care, using a stepwise approach that considers local resources and acceptability; and iv) publication and dissemination of findings, and scaling up efforts.

Densely populated by individuals with multiple social and biological risk factors, prison environments are ideal for tuberculosis transmission. The guidelines only briefly mention prisoners among other risk groups in whom tuberculosis infection testing and treatment “may be considered,” which is a “conditional recommendation” and insufficient to promote policy change. [...]very few countries with high tuberculosis burden routinely provide tuberculosis infection testing and treatment in prisons.

N2  - Banned Books Week is a hallmark tradition among US-based librarians and the American Library Association. Yet, the ALA and librarians across the profession are excluding the most significant and egregious violations of intellectual freedom and access to literature and information in our so-called free society – the US prison system. In this essay, the author discusses the significance of carceral book banning and why libraries’ interest divergence from social and prison justice movements are counterproductive and uphold systems of racial injustice.

N2  - Importance Length of custody is a mechanism by which carceral systems can worsen health. However, there are fewer studies examining US immigration detention, in large part because US immigration detention is largely privately operated and opaque by design. Objectives To examine the association between duration spent in US immigration detention with subsequent health outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used a referral sample of recently detained immigrants who were released from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a series of court orders in 2020 and 2021. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to October 2024. Exposure Detention duration less than 6 months vs 6 months or longer. Main Outcomes and Measures We used multivariable regression analysis to assess the association of detention duration and several variables: (1) self-rated health, (2) mental illness (Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale), and (3) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Primary Care-PTSD-5 Screen). We then calculated the likelihood of experiencing each outcome, controlling for covariates. As a robustness check, we conducted sensitivity analyses with detention duration as a continuous measure. Results The study included 200 respondents (mean [SD] age, 40.3 [10.1] years; 175 male [87.5%]; 149 Hispanic or Latino ethnicity [74.5%]). Results revealed a high prevalence of poor self-rated health, mental illness, and PTSD for all respondents, but especially among those who had been detained for 6 months or longer, who had significantly higher likelihood of poor or fair self-rated health (49.1% [95% CI, 40.5%-57.6%] vs 30.4% [95% CI, 21.8%-39.1%]; P < .001), mental illness (37.0% [95% CI, 28.2%-45.8%] vs 20.7% [95% CI, 12.6%-28.7%]; P < .001), and PTSD (59.3% [95% CI, 50.3%-68.3%] vs 34.8% [95% CI, 25.3%-44.3%]; P < .001). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the general robustness of these findings, with longer detention duration significantly associated with mental illness (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.20]; P = .01) and PTSD (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.03-1.20]; P = .005) in our adjusted models. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, detained immigrants experienced a high prevalence of poor health, mental illness, and PTSD, with detention periods of 6 months or more associated with higher rates compared with those detained less than 6 months. Duration of custody is one mechanism by which immigration detention might be a catalyst for worsening health.

N2  - The perspective of intersectionality has gained widespread scholarly interest and been employed across many different disciplines, including criminology. This perspective focuses on interlocking systems of oppression and the need to work toward structural changes to promote social justice and equity. The present article aimed to explore the potential of intersectionality for advancing health research and policy regarding justice-involved women, in different phases of the judicial process, based on the extant literature.
First, employing an intersectional approach to analyze the issue of health during the pre-incarceration period may facilitate identification of the structural and representational factors underlying the barriers that women face in obtaining health services, which elevates the risk to their health. Furthermore, adopting an intersectionality perspective to explore women’s health during incarceration may shed light on vulnerable, invisible subpopulations of women such as incarcerated older women and their health problems, and help identify the structural barriers to carceral health services and the role of stigma in inflicting and normalizing harmful practices within prison walls. In addition, an intersectionality lens highlights the risk of unintended use of scholarly knowledge regarding the health of justice-involved women. Last, an intersectionality perspective is particularly relevant for research of the reentry of justice-involved women. In particular, it can be used to examine gender-sensitive reentry services that ignore other axes of marginalization, such as class and race, generating a powerful dynamic that results in partial service, denial of access to therapeutic resources, and possible exposure to health-damaging environments.
Through an exploration of the extant literature on justice-involved women, I endeavored to demonstrate that an intersectional framework offers powerful tools to both challenge and strengthen gender frameworks within criminology. This will make it possible to move beyond consideration of gender alone, to understand how systems of oppression based on race, age and other social locations intersect and combine to construct health disadvantages among justice-involved women. This highlights the needs for a new research agenda and policy that integrate the intersectional framework with health theories to provide a more developed understanding of health among justice-involved women.

N2  - Women in prison experience a double digital divide, due to gendered discrimination and carceral isolation. We focus on a recent policy change in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, whereby digital devices were provided to incarcerated people. This policy change is considered in light of women’s trauma histories and the importance of community and family connection. We respond to themes presented at the United Nations’ Sixty-Seventh Session on the Commission of the Status of Women, specifically achieving equality and empowerment for all women and girls in the digital age. Incarcerated women must be prioritized when addressing the gendered digital divide.

N2  - Background
The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted incarcerated populations, yet few studies have investigated the specific effects on incarcerated pregnant people. This study compares pregnant people’s experiences of pregnancy and parenting in prison before and during the pandemic in order to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on this population.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with pregnant people at a state prison as part of a larger study on pregnant people’s experiences during incarceration. Interviews explored participants’ experiences and decision-making related to pregnancy and parenting while incarcerated. This secondary analysis compared interviews conducted between June 2019 and March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) to interviews conducted between June and November 2020 (during COVID-19). Interviews conducted during the pandemic included questions about the impact of COVID-19 on participants’ experiences. Brief three and six-month follow-up interviews were conducted when possible.
Results
COVID-19 introduced new stressors and exacerbated preexisting stressors around participants’ reproductive and parenting experiences. Three major themes emerged: 1) incarceration causes mental, emotional, and physical distress during pregnancy and parenting; 2) COVID-19 worsened conditions of incarceration, contributing to participants’ distress; and 3) the introduction of quarantine protocols during the pandemic felt uniquely punitive for pregnant and postpartum people.
Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic was characterized as a major crisis and primary threat to public health, particularly for incarcerated individuals. Yet just as COVID-19 exacerbated preexisting disparities for marginalized, non-incarcerated communities, incarcerated pregnant people similarly described a “worsening” of already-intolerable conditions. The indiscriminate application of quarantine protocols for pregnant people reflects broader carceral logics of control that do not account for the wellbeing of pregnant and postpartum people and their infants, as evidenced by current practices of infant separation, a lack of support, and physically taxing living conditions.

N2  - Pervasive carceral conditions are being met with a range of efforts to make what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls “freedom as a place.” What does it mean to create such places? We answer here by taking seriously the methodological demands of how we do abolition work in the academy. Abolition methodologies entail a responsibility to bridge the spaces between academic and community work focused on resisting and building alternatives to carcerality. Taking our lead from organizers embedded in communities of practice and care, we see abolition methodologies as an opportunity to pursue a range of artistic, educational, and politically strategic scholar and scholar-activist works. Inspired by Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang’s understanding that refusals can offer imaginative alternatives, we present four principles of abolitionist methodologies grounded in generative acts of refusal. These include abolition as reorientation, as contextual, as livingness, and as relational. To illustrate these principles in action, we discuss our efforts in the Prison Agriculture Lab to develop creative works and beneficial tools that, we hope, will help upend racial capitalism and advance the practice of abolition in daily life.

N2  - SummaryBackgroundMass incarceration has collateral consequences for community health, which are reflected in county-level health indicators, including county mortality rates. County jail incarceration rates are associated with all-cause mortality rates in the USA. We assessed the causes of death that drive the relationship between county-level jail incarceration and mortality. MethodsIn this retrospective, longitudinal study, we assessed the association between county-level jail incarceration rates and county-level cause-specific mortality using county jail incarceration data (1987–2017) for 1094 counties in the USA obtained from the Vera Institute of Justice and cause-specific mortality data for individuals younger than 75 years in the total county population (1988–2018) obtained from the US National Vital Statistics System. We fitted quasi-Poisson models for nine common causes of death (cerebrovascular disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, heart disease, infectious disease, malignant neoplasm, substance use, suicide, and unintentional injury) with county fixed effects, controlling for all unmeasured stable county characteristics and measured time-varying confounders (county median age, county poverty rate, county percentage of Black residents, county crime rate, county unemployment rate, and state incarceration rate). We lagged county jail incarceration rates by 1 year to assess the short-term, by 5 years to assess the medium-term, and by 10 years to assess the long-term associations of jail incarceration with premature mortality. FindingsA 1 per 1000 within-county increase in jail incarceration rate was associated with a 6·5% increase in mortality from infectious diseases (risk ratio 1·065, 95% CI 1·061–1·070), a 4·9% increase in mortality from chronic lower respiratory disease (1·049, 1·045–1·052), a 2·6% increase in mortality induced from substance use (1·026, 1·020–1·032), a 2·5% increase in suicide mortality (1·025, 1·020–1·029), and smaller increases in mortality from heart disease (1·021, 1·019–1·023), unintentional injury (1·015, 1·011–1·018), malignant neoplasm (1·014, 1·013–1·016), diabetes (1·013, 1·009–1·018), and cerebrovascular disease (1·010, 1·007–1·013) after 1 year. Associations between jail incarceration and cause-specific mortality rates weakened as time lags increased, but to a greater extent for causes of death with generally shorter latency periods (infectious disease and suicide) than for those with generally longer latency periods (heart disease, malignant neoplasm, and cerebrovascular disease). InterpretationJail incarceration rates are potential drivers of many causes of death in US counties. Jail incarceration can be harmful not only to the health of individuals who are incarcerated, but also to public health more broadly. Our findings suggest important points of intervention, including disinvestment from carceral systems and investment in social and public health services, such as community-based treatment of substance-use disorders.

N2  - This article introduces the “racial environmental state” as an analytical framework for examining race and environment as mutually constituting modes of state power. Under racial capitalism, the state relies on the constant articulation of racial and environmental difference and domination to sustain the uneven geographies necessary for capitalism. The racial environmental state offers a way to examine hegemonic state power operating through the convergences of race and environment, as a site for resistance, and the proliferation of abolition geographies. Using this framework, the author analyzes the abolitionist struggle to transform the carceral geographies of California’s Central Valley through a campaign to stop the construction of a prison in Delano, California. This case study shows the importance of recognizing race and environment as interconnected systems of domination and resistance. It also highlights the possibilities and limitations of engaging the state in the abolitionist fight for freedom.

N2  - This intervention considers uneven development and social reproduction within racial capitalism. Social reproduction refers to the range of practices that form the conditions of possibility for the life of capital, as well as life and death within racial capitalism. This spans a range of institutions and networks within households, communities, states and across national borders as well as the labour practices, relations and organization that reproduce racial capitalism. Here, we examine the extraction of time, taking up theorizations across carceral geographies, postcolonial theory and Caribbean studies to demonstrate how coercive relations of social reproduction contribute to uneven development. In particular, we look at the role of the state in racial capital’s capture of reproductive activities across our work on electric utilities in Atlanta, Georgia and extralegal land tenure on Jamaica’s north coast. In bringing these distinct sites into conversation, we re-affirm the need to study uneven development by understanding how the circulation and accumulation of capital is imbricated with the production of hierarchies of all kinds of difference. We show how a conjunctural countertopography can reveal how state practices advance accumulation under conditions of widespread surplus lives, as capital wagers on captive life and premature death.

N2  - Why is the police role so broad in the United States today? Carceral state scholars have investigated how and why policymakers have treated so many social problems as policing problems, but they have not yet recognized the degree to which the call-for-service system has marginalized political control over police strategy. This Article traces the historical sources of this arrangement through extensive archival research into its evolution. We find that over the course of the twentieth century, the rise of new communications technologies gradually shifted the power to decide which problems are proper subjects of police attention to private individuals, eventually channeling their demands through centralized call centers that had been stripped of the authority and contextual knowledge needed to govern them in a meaningful way. That process fundamentally altered the character of public oversight over policing, elevating a distinctive set of individual interests as largely unchallenged determinants of the kinds of situations that are policeable. By illustrating how sociotechnical change unintentionally reallocated the authority to define the scope of an important institution’s mandate, this case sheds new light on the factors that shape the police role and the role the public plays in defining it.

N2  - Between 1974 and 1988, the revolutionary ruling party of Mozambique, Frelimo, launched several campaigns to cleanse the cities of residents it deemed antisocial and antithetical to the socialist revolution in Mozambique. The party established over twenty internment camps in remote locations throughout the country. Officially called ‘reeducation centers’, these camps were meant to rehabilitate wayward members of society through forced labor, political education, and moral regeneration. This study offers a critical historical examination of the cleanup campaigns and reeducation camps in socialist Mozambique. It explores the ideological and material infrastructure in which Frelimo devised and implemented its program of moral reform. Building on a new set of archival materials and interviews, the study foregrounds the contradictions of Frelimo’s ambitions and the gap between the ideals of social reform and the reality of the internment regimen. The examination of the campaigns, the empirical documentation of the organic functioning of the camps and the everyday life of internment shed light on the inner workings of authority and power, social control, and the carceral regime in contexts of austerity and national political transition. The study argues that the party’s incapacity to transmute the salvationist ideas of social reform into planned action produced spaces of social neglect and castigation that affected both the inmates and the personnel tasked to discipline and re-educate them. The conditions of austerity in which Frelimo implemented its reformist project produced a particular mode of a carceral regime that was not dictated by technologies of disciplinary surveillance. Camp supervisors and detainees themselves defined the kind of internment regimen that prevailed in the camps in ways that subverted the disciplinary aspirations of political leaders. While the party leaders envisioned the camps as sites of disciplinary pedagogy for the making of the new man and the new woman, in fact, the camps were spaces of social abandonment.

N2  - Background: Correctional workers are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, determined the effects of carceral and occupational exposures on seropositivity, and explored predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among correctional workers in Quebec, Canada.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in three provincial prisons. The primary and secondary outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 antibody seropositivity (Roche Elecsys (R) serology test) and self-reported COVID-19 vaccination status ("fully vaccinated" defined as two doses or prior infection plus one dose), respectively. Poisson regression models with robust standard error were used to examine the effect of occupational variables with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Estimates are presented as crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Results: From 14 July to 15 November 2021, 105/600 (18%) correctional workers tested positive across three prisons (range 11-21%); 76% were fully vaccinated. Seropositivity was affected by prison occupation (aPR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11-2.27 for correctional officers vs. all other occupations) and low perceived concern of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aPR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.38 for not/hardly worried vs. somewhat/extremely worried). Predictors of being fully vaccinated included race/ethnicity (aPR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.99 for visible minority vs. White), presence of comorbidities (aPR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28 for >= 2 vs. none), and prison occupation (aPR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.92 for correctional officers vs. all other occupations).
Conclusions: Correctional officers were most likely to have acquired SARS-CoV-2, but least likely to be vaccinated, underscoring the importance of addressing both occupational risks and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy to mitigate future outbreaks.

N2  - Background & aims
The COVID-19 pandemic created intersecting health risks for incarcerated people with a history of substance use disorder (SUD). To reduce exposure to COVID-19 in prison, several US states enacted decarceration legislation. New Jersey enacted the Public Health Emergency Credit Act (PHECA), granting early release to thousands of incarcerated persons meeting eligibility criteria. This study undertook to explore how large scale decarceration during the pandemic impacted the reentry process for released individuals with SUDs.
Methods
Twenty seven participants involved in PHECA releases – 21 persons released from NJ carceral facilities with past/present SUDs (14 with opioid use disorder, 7 with other SUDs) and 6 reentry service providers acting as key informants – completed phone interviews on PHECA experiences from February–June 2021. Cross-case thematic analysis of transcripts identified common themes and divergent perspectives.
Results
Respondents described challenges consistent with long-documented reentry difficulties including housing and food insecurity, difficulty accessing community services, insufficient employment opportunities, and limited access to transportation. Challenges that were pertinent to mass release during a pandemic included limited access to communication technology and community providers and community providers exceeding enrollment capacity. Despite reentry difficulties, respondents identified many areas where prisons and reentry service providers adapted to meet novel challenges presented by mass decarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Facilitators made available by prison and reentry provider staff included providing released persons with cell phones, transportation assistance at transit hubs, prescription support for medications for opioid use disorder, and pre-release assistance with ID and benefits through NJ’s Joint Comprehensive Assessment Plan.
Conclusions
Formerly incarcerated people with SUDs experienced reentry challenges during PHECA releases similar to those that occur during ordinary circumstances. Despite barriers faced during typical releases and novel challenges unique to mass release during a pandemic, providers made adaptations to support released persons' successful reentry. Recommendations are made based on areas of need identified in interviews, including reentry service provision facilitating housing and food security, employment, medical services, technology fluency, and transportation. In anticipation of future large scale releases, providers will benefit from planning ahead and adapting to address temporary increases in resource demands.

N2  - Drawing upon both ethnographic research and genealogical analysis, this book represents the first in-depth scientific analysis of criminal offenders' electronic monitoring (EM) in Latin America's largest country. It focuses on three empirical axes: 1) the implementation of EM policies against the backdrop of Brazil's collapsing carceral system; 2) the discourses and rationalities which undergird the deployment of EM; and 3) the effects of EM upon convicts moving back and forth between penal institutions and urban spaces governed by armed militias, criminal gangs, and abusive police forces.The book is ideal for researchers and practitioners concerned with the fields of criminal justice and public security all over the world.

N2  - Telehealth is a great tool that makes accessing healthcare easier for those incarcerated and can help with reentry into the the community. Justice impacted individuals face many hardships including adverse health outcomes which can be mitigated through access to telehealth services and providers. During the federally recognized COVID-19 pandemic the need for accessible healthcare was exacerbated and telehealth use surged. While access to telehealth should be considered a necessity, there are many challenges and barriers for justice impacted individuals to be able to utilize this service. This perspective examines aspects of accessibility, pandemic, policy, digital tools, and ethical and social considerations of telehealth in correctional facilities. Carceral facilities should continue to innovate and invest in telehealth to revolutionize healthcare delivery, and improve health outcomes for justice impacted individuals.

N2  - The silver handcuffs that encompassed the young Black woman's wrists restricted her from moving her visibly worn-out mask up her nose. She stated that she had not yet been able to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine and had not been tested in more than two weeks. As an emergency medical technician, Ankita Patil was dispatched to the local prison that was hidden in the corner of the town, and this was her first exposure to the inhumane conditions carceral settings enforce and conceal from the public.Jails and prisons quickly became a hotspot for COVID-19 and involved the largest and most frequent outbreaks in the United States. The virus spread rapidly through carceral facilities as a result of difficulties in practicing social distancing and adhering to mask mandates, along with a lack of engineering controls (e.g., air conditioning). Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) workplace complaints rose by more than 15% between February and October 2020, with the majority revolving around unacceptable COVID-19 workplace conditions that essential workers had to endure1 however, this metric did not extend to the voices of incarcerated populations, who have been vital to the functioning of our society but have not received proper protection.

N2  - This article aims to frame the state violence and socio-ecological injustice perpetrated against prisoners through the lens of both critical environmental justice studies and the concept of the Wasteocene. We seek to uncover the socio-ecological relationships that have historically shaped the enforcement of the prison and waste systems through a focus on the Italian context during the Covid-19 pandemic. We explore the case of a jail in Campania, a region in the South of Italy infamous for its troubled waste management that has caused uncountable and entangled health, social, and economic harms. The jail is adjacent to an area with a long history of waste disposal practices and numerous legal conflicts and corruption scandals: all characteristics that make this case emblematic of the broader problem of carceral environmental injustice. We argue that carceral institutions are generative sites for examining the dynamics of violence, expendability, and wasting relationships that are built into their structures and core functions We also maintain that the Covid-19 pandemic has both uncovered and exacerbated such dynamics and therefore stands as a framing device that further corroborates our argument. We conclude with lessons and observations for scholars studying environmental concerns and carceral systems through a multidisciplinary lens.

N2  - This paper focuses on the coerced mobilities associated with reporting, meaning the mandatory requirement to regularly check-in with authorities for the purpose of control. Drawing on recent calls for a politics of mobility and advances in carceral geographies, we attend to the forces, movements, speeds and affective materialities of reporting with a focus on deportable migrants and the UK Home Office. In doing so we develop two conceptual lenses through which to further understand the politics of mobility. First, we develop the concept of 'slickness' in the context of the process of becoming detained at a reporting event. We understand slickness as a property of bodies and objects that makes them easier to move. Second, we argue that reporting functions to 'tether' deportable migrants; thereby not only fixing them in place, but also forcing the expenditure of energy and the experience of punishment. The result is that reporting blurs the distinction between detention and 'freedom' by enacting the carceral in everyday spaces.

N2  - Technological linkages between justice and law enforcement agencies are radically altering criminal process and access to justice for prisoners. Video links, integral to an increasingly networked justice matrix, enable the custodial appearance of prisoners in remote courts and are becoming the dominant form of court appearance for incarcerated defendants. This book argues that the incorporation of such technologies into prisons is not without consequence: technologies make a critical difference to prisoners’ experiences of criminal justice.
By focusing on the prison endpoint and engaging with the population most affected by video links – the prisoners themselves – this book interrogates the legal and conceptual shifts brought about by the technology’s displacement of physical court appearance. The central argument is that custodial appearance has created a heightened zone of demarcation between prisoners and courtroom participants. This demarcation is explored through transformed spatial, corporeal and visual relationships. Cumulative demarcations challenge procedural justice and profoundly recompose prisoners’ legal experiences in ways not necessarily recognised by policy-makers.

N2  - Abstract
Scientists increasingly seek to respond to urgent calls for equity in science but may be unsure how to engage with underserved public groups. Prisons, jails, and detention centers are venues in which scientists may use their educational privilege to serve and empower diverse populations that are underserved by science education and underrepresented in science disciplines. We reversed the lens that traditionally focuses on the benefits of public engagement to the audience by documenting the impacts of delivering science lectures on the scientists who offered seminars to incarcerated people. The scientists who engaged in carceral settings gained professional benefits, shifted their preconceptions of incarcerated people, raised their perceived value of community engagement, and increased their interest in social justice. Some took direct actions for social change. This program could model effective engagement for other underserved groups in our society. We provide guidance to initiate such a program in other institutions.

N2  - The carceral boom in post-Civil Rights America results not from profit-seeking but from state-crafting. Accordingly, we must slay the chimera of the "Prison Industrial Complex" and forsake its derived tale of the "Prisoner Reentry Industry." This murky economic metaphor is doubly misleading: first, most released convicts experience not reentry but ongoing circulation between the prison and their dispossessed neighborhoods; second, the institutions entrusted with supervising them are not market operators but elements of the bureaucratic field as characterized by Pierre Bourdieu. Post-custodial supervision is a ceremonial component of "prisonfare," which complements "workfare" through organizational isomorphism, and partakes of the neoliberal reengineering of the state. Reentry outfits are not an antidote to but an extension of punitive containment as government technique for managing problem categories and territories in the dualizing city. To capture the glaring economic irrationality and bureaucratic absurdities of the oversight of felons behind as well as beyond bars, our theoretical inspiration should come not from the radical critique of capitalism but from the neo-Durkheimian sociology of organization and the neo-Weberian theory of the state as a classifying and stratifying agency.

N2  - The modern instantiation of migrant family detention in the United States has resulted in the creation of carceral spaces in which conflict and care intermingle in everyday encounters. While legal advocates traversing these spaces offer critical aid to the detained, asylum-seeking parents and children confined within, legal advocacy is rarely recognized as caregiving work. Drawing from my ethnographic research with voluntary legal advocates working at family detention facilities in South Texas, this article demonstrates the potential for deploying a lens of care to such encounters, which I ultimately frame as “legal care.” I argue that cross-disciplinary conceptualizations of care, which emphasize its interdependency, relationality, and contested terrains (Puig de la Bellacasa 2017), as well as its practices as being marked by a continuous tinkering (Mol 2010), offer windows to reconfigurations of care and power that reside amid both the mundane and unpredictable frictions that characterize these environments.

N2  - Black women and girls (BWGs) face an elevated risk of being killed by police, yet few studies have focused on the proximal factors increasing their exposure to these deadly encounters.
This paper elucidates the determinants and features of fatal police encounters with BWGs over a 20-year period. We examined (1) the initial cause of police contact, (2) how the encounter unfolded and escalated to a fatality, and (3) trends in factors salient to how each case transpired.
Using the Fatal Encounters database, we identified 573 BWGs killed between 2000 and 2019. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we leveraged case descriptions and triangulated with news articles, police reports, legal documents, and other texts about decedents to determine what happened in each case, why, and to what effect.
While many fatal police encounters were precipitated by alleged criminal activity, a significant number were due to minor violations, public health crises, and domestic violence. Moreover, most BWGs were not the target of the police activity that ultimately killed them, and their deaths came as collateral damage from the aggressive policing of others.
As the US continues to grapple with the role of policing in community safety, this work complicates the understanding of how police operate and impact communities, raising questions about how to effectively address root causes beyond carceral and punitive frameworks.

N2  - The societal distrust of public health alongside the complex, intersecting, and large public health crises of today and our future requires a transformation of the education of the next generation of public health leaders. The field of public health’s goals of health equity for all cannot be advanced until our field interrogates and resists the prison industrial complex (PIC), which maintains White supremacy and (re)produces health inequities. As current and former public health students, we propose incorporating abolition of the PIC as a political vision, structural and power analysis, and organizing strategy into the public health curriculum. We highlight gaps in the public health curriculum and the existing similarities between stated goals of abolition and public health. We propose calls to action for individuals, faculty, and schools of public health to interrogate the carceral nature of public health and work toward contributing to the positive project of an abolitionist future.

N2  - Background
Although it is clear that incarcerated women need access to effective therapies for trauma sequelae, some have argued that one of the most effective treatments – exposure therapy – should not be provided in carceral settings due to the presumed lack of safety and stability making such an intervention inappropriate. Group therapy, the typical mode of intervention in prisons, has also been presumed to be unacceptable for exposure-based processing due to assumptions that hearing others’ trauma narratives would be traumatizing and unhelpful to listeners. However, there is a lack of data to support either of the aforementioned assumptions. This study examined the acceptability of an exposure-based group therapy for women survivors of sexual violence who were currently incarcerated (
N
 = 61) by asking women themselves about their experiences completing an exposure-based group therapy protocol (SHARE;
S
urvivors
H
ealing from

buse:
R

) while incarcerated. We assessed women’s reasons for enrolling in the group, satisfaction with various therapy components (e.g., exposure, skill-building) and the treatment overall, and experiences of both sharing and listening to trauma narratives using a feedback survey that included a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. Treatment dropout was examined as an additional index of acceptability.
Results
Treatment completion was very high (88.8%). Nearly all women who completed the group reported that they would recommend it to other incarcerated women (96.7%, with the remaining 3.3% reporting “it depends”). Qualitative results revealed overwhelmingly positive feedback about the effect of the group and indicated that sharing and listening to trauma narratives in a group setting serve discrete but dually important functions. Specifically, women almost universally experienced listening to others’ trauma narratives (i.e., exposures) in the SHARE group context as helpful—making them feel less alone and normalizing their experiences. Sharing one’s own story primarily provided an emotional release and/or transformation (i.e., an intrapersonal rather than interpersonal function).
Conclusions
Our findings challenge common concerns about the appropriateness of 1) prison as a context for trauma-focused treatments, including exposure and 2) sharing trauma narratives in a group setting. Unless empirical evidence demonstrating harm is uncovered, best practices for PTSD and other trauma-related sequelae—those recommended in reputable treatment guidelines and interventions like SHARE that incorporate components shown to be effective (e.g., cognitive challenging, exposure)—should be offered to incarcerated women as part of standard of care.

N2  - Despite overall societal progress in reducing adverse impacts of heat and cold, incarcerated populations remain highly vulnerable to environmental stressors. Incarcerated populations experience a combination of risk factors related to their physical health and well-being that increase their thermal vulnerability: social isolation, disproportionate mental health issues, comorbidities, limited mobility, and a reliance on external factors to provide a safe, healthy environment. In carceral spaces, thermal exposure agitates these already complex situations, shaping a confluence of various economic, political, and ecological intersectionalities. This synthesis contextualizes the ongoing scholarship on climate change, thermal exposure, the built environment, and public policy, to examine thermal inequities experienced by incarcerated populations. In examining this context, we connect our work to carceral geographies, the geographies of violence, racial capitalism, and abolition ecologies. Ultimately, the review highlights how physical geographers may directly converse with critical geographers, promote equity and environmental justice, and work to reduce adverse impacts of extreme temperature events.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the demographic, legal, and clinical characteristics of a cross-section of incarcerated homeless individuals with the highest utilization of Los Angeles (LA) County public services in order to increase opportunities for focused jail diversion.
Methods: The "5% list" (N=5,905 in February 2018), LA County's list of homeless individuals with the highest 5% utilization of public services, was cross-matched with the total jail population to obtain a sample of 333 homeless high-utilizing individuals. This sample was compared with the overall jail population (N=17,121) from publicly available aggregate data by Chi-square testing.
Results: 84% of the high-utilizing sample were male, 38% Black, 37% Hispanic, 21% White. 67% were prescribed psychiatric medication. Compared with the overall jail population, the sample was significantly older, with a greater proportion of Black and White persons, and a lesser proportion of Hispanic individuals relative to the overall jail population. A significantly greater propmtion of high-utilizing individuals faced misdemeanor charges.
Conclusions: These data highlight the compounding effects of homelessness, race, and mental illness on carceral and social vulnerability. Findings suggest homeless high utilizers in jail with mental illness are likely to benefit from court-based diversion efforts aimed at housing and treatment.

N2  - Background Law enforcement officers (LEOs) come into frequent contact with people who inject drugs (PWID). Through service referrals, LEOs may facilitate PWID engagement in harm reduction, substance use treatment, and other health and supportive services. Little is known about PWID and LEO attitudes and concerns about service referrals, however. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to examine the alignment of service referral preferences and acceptability among PWID and LEOs in Tijuana, Mexico. Methods We assessed service referral preferences and perceived likelihood of participation in health and social services, integrating data from structured questionnaires with 280 PWID and 306 LEOs, contextualized by semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 15 PWID and 17 LEOs enrolled in two parallel longitudinal cohorts in Tijuana, Mexico. Results Among potential service referral options, both PWID (78%) and LEOs (88%) most frequently cited assistance with drug- and alcohol-use disorders. Over half of PWID and LEOs supported including harm reduction services such as syringe service programs, overdose prevention, and HIV testing. The majority of PWID supported LEO referrals to programs that addressed basic structural needs (e.g. personal care [62%], food assistance [61%], housing assistance [58%]). However, the proportion of LEOs (30-45%) who endorsed these service referrals was significantly lower (p < 0.01). Regarding referral acceptability, 71% of PWID reported they would be very likely or somewhat likely to make use of a referral compared to 94% of LEOs reporting that they thought PWID would always or sometimes utilize them. These results were echoed in the qualitative analysis, although practical barriers to referrals emerged, whereby PWID were less optimistic that they would utilize referrals compared to LEOs. Conclusions We identified strong support for LEO service referrals among both LEO and PWID respondents, with the highest preference for substance use treatment. LEO referral programs offer opportunities to deflect PWID contact with carceral systems while facilitating access to health and social services. However, appropriate investments and political will are needed to develop an evidence-based (integrated) service infrastructure.

N2  - Following significant social and legal challenges to Australia’s colonial policy of ‘offshoring’ immigration detention, the system has become more mobile and diffuse, expanding through a range of new, ad-hoc, and established detention sites both ‘on’ and ‘offshore’. Refugees, asylum seekers and other non-citizens are frequently transferred and dispersed between these sites, which form ‘spaces of disappearance’. In this article, we draw upon concepts of racial surveillance capitalism and data justice to analyse a work by the Manus Recording Project Collective, titled where are you today, that sought to expose and counter the colonial border’s disappearing effects. The work involved the creation and distribution of audio-recordings from inside detention sites to subscribers. Recordings were distributed via text messages that also plotted individual subscribers in spatiotemporal relation to the detained artists that created them. The Collective thereby appropriated the tools of surveillance capitalism – such as GPS tracking and timestamping – to create dynamic digital cartographies of the mobile-carceral border. Through studying this work, we aim to deepen understandings of colonial bordering practices and highlight possibilities for disrupting the social divisions and exclusions that they reproduce.

N2  - Purpose>Many heritage-listed gaols in Australia have become obsolete in terms of their original function and were decommissioned decades ago. As a default management practice, decommissioned gaols are usually transformed into museums which are mostly empty and underused without considering other viable alternatives. This research challenges this mainstream thinking and demonstrates that among the entire stock of heritage-listed gaols in Australia, even the least ranked gaol in terms of its potential for reuse can be turned into a thriving and vibrant new function.Design/methodology/approach>Hypothetically, if the least ranked Australian heritage-listed gaol in terms of its potential for reuse is in fact “reusable”, then the remaining heritage gaols have more chance of being successfully reused to accommodate a vibrant new function. To be able to test this hypothesis, first, the Adaptive Reuse Potential (ARP) model is applied to rank Australia's decommissioned heritage gaols which are spatially and structurally sound to accommodate new uses. Second, an architectural design concept was designed to adaptively reuse the lowest scored gaol (Richmond Gaol) to a boutique hotel. The conceptual design proposal was then assessed by three local heritage architecture firms to validate its applicability and viability.Findings>The research showed that Richmond Gaol can be reused successfully to at least one function, and accordingly, the whole stock of heritage gaols can be expected to also be reused to more sustainable purposes. The research identifies several considerations for the reuse of heritage gaols in Australia: the careful intervention to their significant fabric; maintaining sufficient evidence of the gaol's original components, the importance of the new use being compatible to the gaol's morphology to ensure minimum alterations or demolitions in the significant fabric of the site; and evaluating the new use and its components to achieve financial viability.Research limitations/implications>Due to the continuing closure of Tasmania's state borders amid the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the researchers were not able to travel to Tasmania to conduct a site visit and to run the in-depth interviews with the architects in person. Most of the data of the current status of the site, its current layout, museum elements, historical data and photos were provided by Heritage Authorities in Tasmania and the Tasmanian State Library and Archive Service. Supplementary information and photos were acquired in March 2020 from visitors of the gaol who uploaded their trip images to Google maps or to their travel blogs. Topographical data of the site was gathered from Topographic Base-map of Land Information System Richmond Tasmania (2020). Due to travel restrictions, in-depth interviews with the local architects were done virtually, or over the phone in one case.Practical implications>Challenges discussed in this research encourage creating nationally designed support programs to better vitalise and help preserve Australia's carceral heritage.Originality/value>This research utilises architectural design in an empirical research paradigm.

N2  - Institution-level wastewater-based surveillance was implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, including in carceral facilities. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 diagnostic test results of residents in a jail in Atlanta, Georgia, USA (average population approximate to 2,700), and quantitative reverse transcription PCR signal for SARS-CoV-2 in weekly wastewater samples collected during October 2021-May 2022. The jail offered residents rapid antigen testing at entry and periodic mass screenings by reverse transcription PCR of self-collected nasal swab specimens. We aggregated individual test data, calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient, and performed logistic regression to examine the relationship between strength of SARS-CoV-2 PCR signal (cycle threshold value) in wastewater and percentage of jail population that tested positive for COVID-19. Of 13,745 nasal specimens collected, 3.9% were COVID-positive (range 0%-29.5% per week). We obstrategy for jailwide surveillance of COVID-19.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is curable, but incarcerated populations face barriers to treatment. In a cohort of incarcerated hospitalized patients in Boston, Massachusetts, HCV infection was associated with increased mortality. Access to HCV treatment in carceral settings is crucial to avoid unnecessary death and to support HCV elimination efforts.

N2  - ‘Border hotels’ have come to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as spaces of detention and quarantine. Despite the longer history of using hotels for immigrant detention, efforts to contain outbreaks have led to the proliferation of hotels used for border governance. Ad hoc quarantine facilities have been set up around the world acting as choke points for mobility. The use of hotels as sites of detention has also gained significant attention, with pandemic related restrictions impacting on access to services for detained refugees and asylum seekers. Inhumane conditions and mobilisations against these conditions have recently received substantial media coverage. This symposium initiates a discussion about ‘border hotels’, closely engaging with these developments. Contributors document the shifting infrastructures of the border, and explore how these sites are experienced and resisted. They draw attention to divergent experiences of immobility, belonging, exclusion, and intersections of detention and quarantine. In exploring different - and controversial - aspects of ‘border hotels’, this symposium theorises modalities of governance implemented through hotels. Following in the footsteps of the ‘hotel geopolitics’ agenda (Fregonese and Ramadan 2015) it illustrates how hotels become integrated into border regimes. In doing so, it contributes to debates on the material and infrastructural dimensions of bordering practices and specifically to the literature on carceral geographies, polymorphic bordering and the politics of mobility.

N2  - Since the emergence of Somali piracy as a threat to the circulation of cargo and capital through the Gulf of Aden, we have seen a massive effort on the part of global institutions, states, militaries, and private sector actors to protect this major artery of global commerce. This paper offers an analysis of the new institutional patchwork of ‘counterpiracy’ through the lens of the production of security space. What comes into focus then are the historical and contemporary processes of securing the conditions of capital circulation through war, law, primitive accumulation, and the enclosure of maritime spaces. By bringing together Foucault’s analysis of security and Marx’s analysis of capital circulation under the rubric of the production of space, I put forth a theory of production of security space as forming part of an infrastructure of circulation. Ultimately, I argue that legal, carceral, bureaucratic, and military practices are constitutive of this process of spatial production. Under the rubric of counterpiracy, law and discipline (as Foucault once wrote) have become ‘armatures’ in the apparatus of security. They have also become cornerstones of the new infrastructure of global capital circulation.

N2  - This conversation features interdisciplinary scholars Kristopher Alexander, Negin Dahya, and TreaAndrea Russworm. Russworm outlines her work with “Radical Play,” a “civic and community engagement program” that she developed for high school students. Dahya describes a study that saw her working with youth in juvenile rehabilitation in order to co-design concept art for a virtual reality (VR) program. Her team’s research, Dahya explains, was influenced by carceral logic, the role of VR technology, and the institutional regulations that govern research and collaboration with young people. Alexander invites us to consider the pedagogical potential of games and digital technology when teaching and learning with students of all ages. The discussion that follows explores the relationship between academic disciplines, institutional barriers, and video game studies; the ethics and challenges of participatory research with youth; and the stakes of “gamifying” difficult topics including slavery, colonialism, and genocide.

N2  - This essay explores the everyday experience of time within the frame of captivity. Through a series of photographs jointly produced by the incarcerated men at Rapa Nui’s carceral facility—the so-called happiest prison in the world—and me, I describe how the quotidian constraints of a captured present are themselves eventful and how this can critically compromise one’s continuity in time. From the reflections of the imprisoned persons on the link between photographs and the narration of time, the photo essay argues that the photographs, as bodies beyond images, can act as perspectival hinges in which an encounter may occur, making the narration of time an affective possibility where experience can be held in common. Finally, it concludes by highlighting how time, just as it can be managed, bent, and distorted, can also go completely out of control, compromising the present in unforeseeable and sometimes devastating ways that bring forth the centrality of the unevenness of time in an unequal world.

N2  - Most incarcerated women in Canada are mothers. Because women are the fastest growing population in carceral facilities, protecting the rights of incarcerated women to breastfeed their children is increasingly important. There is considerable evidence that incarcerated women in Canada experience poor physical and mental health, isolation, and barriers to care. Incarcerated women and their children could benefit significantly from breastfeeding. This Insight in Policy explores policy and legal protection for breastfeeding in Canada as it relates to carceral facilities, considers key cases regarding breastfeeding rights among incarcerated women, and presents recommendations for policy development and advocacy. The Canadian Constitution and human rights legislation across Canada prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender and includes pregnancy and the possibility of becoming pregnant as a characteristic of gender. Some provinces note that breastfeeding is a characteristic of gender. Women’s Wellness Within, a nonprofit organization providing volunteer perinatal support to criminalized women in Nova Scotia, conducted a scan of all provincial and territorial correctional services acts and the federal Corrections and Conditional Release Act: none mention breastfeeding. Protocols for breastfeeding during arrest and lockup by police were not available in any jurisdiction across Canada. International law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Nelson Mandela Rules, and the Bangkok Rules, have application to the rights of incarcerated breastfeeding women. The Inglis v. British Columbia (Minister of Public Safety) (2013) and Hidalgo v. New Mexico Department of Corrections (2017) decisions are pivotal examples of successful litigation brought forward by incarcerated mothers to advance breastfeeding rights. Improved application and understanding of existent law could advance breastfeeding rights.

N2  - Three widely discussed explanations of the punitive carceral state are racism, harsh drug laws, and prosecutorial overreach. These three narratives, however, only partially explain how our correctional system expanded to its current overcrowded state. Neglected in our discussion of mass incarceration is our largely forgotten history of the long-term, wholesale institutionalization of the disabled. This form of mass detention, motivated by a continuing application of eugenics and persistent class-based discrimination, is an important part of our history of imprisonment, one that has shaped key contours of our current supersized correctional system. Only by fully exploring this forgotten narrative of long-term detention and isolation will policy makers be able to understand, diagnose, and solve the crisis of mass incarceration.

N2  - This paper begins by examining recent scholarship on the carceral state and its political consequences as an opportunity to reassess the study of urban politics. Along with illuminating how race structures local power relations, research on the carceral state exposes gaps in the long-standing, political–economy paradigm, and in particular regime theory, concerning the political lives of ordinary people and the role of ideas, values, and ideology in shaping political behavior. At the same time, this paper recognizes the powerful impact of market forces on urban governance, as well as regime theory’s emphasis on organizational resources, intergroup collaboration, and coalition building in accounting for business influence over city policymaking. A new analytical approach is proposed—the mobilization–governance framework—that seeks to build on the insights of scholarship on the carceral state while retaining still-valuable aspects of regime theory. A case study of contemporary politics in Philadelphia is presented to illustrate how the mobilization–governance framework might be applied.

N2  - Decarceration policies, enacted for SARS-CoV-2 mitigation in carceral settings, potentially exacerbated barriers to care for people living with HIV (PWH) with criminal legal involvement (CLI) during Shelter-in-Place (SIP) by limiting opportunities for engagement in provisions of HIV and behavioral health care. We compared health care engagement for PWH with CLI in San Francisco, California before and after decarceration and SIP using interrupted time series analyses. Administrative data identified PWH booked at the San Francisco County Jail with at least one clinic encounter from 01/01/2018-03/31/2020 within the municipal health care network. Monthly proportions of HIV, substance use, psychiatric and acute care encounters before (05/01/2019-02/29/2020) and after (03/01/2020-12/31/2020) SIP and decarceration were compared using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) log-binomial and logistic regression models, clustering on the patient-level. Of 436 patients, mean age was 43 years (standard-deviation 11); 88% cisgender-male; 39% white, 66% homeless; 67% had trimorbidity by Elixhauser score (medical comorbidity, psychotic disorder or depression, and substance use disorder). Clinical encounters immediately dropped following SIP for HIV (aOR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.90) and substance use visits (aRR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99) and declined in subsequent months. Differential reductions in clinical encounters were seen among Black/African Americans (aRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99) and people experiencing homelessness (aRR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.98). Significant reductions in care were observed for PWH with CLI during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among Black/African Americans and people experiencing homelessness. Strategies to End the HIV Epidemic must improve engagement across diverse care settings to improve outcomes for this key population.

N2  - In this article, I explore how mobility, animacy, and ontology intertwine to shape everyday violence in the carceral American Southwest. I draw on ethnographic research that I conducted between 2016 and 2017 at the Desert Echo Facility, a state prison that holds individuals from minimum to high-security levels. Some incarcerated people feel supposedly inanimate objects, such as walls, rocks, paper, and floors moving, while others feel vibrations moving across the compound. For some of the incarcerated, physical movement signifies aliveness - meaning that incarceration forces them to question if they are less alive than the "inanimate" materials that confine them. Others understand these movements as the direct violence of the state that purposefully disrupts how they construct relations. In this context, incarcerated peoples' alive status is no longer a given and their relations no longer assumed to be inherent and ongoing, but rather, processes to be negotiated within criminal punishment systems. I focus on what these movements mean to incarcerated people, and how they situate these movements within differing ontologies to make visible the often-hidden violence of incarceration in the United States.

N2  - Healthcare under the auspices of late‐stage capitalism is a total institution that mortifies nurses and patients alike, demanding conformity, obedience, perfection. This capture, which resembles Deleuze's enclosure, entangles nurses in carceral systems and gives way to a postenclosure society, an institution without walls. These societies of control constitute another sort of total institution, more covert and insidious for their invisibility (Deleuze, 1992). While Delezue (1992) named physical technologies like electronic identification badges as key to understanding these societies of control, the political economy of late‐stage capitalism functions as a total institution with no cohesive, centralized, connected material apparatus required. In this manuscript, we outline the ways in which the healthcare industrial complex demands nurse conformity and how that, in turn, operationalizes nurses in service to the institution. This foundation leads to the assertion that nursing must foster a radical imagination for itself, unbound by reality as it presently exists, in order that we might conjure more just, equitable futures for caregivers and care receivers alike. To tease out what a radical imagination might look like, we dwell in paradox: getting folks the care they need in capitalist healthcare systems; engaging nursing's deep history to inspire alternative understandings for the future of the discipline; and how nursing might divest from extractive institutional structures. This paper is a jumping‐off place to interrogate the ways institutions telescope and where nursing fits into the arrangement.

N2  - Carcerality in Transition: The Productive Relations of Reentry Governance in New Orleans is an ethnographic critique of contemporary carceral reform. Tracing the emergent infrastructure of prisoner reentry in New Orleans, Louisiana, this work interrogates the political economy and aspirational ethics of progressive city governance that reconfigure and are refracted through racializing techniques of punitive justice, capital investment and spatial regimes.While anthropologists and political theorists of governance have offered important critiques of the neoliberal city, they have not adequately attended to the processes of racialization that constitute the ethics of progressive governance. Drawing upon the scholarly repertoires of Black Studies, my dissertation intervenes upon conceptualizations of neoliberal urban governance by mobilizing theories and histories of racial capitalism and carceral geographies. Carcerality in Transition examines how the private/public infrastructures of reentry, from the experimental workforce development court to the nonprofits that provide professional training and transitional housing, impel certain social, material and ideological relations while foreclosing the potentials for others that could challenge neoliberal racial capitalism. Through this critique, I attend to the relational processes of racecraft and statecraft in the American City.This work explores the institutional and intimate socialites of formerly incarcerated men and their families, legal professionals, nonprofit operatives, city planners and municipal bureaucrats that differentially construct and participate within the emic landscape of the reentry space. I situate their life histories and experiences within the racialized histories of the city of New Orleans, from slavery and plantation economies to the more recent histories of urban divestment, post-Katrina devastation and dispossession. In studying what I call “reformist New Orleans,” I argue that progressive innovations in carceral governance–characterized by a valorization of entrepreneurialism, design-thinking, data-driven best practices and technologies of care–ultimately defer racial justice while attempting to attend to racial inequality. Yet the vernacular practices of my interlocutors evade and exceed this framework to animate, even if only momentarily, a more radical distributive politics. Carcerality in Transition concludes by discussing the potentials for abolitionist futures.

N2  - Stemmed from zero-tolerance policies, Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs/Classrooms (DAEPs) in Texas are disciplinary spaces designed to house students deemed at risk, while schools continue to serve students’ educational needs of (Aron 2006, Tajalli & Garba, 2014). Once there, students are stereotyped with analogous carceral-framed personas that taint who they are, how they are perceived, and/or how they are treated in alternative classrooms (Dunning-Lozano, 2015; 2018). As a result, the programs/classrooms are fundamental bastions of the school-to-prison-nexus involving a culmination of practices, and policies, along with institutional enforcements that push youths from school to the legal system (Fernandez, Kirshner & Lewis, 2016; Hartnett, 2011). Situated on the U.S.-Mexico Borderland in a post-COVID era, in this study I explored the experiences of key enforcers in these disciplinary classrooms—teachers, administrators, and campus patrols. Utilizing phenomenology and semi-structured interviews (Harrell & Bradley, 2009), I explored their understanding of the dynamics of disciplining, student infractions, and disciplinary exclusion in DAEP classrooms. Data were analyzed through Foucault’s (1977) disciplinary technologies’ lens and Bourdieu’s (1977) symbolic violence where participants conceptualized how alternative classrooms or spaces are framed as carceral spaces within educational institutions (Dunning-Lozano, 2015). Further, I elaborated on how enforcers view alternative students, their infractions, and themselves. Lastly, I discuss the implications for further research.

N2  - La Révolution française était un tournant vers la culture et la morale républicaines. À la lumière des études sociohistoriques et des études de genre les historiens accordent une attention particulière à une nouvelle structure sociale et à l’activisme politique des femmes. Ils examinent des organisations politiques révolutionnaires, la conscience et l’expérience des femmes qui ont confronté la société dominée par les hommes. Cependant, leurs études sur l’univers carcéral négligent de soulever la question du genre. La prison a permis aux femmes non seulement de trouver le sens de leur existence, de revivre les événements passés, mais aussi d'établir une identité et de guider leur compétence politique derrière les barreaux.La littérature de prison du XVIIIèmesiècle est particulière, non seulement parce qu’elle est écrite par les femmes pour les femmes, mais parce que sa thématique se contraste et se place dans deux régimes politiques. En tant qu’héritage politique et intellectuel et en réponse à la marginalisation des sexes, elle fournit un cadre historique de la lutte des femmes pour leurs droits. Les écrits carcéraux qui manifestent la quête identitaire des prisonnières, dépassent les frontières politiques et sociales, spatiales et temporelles, en affirmant l’importance des femmes dans la construction d'une nouvelle nation et d'une nouvelle ère philosophique moderne.

N2  - The Bloomsbury Guide to Philosophy of Disability is a revolutionary collection encompassing the most innovative and insurgent work in philosophy of disability. Edited and anthologized by disabled philosopher Shelley Lynn Tremain, this book challenges how disability has historically been represented and understood in philosophy: it critically undermines the detrimental assumptions that various subfields of philosophy produce; resists the institutionalized ableism of academia to which these assumptions contribute; and boldly articulates new anti-ableist, anti-sexist, anti-racist, queer, anti-capitalist, anti-carceral, and decolonial insights and perspectives that counter these assumptions. This rebellious and groundbreaking book's chapters-most of which have been written by disabled philosophers-are wide-ranging in scope and invite a broad readership. The chapters underscore the eugenic impetus at the heart of bioethics; talk back to the whiteness of work on philosophy and disability with which philosophy of disability is often conflated; and elaborate phenomenological, poststructuralist, and materialist approaches to a variety of phenomena. Topics addressed in the book include: ableism and speciesism; disability, race, and algorithms; race, disability, and reproductive technologies; disability and music; disabled and trans identities and emotions; the apparatus of addiction; and disability, race, and risk. With cutting-edge analyses and engaging prose, the authors of this guide contest the assumptions of Western disability studies through the lens of African philosophy of disability and the developing framework of crip Filipino philosophy; articulate the political and conceptual limits of common constructions of inclusion and accessibility; and foreground the practices of epistemic injustice that neurominoritized people routinely confront in philosophy and society more broadly.A crucial guide to oppositional thinking from an international, intersectional, and inclusive collection of philosophers, this book will advance the emerging field of philosophy of disability and serve as an antidote to the historical exclusion of disabled philosophers from the discipline and profession of philosophy.The Bloomsbury Guide to Philosophy of Disability is essential reading for faculty and students in philosophy, disability studies, political theory, Africana studies, Latinx studies, women's and gender studies, LGBTQ studies, and cultural studies, as well as activists, cultural workers, policymakers, and everyone else concerned with matters of social justice.Description of the book's cover: The book's title appears on two lines across the top of the cover which is a salmon tone. The names of the editor and the author of the foreword appear in white letters at the bottom of the book. The publisher's name is printed along the right side in white letters. At the centre, a vertical white rectangle is the background for a sculpture by fibre artist Judith Scott. The sculpture combines layers of shiny yarn in various colours including orange, pink, brown, and rust woven vertically on a large cylinder and horizontally around a smaller cylinder, as well as blue yarn woven around a protruding piece at the bottom of the sculpture. The sculpture seems to represent a body and head of a being sitting down, a being with one appendage, a fat person, or a little person.

N2  - Black Americans are arrested at disproportionate levels compared with White Americans. We sought to understand whether the association between psychopathology and arrest record is equally strong for Black Americans and White Americans, hypothesizing that the association would be stronger for Black Americans. In a sample of adults (age: M = 34.81 years), we found that at the same level of psychopathology severity, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity, Black Americans (n = 585) exhibited higher rates of being arrested in adulthood than White Americans (n = 977). These findings held even when controlling for environmental (e.g., socioeconomic status) and individual (e.g., substance-use history) factors associated with arrests. This suggests that the risk conferred by more severe psychopathology on arrests is stronger for Black Americans than White Americans. Our results highlight how structural racism affects both psychopathology and the carceral system to contribute to the overrepresentation of Black Americans within the criminal justice system.

N2  - Background Police constitute a structural determinant of health and HIV risk of people who inject drugs (PWID), and negative encounters with law enforcement present significant barriers to PWID access to harm reduction services. Conversely, police may facilitate access via officer-led referrals, potentiating prevention of HIV, overdose, and drug-related harms. We aimed to identify police characteristics associated with support for officer-led referrals to addiction treatment services and syringe service programs (SSP). We hypothesized that officers who believe harm reduction services are contradictory to policing priorities in terms of safety and crime reduction will be less likely to support police referrals. Methods Between January and June 2018, police officers (n = 305) in Tijuana, Mexico, completed self-administered surveys about referrals to harm reduction services during the 24-month follow-up visit as part of the SHIELD police training and longitudinal cohort study. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios and model policing characteristics and attitudes related to officers' support for including addiction treatment and SSP in referrals. Results Respondents were primarily male (89%), patrol officers (86%) with a median age of 38 years (IQR 33-43). Overall, 89% endorsed referral to addiction services, whereas 53% endorsed SSP as acceptable targets of referrals. Officers endorsing addiction services were less likely to be assigned to high drug use districts (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] = 0.50, 95% CI 0.24, 1.08) and more likely to agree that methadone programs reduce crime (APR = 4.66, 95% CI 2.05, 9.18) than officers who did not support addiction services. Officers endorsing SSPs were younger (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR] = 0.96 95% CI 0.93, 0.98), less likely to be assigned to high drug use districts (APR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29, 0.87), more likely to believe that methadone programs reduce crime (APR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.30, 4.55), and less likely to believe that SSPs increase risk of needlestick injury for police (APR = 0.44, 0.27, 0.71). Conclusions Beliefs related to the occupational impact of harm reduction services in terms of officer safety and crime reduction are associated with support for referral to related harm reduction services. Efforts to deflect PWID from carceral systems toward harm reduction by frontline police should include measures to improve officer knowledge and attitudes about harm reduction services as they relate to occupational safety and law enforcement priorities.

N2  - In Virtual Pedophilia Gillian Harkins traces how by the end of the twentieth century the pedophile as a social outcast evolved into its contemporary appearance as a virtually normal white male. The pedophile's alleged racial and gender normativity was treated as an exception to dominant racialized modes of criminal or diagnostic profiling. The pedophile was instead profiled as a virtual figure, a potential threat made visible only when information was transformed into predictive image. The virtual pedophile was everywhere and nowhere, slipping through day-to-day life undetected until people learned how to arm themselves with the right combination of visually predictive information. Drawing on television, movies, and documentaries such as Law and Order: SVU, To Catch a Predator, Mystic River, and Capturing the Friedmans, Harkins shows how diverse U.S. audiences have been conscripted and trained to be lay detectives who should always be on the lookout for the pedophile as virtual predator. In this way, the perceived threat of the pedophile legitimated increased surveillance and ramped-up legal strictures that expanded the security apparatus of the carceral state.

N2  - Harris reports on the research that disproportionate death rates were reported in US Prisons early before the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 was a principal driver behind a 77% higher mortality rate in 2020 than in 2019 among people incarcerated in US prisons, according to data from 48 Departments of Corrections. The researchers noted that increased mortality among the general population was much lower early in the pandemic-23% between 2020 and 2021. Mortality rates in US prisons were higher among all age groups in 2020 than in 2019, with people aged 50 years or older experiencing the largest increases in death rates. Although Covid-19 accounted for the majority of increased deaths from natural causes, prisons in several states, including Georgia and Tennessee, also had increases in deaths from unnatural causes such as drug overdoses, suicide, and homicide. Policies for prison staff concerning universal testing and vaccine mandates as well as more transparent data about deaths in carceral facilities are desperately needed to improve care for those in prisons.

N2  - The bodies of low‐income Chicana‐Indigenous women are often sites of chronic racialized and gendered stress, as well as tremendous potentiality. I examine the relationship between stress and possibility as shaped by Chicana‐Indigenous spiritual healing among members of a women's healing collective in California. These women articulate chronic stresses as cargas, Spanish for burden, baggage, or charge. Unloading these stresses among each other, or descargando, leads to actions mobilized as anticarceral activism. Attention to their sense of stress carried collectively as cargas builds on Black feminist understandings of stress as structured by racialized criminalization and state and carceral violence while illuminating the materiality and potentiality of this embodiment in Chicana‐Indigenous contexts. The strategies cultivated for healing in these conditions underscore that stress is a worldly phenomenon, requiring emergent coalitions addressing social and structural conditions rather than solely individual therapeutic remedy or resilience. Working from feminist and fugitive anthropological commitments, centering descargando as an embodied knowledge praxis, I argue that an anthropological concern with potentiality must have an active, liberatory ethics, rooted in intersectional solidarity, accountability, and care.

N2  - Research examining the well-being of correctional officers (COs) has primarily focused on their exposure to potentially psychologically traumatic events (PPTE) and the presence of mental health disorders once employed. Absent is an understanding of the mental health of COs and their exposures to PPTEs before entering the federal CO occupation. In the current article, we qualitatively examine how themes of resilience and posttraumatic growth emerge in correctional officer recruit narratives of overcoming their past experiences with PPTE exposures. Drawing from interview data, we analyzed the descriptions of PPTEs from 100 correctional officer recruits, focusing on experiences of coping with PPTEs and shedding light on their descriptions of resiliency and posttraumatic growth. Of our 100 participants, 86 reported prior exposure to a PPTE. Analyses of semistructured interviews reveal engagement in processes such as distancing, relationality, and vulnerability. We discuss how such processes may serve as strategies for resilience that can help COs, who work in carceral environments, cope with PPTEs and maintain or regain well-being.

N2  - While infectious diseases (ID) are a well-documented public health issue in carceral settings, research on ID screening and treatment in jails is lacking. A survey was sent to 1,126 jails in the United States to identify the prevalence of health screenings at intake and characteristics of care for ID; 371 surveys were completed correctly and analyzed. Despite conflicting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, only seven percent of surveyed jails test individuals for HIV at admission. In 46% of jails, non-healthcare personnel perform ID screenings. Jails in less urban areas were more likely to report healthcare screenings performed by correctional officers. Survey findings indicate that HIV, HCV and TB testing during jail admissions and access to PrEP are severely lacking in less urban jails in particular. Recommendations are provided to improve ID surveillance and address the burden of ID in correctional facilities.

N2  - This article is an ethnographic account of an archive of prison letters written by three generations of female kin. Based on long-term ethnographic research in rural New Mexico, it describes the context in which the letters were written, as well as the desires, preoccupations, and practices that transformed them into an archive. I have placed a particular focus on how dislocation and connection manifest in the letters and shape the kinds of narratives the archive tells. Themes of isolation, loss, and memory are explored within the wider context of colonial history and the acceleration of the carceral state. This article seeks to integrate these registers analytically, while elucidating the role of archiving for a subject’s present life.

N2  - Background
The role of rapid testing has proven vital in reducing infection incidence in communities through swift identification and isolation of infected individuals. The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly catastrophic for residential carceral and rehabilitation facilities that are high-risk settings for transmission of contagious diseases. Centralized provider-based viral testing employing conventional diagnostic techniques is labor-intensive and time-consuming. There is a marked unmet need for quick, inexpensive, and simple viral testing strategies. We hypothesized that rehabilitation residents could successfully test themselves employing inexpensive, disposable, antigen-based influenza lateral-flow tests and would be willing to self-isolate and self-report to health authorities if positive.
Methods
We evaluated self-testing among 50 rehabilitation residents ages 18 and older in Pomona, California, where participants self-administered influenza lateral-flow diagnostic test (without specimen collection) with the goal of appropriately observing a control line and completed two brief written surveys on self-testing and COVID-19, one before self-administering the lateral-flow test and one after, to determine the overall feasibility of viral self-testing and to characterize attitudes comparing self-testing and provider-based testing.
Findings
A total of 50 rehabilitation residents were enrolled in this study and all 50 conducted a lateral-flow test and answered the provided surveys. Among the participants, 96% (48 of 50) achieved a positive-control line from their lateral-flow test. Most participants, 83% (34 of 41) indicated that they would prefer to perform their own rapid test instead of having a health care provider administer the test. Notably, 98% (49 of 50) indicated that they would self-isolate if the lateral-flow test returned a positive indicator suggesting the presence of a viral infection and 96% (48 of 50) would report positive results to their corresponding public health department.
Interpretation
Residents in a residential rehabilitation center were widely able to successfully self-administer standard lateral-flow antigen-based rapid diagnostic kits. Self-testing was strongly preferred over tests administered by a healthcare provider. Reassuringly, almost every resident indicated that they would report any positive test result to the health department and self-isolate accordingly. Self-testing offers a promising adjunct to centralized testing, potentially better enabling swift and effective management of life-threatening infectious outbreaks among those living in high-risk congregate living settings.

N2  - Risk assessments in carceral settings have proliferated in recent decades and are now prominent in numerous states and regions. A ubiquitous variety is actuarial risk assessment instruments that are used on children and adults to predict their future chance for misconduct (e.g., recidivism) in several vital decision points in carceral processing (e.g., pretrial confinement). These instruments rely on information about past behavior (e.g., criminal history) and an understanding of offending (e.g., antisocial personality) that is thought to be neutral, reliable, and enjoys predictive validity. However, it will be argued that when justice system personnel assess the chance of unwanted behavior in the future, several risk domains are differentially prevalent and more frequently experienced by some groups. Much of this disparity is caused by, or due to, forces external to those being assessed, for instance, inequitable social and economic conditions and inequitable decisions by justice personnel to arrest, charge, or sentence people of color. As such, risk assessment instruments inevitably and disproportionately mark some groups of people as a higher risk to violate rules, conditions, orders, or laws. Consequently, risk assessment instruments systematically disfavor disadvantage, and by inference, favor advantage, leading to the need for a radical shift in the taxonomy of classifying risk for future misconduct.

N2  - Most individuals that enter the carceral system have substance use disorder. Because one state still has the full SNAP ban and many others have modified bans, these bans-which are not enacted for other felonies or health conditions-increase the barriers to participation in SNAP among people with substance use disorder. Additionally, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals are more likely to be convicted of drug felonies than are their White counterparts, even when drug use is the same. · These bans make it difficult for people with felony drug convictions to participate in SNAP, which increases the risk of recidivism, food insecurity, and poor health outcomes in a population that experiences disproportionate levels of health disparities. İt is critical to conduct research to further assess the impacts ofthese bans on this population. Proponents of the SNAP ban may challenge amendments to these policies as they argue in favor of welfare reform, combating drug use, and promoting community safety. Because these bans have not been effective at reducing drug use or sales, focus should be on policies that help people convicted of drug felonies with gainful employment and services to become successful community members. Because of the numerous inadequacies in accessing determinants of health in this population, policies should focus on improving access instead of contributing to longer-term punishments that affect individuals, their families, and communities.

N2  - Incarceration harms health. Individuals released from carceral facilities have high rates of suicide, overdose, psychiatric hospitalization, and death.1 Yet, some of the most often cited literature on postrelease mortality precedes the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, both adding significant risk to the well-being of incarcerated individuals. Incarceration takes many different forms. Jails, typically operated by local municipalities, are short-term facilities with rapid turnover and short stays. In contrast, prisons are usually state-run, housing individuals with multiyear sentences. The variability of jails and prisons makes comparing health outcomes challenging; a state-run prison in Washington is very different than a jail in New York City. Even within one state, aggregated data are often unavailable as county- and state-run facilities do not share or make available their data.

N2  - Abstract
This paper suggests studies on genetically engineering nonhuman animal genes have globalized over the last 30 years. The results unveil maps that give a global overview of universities' studies into engineering animal genes, by purpose and by species, at a state scale. A network map also shows how studies on engineering animal genes are co-constituted internationally, at a state scale. Some of the more notable map findings are developed using a novel ontological approach. This ontology relates the being of an animal, a constitutive lack, to power relations. The beings of animals are trapped into serving capital through the engineering of their genes. This reconfiguration allows the ensnaring of the body in agricultural, or other, power relations. The scale of this carceral archipelago is positioned as a global risk. Life energy, by nature, resists capture. Therefore, the paper concludes that the clock is ticking on genetic scientists' Faustian bargain.

Looking specifically at Islamic marriage and business partnerships forged between persecuted Uyghurs and their Uzbek partners, it argues that commodity‐mediated forms of transnational intimacy create spaces of safety and possibility in the face of political oppression, carceral violence, and gendered limitations. These transnational mobilities are forged in spite of structural immobilities. Taking seriously the imbrications of objects and people, it advances a view of intimacy as a multi‐scalar, trans‐subjective, and multiply entangled field of relationality.

N2  - This essay traces a rural network of modern carceral and internal colonial land enclosures developed in late nineteenth-century Germany. It considers the extent to which long-running debates over the value of penal colonialism and deportation for the management of societal 'threats' influenced shifts in carceral policy of the time, long thought to have been largely determined by the welfare reform movement of the Wilhelmine period and the notion of 'protective supervision' that prevailed in its wake. It is argued that certain aspects of convict colonialism, publicly interrogated by German legal theorists, were quietly adapted by carceral reform practices beginning in the 1880s. This essay speculates on the spatial and territorial implications of those adaptations, examining the little-known prison labour camps located in the sewage farms of Berlin after 1890, the model establishment of the rural labour colony founded by the pastor Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, and the Prussian Settlement Commission's anti-Slavic, anti-migrant program of internal colonisation, established by the German Ministry of Agriculture in 1886. It is argued that links between them were crystallised in a racialised topos of waste, framed by an emergent environmental discourse that served to sediment difference. Together, these institutions of correction, the architectures of enclosure that attended them, and the segregated geographies that resulted from them transformed the meaning and administration of Germany's rural landscape and demarcate modern imperial planning practices that mobilised space, territory, and environment as mediums of 'progressive' reform and 'protective supervision' tied to increasingly regimented and policed forms of settlement.

N2  - To date, studies of imprisonment and incarceration have focused on the growth of male-gendered penal institutions. This essay offers a provocative addition to the global study of the prison by tracing the emergence of a carceral system in West Africa in the nineteenth century that was organized around the female body. By examining archival testimonies of female prisoners held in what were called “native prisons” in colonial Gold Coast (southern Ghana), this essay shows how birthing, impregnation, and menstruation shaped West Africa penal practices, including the selection of the captives, the duration of their time in prison, and how the prison factored into the legal infrastructure around tort settlements for debts and crimes. The term “prison of the womb” is used here to describe how the West African prison held bloodlines captive, threatening the impregnation of a female kin member as a ticking clock for tort settlement. Furthermore, it will be shown that this institution was imperative to the spread of mercantile capitalism in nineteenth-century Gold Coast.

N2  - Adult environmental education and training programs (environmental programs) are used to promote environmental stewardship in the United States (US). One unique setting for these programs is US prisons. Prison-based environmental programs vary widely, from Cooperative Extension Service programs (e.g. Master Gardener programs) to STEM lecture series to environmental literacy and job training programs to conservation research programs. Scholars have examined how these programs impact people who are incarcerated, but there is little research on how these programs affect the programs' non-incarcerated facilitators (e.g. program administrators, educators, scientists, etc.). In this exploratory study, we use semi-structured, in-depth interviews to examine the experiences of some individuals engaged in implementing prison-based environmental programs. Our findings show how participants' efforts to "transform" people who are incarcerated led many of them to their own transformations in how they perceived (1) people who are incarcerated, (2) their environmental programs, and (3) the broader carceral system.

N2  - Pervasive carceral conditions are being met with a range of efforts to make what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls "freedom as a place." What does it mean to create such places? We answer here by taking seriously the methodological demands of how we do abolition work in the academy. Abolition methodologies entail a responsibility to bridge the spaces between academic and community work focused on resisting and building alternatives to carcerality. Taking our lead from organizers embedded in communities of practice and care, we see abolition methodologies as an opportunity to pursue a range of artistic, educational, and politically strategic scholar and scholar-activist works. Inspired by Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang's understanding that refusals can offer imaginative alternatives, we present four principles of abolitionist methodologies grounded in generative acts of refusal. These include abolition as reorientation, as contextual, as livingness, and as relational. To illustrate these principles in action, we discuss our efforts in the Prison Agriculture Lab to develop creative works and beneficial tools that, we hope, will help upend racial capitalism and advance the practice of abolition in daily life.

N2  - This paper examines a 'landscape of power' in the marginal northeastern corner of Italy, near the Italian-Slovenian border. The landscape is centred around the small town of Gradisca and its highly contested centres for asylum seekers and marked by the concomitant presence of a giant shopping mall, the largest Italian war memorial, and an aestheticised wine district. The result of participant observation, visual and textual analysis, and selected interviews, this study reflects on the transformation of a former cold war border area into a mix of carceral, hospitality, commercial, residential, rural spatialities that seem to be entirely disconnected with each other and linked instead to broader regional, national and international geographies. This fragmented landscape, dominated by massive 'fortified' enclosures and with gradually deterritorialised in-between spaces, described here as no man's land, may be provocatively analysed as an Italian exopolis.

N2  - Individuals living in carceral systems oftentimes are not prioritized in ways that ensure that their rights and dignity are protected. Many families and communities have been and continue to be separated and negatively impacted by disparities in judges’ sentencing practices resulting in inequities in treatment and outcomes. As we continue our series on learning the language of health equity, we elucidate health inequities for justices-involved individuals in correctional facilities. This paper contributes to systematically identifying the role of nurse researchers in eliminating health inequities for adults living in correctional health settings to improve health outcomes. It is our determined belief that only through heightening the awareness of nurses on workforce and public biases about people living in prison and their deservedness of compassionate care; advocating for the elimination of stigmatizing and dehumanizing care practices that are regularly levied on them across settings; and including them in health-related research, that we can achieve health equity for this population.

N2  - The present study evaluates eight mental health jail interventions (MHJIs) across Michigan that were developed to reduce jail populations through services including advocacy for early jail release, in-jail mental health treatment services, discharge planning and referral, and discharge planning follow-up. Current study analysis uses multisource administrative data to assess mental health treatment and recidivism outcomes among participants following their release from jail. A total of 1,183 individuals participated in eight MHJIs. The present study evaluated efficacy of the MHJIs utilizing three postrelease outcome variables: continuity of care, treatment engagement, and recidivism. Findings show that MHJIs improved mental health treatment outcomes among participants but had limited impact on reducing recidivism. Participants who received a diversion intervention, experienced higher service dosage, and who successfully completed the MHJI had better mental health treatment outcomes following jail release. Additionally, analysis indicates that certain demographic, behavioral health, and criminal/legal background indicators were associated with better mental health treatment outcomes among participants. This study highlights MHJIs to address outcomes for people with mental health needs before, during, and after a jail stay, acknowledging that comprehensive mental health and substance misuse programming must extend beyond carceral facilities and address both treatment and other criminogenic risk factors.

N2  - BackgroundThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic exposed and exacerbated health disparities between socioeconomic groups. Our purpose was to determine if age, sex, race, insurance, and comorbidities predicted patients' length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the early pandemic.MethodsUtilizing retrospective, secondarily sourced electronic health record (EHR) data for patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from HCA Healthcare facilities, predictors of LOS and in-hospital mortality were assessed using regression. LOS and in-hospital mortality were assessed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression, respectively. All models included age, insurance status, and sex, while additional covariates were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. LOS data were presented as incidence rate ratios (IRR), and in-hospital mortality was presented as odds ratios (OR), followed by their 95% confidence intervals (CI).ResultsThere were 111,849 qualifying patient records from March 1, 2020, to August 23, 2020. After excluding those with missing data (n = 7), without clinically confirmed COVID-19 (n = 27,225), and those from a carceral environment (n = 1,861), there were 84,624 eligible patients. Compared to the population of the United States of America, our COVID-19 cohort had a larger proportion of African American patients (23.17% versus 13.4%). The African American patients were more likely to have private insurance providers (28.52% versus 23.68%) and shorter LOS (IRR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.86-0.90) than the White patient cohort. In addition, the African American versus White patients did not have increased odds (OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-1.00) of in-hospital mortality. Patients on Medicaid (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07) and self-pay (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.00-1.14, noninclusive endpoints) had higher in-hospital mortality than private insurance. Several comorbidities were predictive of an increased LOS, including anxiety (IRR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.87-2.01) and sedative abuse (IRR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.63-2.64).ConclusionsRace was not associated with increased LOS or in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infections during the early pandemic. Insurance type, psychiatric comorbidities, and medical comorbidities significantly impacted outcomes in patients with COVID-19. This research and future research in the field should help to determine rational public policies to help mitigate the risk of diseases and their impact on future pandemics.

N2  - Using public housing developments as a strategic site, our research documents a distinct pathway linking disadvantaged context to incarceration—the public-housing-to-prison pipeline. Focusing on New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) housing developments as a case study, we find that incarceration rates in NYCHA tracts are 4.6 times higher than those in non-NYCHA tracts. More strikingly, 94% of NYCHA tracts report rates above the median value for non-NYCHA tracts. Moreover, 17% of New York State’s incarcerated population originated from just 372 NYCHA tracts. Compared with non-NYCHA tracts, NYCHA tracts had higher shares of Black residents and were significantly more disadvantaged. This NYCHA disadvantage in concentrated incarceration is also robust at different spatial scales. Our findings have implications for policies and programs to disrupt community-based pipelines to prison.

N2  - In recent years, journalists and researchers have used mixed methods to characterize a pattern of prison landscapes being exposed to environmental hazards such as air pollution, proximity to hazardous facilities, and inadequate mitigation in extreme weather—a pattern frequently referred to as “prison ecology.” However, no studies have sought to characterize the perceptions of organizers across U.S. cities who work at the intersection of prison and the environment, and the potential or limitations of data to support ongoing activities. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with organizers that work on issues related to prison and the environment to understand the tactics and challenges in prison ecology organizing, and opportunities or limitations of geospatial data and technology development to support desired outcomes. Results indicate that prison ecology organizers regularly engage data and mapping to support their campaigns and challenge the state's control over information. However, activists reported that some data tools are overly burdensome, insufficient, or difficult to master. They also report a desire for new and accessible data and mapping tools since there are numerous gaps in knowledge about prisons and environmental concerns. Finally, activists articulated specific changes that they would like to see in the U.S. carceral system as a result of mobilizing around the use of key data sources. Our findings advance the study of the data practices of community organizers by providing insight into how different mediums of data and digital tools are currently integrated into activism. This article also offers constructive reflections into how datafication, and specifically remote sensing (RS) technology, can further be brought to bear on prison ecology. This work can be useful to any scholar-activists aiming to develop RS for prison ecology organizing or environmental justice more broadly.

N2  - Queer Sites in Global Contexts showcases a variety of cross-cultural perspectives that foreground the physical and online experiences of LGBTQ+ people living in the Caribbean, South and North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia.
The individual chapters-a collection of research-based texts by scholars around the world-provide twelve compelling case studies: queer sites that include buildings, digital networks, natural landscapes, urban spaces, and non-normative bodies. By prioritizing divergent histories and practices of queer life in geographies that are often othered by dominant queer studies in the West-female sex workers, people of color, indigenous populations, Latinx communities, trans identities, migrants-the book constructs thoroughly situated, nuanced discussions on queerness through a variety of research methods.
The book presents tangible examples of empirical research and practice-based work in the fields of queer and gender studies; geography, architectural, and urban theory; and media and digital culture. Responding to the critical absence surrounding experiences of non-White queer folk in Western academia, Queer Sites in Global Contexts acts as a timely resource for scholars, activists, and thinkers interested in queer placemaking practices-both spatial and digital-of diverse cultures.

N2  - Uniform Feelings explores emotions and U.S. policing. Utilizing a mix of clinical case studies, autotheory, and ethnographic research, Jessi Lee Jackson examines the emotional and psychological forces that shape U.S. police power. She begins with her work as a psychotherapist working across the spectrum of relationships to policing, and then turns to interrogate carceral psychology--the involvement of her profession in ongoing state violence. The book then shifts toward trainings, museums, and memorials that illuminate the psychic life of policing, and the possibility for its transformation. Within her investigation of clinical practice, Jackson offers a critique of contemporary police psychology, which constructs police as vulnerable heroes in need of protection and normalizes a celebration of gun culture. She also explores the police claim of premature death for officers alongside the creation of premature death for those targeted by policing. Jackson then turns to police psychology's participation in training and consulting with police departments, highlighting that these efforts do not serve to restrain police power, but to legitimate it. In the final section of the book, Jackson explores fantasies and mourning processes around policing at police memorials and museums, rapidly expanding sites where public feelings and state violence collide.

N2  - "...a little book with big ambitions... Each chapter shows in poignant and powerful ways how anthropologists can marshal evidence against war and related conflict." · American Ethnologist "It is sobering, but also provocative to look at war from the viewpoint of anthropologists, especially those who have had the unique experience of being in zones of war. These essays bring special insights, but also a passion missing in the usual journalistic accounts or scholarly reflections. The writers in this volume not only enlarge our perspective but move us emotionally - a rare and admirable combination." · Howard Zinn As we move deeper into the twenty-first century, power, lethal force, and injustice continue to explode violently into war, and the prospects for lasting peace look even bleaker. The horrors of modern warfare - the death, dehumanization, and destruction of social and material infrastructures - have done little to bring an end to armed conflict. In this volume, leading chroniclers of war provide thoughtful and powerful essays that reflect on their ethnographic work at the frontlines. The contributors recount not only what they have seen and heard in war zones but also what is being read, studied, analyzed and remembered in such diverse locations as Colombia and Guatemala, Israel and Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. In detailed reports from the field, they reflect on the important issue of “accountability” and offer explanations to discern causes, patterns, and practices of war. Through this unique lens, the contributors provide the insight and analysis needed for a deeper understanding of one of the greatest issues of our times.

N2  - There has been growing acknowledgment among scholars, prison staff and policy-makers that gender-informed thinking should feed into penal policy but must be implemented holistically if gains are to be made in reducing trauma, saving lives, ensuring emotional wellbeing and promoting desistance from crime. This means that not only healthcare services and psychology programmes must be sensitive to individuals’ trauma histories but that the architecture and design of prisons should also be sympathetic, facilitating and encouraging trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive practices within. This article problematises the Trauma-Informed Care and Practice (TICP) initiatives recently rolled out across the female prison estate, arguing that attempts to introduce trauma-sensitive services in establishments that are replete with hostile architecture, overt security paraphernalia, and dilapidated fixtures and fittings is futile. Using examples from healthcare and custodial settings, the article puts forward suggestions for prison commissioners, planners and architects which we believe will have novel implications for prison planning and penal practice in the UK and beyond.

N2  - Community members returning from incarceration experience serious health disparities, which intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, community health workers with lived experience of incarceration in the Transitions Clinic Network established a California reentry health care hotline to support time-sensitive linkages to postrelease medical care. From June 2020 to June 2023, the hotline supported 1276 people transitioning from incarceration. Lessons from this peer-led public health intervention are relevant for states utilizing Medicaid waivers to improve health equity for justice- involved populations.

N2  - Self-stigma is pervasive among adults with mental health, drug use, and carceral histories. Yet, existing instruments are limited because they are lengthy and capture a single type of self-stigma, imposing significant respondent burden and resulting in incomplete assessment. This study describes the development and psychometric evaluation of a brief instrument of criminal justice (CJ), opioid use disorder (OUD), and mental health disorder (MHD) combined self-stigma. Participants ( N = 213) were justice-involved adults with OUD and MHD who completed a survey from August 2023 to January 2024 on sociodemographic characteristics; three validated measures of self-stigma; psychological distress; active concealment of CJ, OUD, and MHD; and health-related quality of life (QOL). Analyses included exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Four exploratory factor analysis models were compared. Fit indices, factor loadings, and the meaning of factor indicators were examined. MHD self-stigma was associated with greater psychological distress ( p < .001), more active concealment ( p < .001), and poorer mental health QOL ( p = .001). CJ self-stigma was associated with more active concealment ( p = .007) but also better mental health QOL ( p < .001). While correlated with MHD and CJ self-stigma, OUD self-stigma was not related to the health outcomes ( p > .05 for all outcomes). OUD, MHD, and CJ self-stigma are correlated yet distinct and can be measured with a single, brief 12-item instrument. Preliminary construct validity was supported through associations with poorer health, but further evaluation of the validity and reliability of the brief instrument is needed.

N2  - This afterword reflects upon the not guilty verdict and the media reportage that followed the conclusion of the murder trial of Constable Zachary Rolfe. After the lifting of media embargoes, a plethora of new material was delivered into the public domain. Much of this material was forensic and voyeuristic in approach, dedicated to expanding the narrative of endemic physical violence in Kumunjayi Walker's background while humanizing and heroising the police officer acquitted of his murder. Rendered invisible were the long and brutal history of colonial policing, as well as more recent and particular shifts in the culture and intensity of carceral practice in the Northern Territory. Kumunjayi Walker's shooting occurred at the culmination of the systematic displacement of Warlpiri authority by an endless horizon of securitised governance.

N2  - The concept of carbon lock-in has been applied to the infrastructure, institutions, and discourses that lock society into carbon technologies, and simultaneously lock out lower-carbon alternatives. However, climate transitions have implications that extend beyond carbon and related environmental considerations. Systems of social inequality are also inextricably linked to and impacted by climate change governance and related actions. This article develops a framework to analyze inequality lock-in and disruption as part of climate transitions in particular sectors or industries. We conceptualize four distinct forms of climate transitions in relation to inequality: decarbonization lock-in, adaptation lock-in, decarbonization disruption, and adaptation disruption. Moreover, the framework conceptualizes the material mechanisms through which inequality is locked-in, or alternatively, disrupted by climate actions. Applying this framework to analyze the case of incarceration in the United States suggests that decarbonization and climate adaptation policies and practices are currently weighted toward further locking-in inequality in carceral systems.

N2  - A substantial part of Foucault's work is dedicated of the prison. He is seen as one of the major theorists of this institution. However, he is also a major epistemologist. In this contribution, we shall develop a Foucauldian approach to interrogate Foucault's model of prison. In this respect, we shall address the carceral question in the context of the mobility turn. More precisely, we shall investigate the extent to which the development of a new relation to space-time and the emergence of a 'mobilitarian ideology', praising mobility for itself, influence the way the prison is now ruled and legitimated.

N2  - A general shift in U.S. efforts to reduce crime via prevention and rehabilitation juxtaposed with the continued implementation of punitive policies, many of which disproportionately impact Black communities, raises questions about mechanisms underlying crime policy preferences. One concern is that the public is more willing to invest in policing and corrections when those practices are thought to primarily impact people of color. In a set of studies, the current research assesses how people allocate money across a variety of crime policies and evaluates how those decisions are influenced by perceptions of racial disparities in the U.S. prison population. The two studies also explore how support for those budgetary decisions is influenced by concerns about crime. Findings indicate that presenting participants with information about racial disparities in the prison population does not affect policy support, but that attitudes about race still play a role in crime control policy preferences. Findings from Study 1 reveal that participants who believe violent crime is more of a "Black" phenomenon typically invest more into carceral interventions and less into therapeutic interventions. However, this relationship is contingent on the policy options offered (Study 2). Implications for policy debates and future research directions are discussed.

N2  - Many jail facilities provide limited access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD), despite it being the standard of care. We aim to explore the perspectives of opioid treatment providers (OTPs) on access to MOUD for pregnant people while incarcerated and postincarceration.
We conducted 16 semistructured phone interviews with providers and administrators representing 16 unique OTPs in various U.S. states with high maternal opioid use rates. We developed the interview guide using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and we analyzed interview transcripts using a direct content analysis.
Nine participants reported having an arrangement with a carceral facility to provide care for pregnant people with OUD; however, others described how their local jail offered no OUD treatment for incarcerated pregnant people. Even if participants' clinics had arrangements to provide MOUD in a jail, most participants described significant barriers to continuity of care between jails and community providers as patients transition between jails and community settings. OTPs described their belief of how postincarceration, pregnant people experience barriers to OUD care such as lack of access to childcare, preparing for the baby, feeling unwell, in addition to the barriers that nonpregnant patients experience, such as transportation, housing, and financing.
OTPs perceive that pregnant people with OUD experience significant barriers to accessing treatment while incarcerated and in community settings due to discrimination, difficulties in continuity of care, and lack of treatment access while incarcerated. The implementation of evidence-based MOUD treatment for pregnant people in jail and continuation of treatment upon release is crucial to reduce health disparities.
•Treatment providers note stigma for jailed pregnant people who use opioids.•Regulations and linkages to opioid treatment providers constrain treatment in jail.•Continuity of care for pregnant people between jails and communities is crucial.•Collaboration between jails and community providers facilitates treatment.

N2  - In this article we use our collaborative work with a support group for families of incarcerated people in upstate New York—including participant observation, interviews and focus groups from 2019‐2020—to highlight how COVID‐19 exacerbated challenges they already faced in caring for kin across walls. We focus specifically during the summer of 2020 when New York state prison visitation was closed to prevent the spread of COVID, showing how families struggled to stay connected and also organized to fight the carceral system. We suggest that through these acts of resistance and care, people on the outside caring for incarcerated kin during the pandemic can be understood as what Joy James calls the “captive maternal.” Understanding these women as “captive maternals” within a system structured by racial capitalism renders explicit the way the logics of captivity extend beyond the walls of prisons and jails to shape the experiences of their kin on the outside. It reveals these women to be not simply compassionate individuals caring for people they love, but rather as resistors fighting through their acts of care the logics of abandonment, disposability, and anti‐blackness on which contemporary American society is built, and which people nationwide were protesting.

N2  - Foucault spent time investigating the stopping of mobilities, notably when studying carceral spaces such as asylums and prisons which effectively immobilise their inmates at a societal scale. In Discipline and Punish, he speculates on how such spaces are designed to put a stop to casual 'nomadisms'. The purpose here is to inspect this aspect of Foucault's thinking, particularly to recover what he also said about the regulation and cultivation of mobilities within the depths of immobility. Attention is also drawn to an engagement with mobility-immobility appearing in Foucault's little-discussed Psychiatric Power lectures, prompted by the ideas and practices of Edouard Seguin, an educator of 'idiot' children, whose own words provide additional 'empirical' weight to an emerging argument. Reading the unabridged English translation of Madness and Civilization, a final claim is that Foucault's phenomenology of 'madness' depends upon unruly mobilities within the asylum, the very stuff of 'unstable and dangerous coagulation'. The overall ambition is to furnish an alternative account of Foucault and mobilities, concentrating on those Foucauldian texts initially seeming the least promising for scholars of mobilities.

N2  - The global climate crisis is the most significant, potentially irreversible environmental threat to humanity we face.1 In the last three years, we have experienced the warmest years on global record, and the number of extreme climate-related events is projected to increase.2 The negative impacts of these events are disproportionate across different populations: Black individuals are 40% more likely than White people to reside in areas with the highest projected increases in extreme temperature-related deaths.3One understudied factor that may exacerbate the impact of climate disaster events on individuals is incarceration status. Incarceration is a key facet of structural racism in the United States. The United States contains 25% of the world's incarcerated population despite making up less than 5% of the world's overall population, and marginalized individuals are overrepresented in these settings.4 Carceral systems have historically experienced heightened morbidity and mortality from climate disasters when systems have not evacuated facilities or taken other preventative actions; this was evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where residents of Orleans Parish, Louisiana prisons were left in their cells without water, food, and ventilation for days while correctional staff left their posts.5 In addition, jails and prisons themselves present environmental risk. Prisons contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and people inside are regularly exposed to contaminated water, hazardous waste, and food insecurity.6Despite this, there is currently no unified federal plan to provide oversight or relief to incarcerated people during climate disaster events. As a result, states are responsible for developing and enacting emergency management (EM) plans that cover the entire state, including those living in congregate settings. The design and implementation of these plans vary state to state, with specific tasks delegated to relevant state agencies, departments, and sometimes nongovernmental organizations. To identify how incarcerated people are represented in climate disaster response, we reviewed state and department of correction (DOC) policies on disaster planning.

N2  - Hawai'i faces a crisis of homelessness due to the high cost of housing across the islands. Many without formal housing establish interdependent communities unsanctioned by property regimes and refer to themselves as "houseless" because intimate relations with place and expansive practices of care provide an adequate home. Attending to the experiences of Hawai'i's houseless, I unpack the meanings and practices of organized abandonment while proposing that some face structural neglect by "living with abandon." I argue that the rupturing of life-giving relations entwined with particular places serve as a foundation of organized abandonment. Devolution, state retrenchment, the intensification of land use for revenue-oriented development, and a punitive carceral state layer upon this foundational rupture to propel the continual abandonment of shared resources. This enables the ongoing circulation of capital through the environment. In response, people live with abandon by rejecting, or holding an ambivalent relationship with, aspirations to thrive within capitalism. Living with abandon is a form of creative improvisation that cultivates connections in the face of broken relations, yet remains defined by uncertainty and heartbreak. It both invokes the fullness of time and space and mourns the losses that have produced the tenuous present.

N2  - Extensive health inequities exist for persons with criminal-legal involvement in the USA. Researchers, both novice and experienced, are critical in documenting these inequities and implementing programs that address the many health and social problems of this population. However, working with currently or formerly incarcerated persons brings new challenges to researchers that may have not been previously considered as necessary. Because incarcerated persons were systemically exploited by biomedical researchers until reform following the Civil Rights Movement, resulting in their designation as a vulnerable population in the Code of Federal Regulations, enhanced protections are necessary in implementing contemporary research involving incarcerated persons. These enhanced protections can delay or prolong the regulatory approval process, particularly to the novice carceral system researcher, which may discourage some from engaging with this important population. Drawing on the many years of experience working with incarcerated persons accumulated by the Sexual Health Empowerment (S)HE Team at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), this article offers some concrete steps toward getting started in this work.

N2  - Exploring a wide range of settings and circumstances in which individuals or groups of people have been forced to move from one geographical location to another, the case studies in this volume demonstrate what archaeology can reveal about the agents, causes, processes, and effects of human removal.
Contributors focus on material culture and the built environment at colonial villages, frontier farms, industrial complexes, natural disaster areas, and other sites of removal dating from the colonization of North America to the present. They address topics including class, race, memory, identity, and violence. One essay investigates the link between mapmaking and the relocation of Mississippi Chickasaw people to Oklahoma. Another essay uses archival research to problematize the establishment of the National Park Service and the displacement of Appalachian mountain communities; it shows how uprooted people challenged stereotypes and popular narratives circulated by mass media. Additionally, excavations of a World War II–era Japanese American internment camp illustrate how the incarcerated marshaled new social networks to maintain their cultural identities. Research on other carceral sites exposes the ways banishment from society obscures the pervasive violence exerted on prison populations. A concluding chapter grapples with unexpected consequences of removal, as archaeologists paradoxically benefit from the existence of sites previously ignored by the historical record.
The archaeologists in this volume broaden our understanding of displacement by identifying parallels with removal experiences occurring today. As they shed light on ongoing global problems of removal, these case studies point to ways descendants, victims, and indigenous people have sought and continue to seek social justice.

N2  - As critical scholars of public education and mass incarceration, we witness in our daily work the soft coercive migration of youth of color, especially poor youth of color, out of sites of public education and into militarized and carceral corners of the public sphere. We watch as educators and youth try to negotiate conditions of systematic miseducation, criminalization, and the scientism of high‐stakes testing. And we observe how ideologies about merit, deservingness, and blame drip feed into the soul, tagging some bodies as worthy and others as damaged. We write this essay to make visible this critical geography of youth development and dispossession. Signaling how public dollars, ideologies, and opportunities map onto adolescent bodies and redistribute their dreams and aspirational capacities, we draw from multiple sources and disciplines to articulate the raced and classed capillaries and consequences of this new imperialism at home on U.S. soil. Specifically we use a wide range of data sources, disciplines, and research methods to demonstrate the deep penetration of youth dispossession through state sanctioned policies or the state's oversight; either option having the same value outcome—the dispossession of Black, Brown, immigrant and poor bodies.

Hailing from significantly different intellectual vantage points and personal experiences, the contributors to this forum are scholars of language and meaningmaking who consider an array of practices and structures that sustain anti‐Blackness and/or consider those that nourish anti‐anti‐Blackness.

N2  - Following a series of transformative political and legal battles, California's overcrowded prison system has moved in the direction of moderate decarceration. A softer stance on punishment means that thousands of previously ineligible inmates serving indeterminate sentences are now being considered for release on parole. Drawing on ethnographic observations of twenty parole hearings in one California men's prison, this study outlines how rehabilitation has come to be enmeshed in a logic of punitivity, as parole commissioners subject inmates to an individualizing gaze that misrecognizes the socially embedded nature of their performance. Parole commissioners are tasked with assessing dangerousness, deploying a multifaceted conception of risk that combines formalized actuarial instruments and evaluative judgments to form the inchoate and contradictory notion of “insight.” Inmates are expected to demonstrate this if they are to be released, but what is insight? Parole boards assume that it is a valid indicator of future behavior and probable recidivism, and parole commissioners posit that successful inmates will be capable of demonstrating authentic remorse and insight, unimpeded by the constraints of an austere and dangerous carceral environment. However, the discretionary criteria established by the penal system are limited by the deleterious living conditions established by this same penal system.

N2  - This paper provides a commentary on the theme section entitled "Troubling Institutions at the Nexus of Care and Control." Using the recent book Matters of Care (2017) by Maria Puig de la Bellacasa as a reference point, the authors of the commentary introduce the project of exploring how care and control admix across a range of institutional geographies, reflecting complex assemblages of places, peoples, practices and problems. Taking seriously the prompt by the section editors to think about the "troubling" of institutions, the authors draw provisional distinctions between those that are "troubled" and those that are "troublesome," mapping across to the range of more-or-less institutional - more-or-less carceral - spaces considered in the papers comprising the theme section. The commentary concludes with attention, inspired by Donna Haraway's notion of "staying with the trouble," to the task of staying both with the troubles bundled up in institutional landscapes and, indeed, with the very idea and practice of institutions themselves.

N2  - Thousands of pregnant women pass through our nation's jails every year. What happens to them as they carry their pregnancies in a space of punishment? In this time when the public safety net is frayed, incarceration has become a central and racialized strategy for managing the poor. Using her ethnographic fieldwork and clinical work as an ob-gyn in a women's jail, Carolyn Sufrin explores how jail has, paradoxically, become a place where women can find care. Focusing on the experiences of incarcerated pregnant women as well as on the practices of the jail guards and health providers who care for them,Jailcaredescribes the contradictory ways that care and maternal identity emerge within a punitive space presumed to be devoid of care. Sufrin argues that jail is not simply a disciplinary institution that serves to punish. Rather, when understood in the context of the poverty, addiction, violence, and racial oppression that characterize these women's lives and their reproduction, jail can become a safety net for women on the margins of society.

N2  - The contributors to Long Term use the tension between the popular embrace and legalization of same-sex marriage and the queer critique of homonormativity as an opportunity to examine the myriad forms of queer commitments and their durational aspect. They consider commitment in all its guises, particularly relationships beyond and aside from monogamous partnering. These include chosen and involuntary long-term commitments to families, friends, pets, and coworkers; to the care of others and care of self; and to financial, psychiatric, and carceral institutions. Whether considering the enduring challenges of chronic illnesses and disability, including HIV and chronic fatigue syndrome; theorizing the queer family as a scene of racialized commitment; or relating the grief and loss that comes with caring for pets, the contributors demonstrate that attending to the long term offers a fuller understanding of queer engagements with intimacy, mortality, change, dependence, and care.Contributors.

N2  - Mass incarceration has been shown to be a force of racializations and class inequality in US life, but little literature has focused on the lives of prison guards. Highlighting the lived experiences of prison guards at two state maximum security prisons in Elmira, New York, a small multiracial city in central New York State, this article uses Cedric Robinson's notion of racial capitalism to show how prison expansion unfolds in New York State at the end of the twentieth century. Guard labor includes both the physical work of control and of basic social reproduction and is done by people who are connected to the cultures, histories, and political economies in which they were raised, what Elmirans often call one's "hometown." I examine prison guards' narratives of their racial encounters inside and outside the prison, their sense of their racialized selves, and their relationship to what they see as often boring, violent, and stigmatized work. I show how the expansion of the carceral state over the past forty years, the period most often referred to as mass incarceration, maintains Fordism's labor hierarchies in a retooled racialization: as jailer and jailed.

N2  - The rapid spread of highly transmissible respiratory infections in carceral settings occurs due to their conglomerate nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in large outbreaks in jails and prisons in many settings. Herein, we describe an outbreak of SARS-CoV2 infection in a prison in Alicante, Spain. Prior to January 2021, testing for coronavirus infection was not widely available in jails and prisons nationwide. Offering of testing services in Spanish carceral facilities, coincided with the deployment of COVID-19 vaccination in the larger community. However, COVID-19 vaccine role out of incarcerated individuals occurred later during the deployment plan. With the identification of the initial cases of this outbreak, two units of the facility were assigned for population management: one for inmates with confirmed infection by positive PCR detection of SARS-COV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs. Inmates with confirmed exposure and thus considered close contacts were place in a second isolation unit. Functional quarantine was employed in some instances. A reactive testing strategy was instituted at baseline, and at 7 and 14 days of nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. A total of 1,097 nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained for PCR testing during the outbreak, which lasted a total of 80 days between the index case the end of medical isolation of the last case. A total of 103 COVID-19 cases were identified during the outbreak. Of these, three inmates developed severe manifestations requiring hospitalization, and one died. Were identified, among which there were three hospitalized and one deceased. Among cases and confirmed contacts, we conducted close clinical monitoring, symptom screening, and daily temperature checks. The implementation of these interventions along with early medical isolation of cases, quarantining of contacts, and interval testing to detect presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases were instrumental in containing this outbreak.

N2  - Public health institutions are playing an increasingly central role in everyday life as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., through stay-at-home orders, contact tracing, and the enforcement of disease control measures by law enforcement). In light of this, we consider how COVID-19 disparities and disease control practices intersect with the response to the more longstanding epidemic of HIV infection in Canada and the United States. In a series of developments that predate COVID-19, the HIV response has been shaped by advances in antiretroviral treatment that made HIV infection a manageable condition for people with continuous access to high-quality health care. However, the HIV response has also involved the emergence of novel forms of public health surveillance, sometimes punitive disease control measures, and criminalization measures that have been criticized by people living with HIV and critical public health scholars.1 Developments in this area include the increased use of novel forms of phylogenetic analysis and molecular surveillance without individual consent or community consultation. In 2020, multiple epidemiological research groups published articles noting that they have begun to use phylogenetic analysis of HIV genetic sequence data (also called "molecular" HIV data) to infer the direction of HIV transmission between two individuals (i.e., to discern if "person A" transmitted HIV to "person B") with greater precision than was previously possible.2 This has raised concerns about how analyses of these data may propel prosecution of alleged HIV transmission or nondisclosure. In the context of COVID-19, we have also witnessed enhanced collaboration between police and public health as well as an expansion of policing in response to the pandemic. Critical public health scholarship4 can help make sense of how criminal law, the logics of criminalization, and public health work may be converging in new ways. As critical public health scholars, we argue that critical public health research agendas in this area can have the most impact when they (1) center race and racism, (2) investigate how public health surveillance technologies operate across key HIV disparity groups and across health systems (i.e., on the body, in laboratories, in health departments, and in care settings), and (3) enhance understandings of carceral public health practices.

N2  - This research builds on and extends critical environmental justice research into carceral spaces. Here, the focus is on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on the lessons provided by the Black Lives Matter social movement and critical race theory, this research draws connections between the institutionalized racism in the criminal justice system and immigration policies. The nativist and racist rationale for harsh immigration policies asserts that callous treatment of immigrants makes U.S. society safer. However, the blow back from these policies makes U.S. society less secure and degrades the civil and political rights for all. Informed by a riskscape framework, we pursue multiscalar and empirical research into this blow back. Riskscapes encompass different viewpoints on the threat of loss across space, time, individuals, and collectives. More tangibly, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICE detention facilities provided ideal conditions for the infection to spread among the people detained, visitors, and staff. The walls and fences surrounding ICE facilities did not prevent the spread of infection to nearby communities, counties, and regions. Heightened infection rates provide tangible (and tragic) evidence of the blow back from the callousness of U.S. immigration policies in general and of ICE facilities in specific. This synthesis of critical environmental justice and riskscapes literatures lays the foundation for a textured and multi-layered understanding of the unequal and institutional dimensions of risks in and around carceral facilities.

N2  - Environmental injustice occurs when marginalized groups face disproportionate environmental impacts from a range of threats. Environmental racism is a particular form of environmental injustice and frequently includes the implementation of policies, regulations, or institutional practices that target communities of color for undesirable waste sites, zoning, and industry. One example of how the United States federal and state governments are currently practicing environmental racism is in the form of building and maintaining toxic prisons and immigrant detention prisons, where people of color and undocumented persons are the majority of inmates and detainees who suffer disproportionate health risk and harms. This article discusses the historical and contemporary conditions that have shaped the present political landscape of racial and immigration conflicts and considers those dynamics in the context of the literature on environmental justice. Case studies are then presented to highlight specific locations and instances that exemplify environmental injustice and racism in the carceral sector. The article concludes with an analysis of the current political drivers and motivations contributing to these risks and injustices, and ends with a discussion of the scale and depth of analysis required to alleviate these impacts in the future, which might contribute to greater sustainability among the communities affected.

N2  - This article examines the role that data-driven technologies play in expanding and reasserting the legitimacy of the US racial state during times of crisis. Specifically, I examine how prison officials used a software called Verus to reinforce the perceived necessity of penal institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government officials used Verus to produce narratives that (1) recast criminalized communities as dangerous and therefore disposable and (2) shielded carceral institutions from liability for systematic neglect. Ultimately, the aim of this article is to contribute to emerging critical concepts such as “data colonialism,” a term that has largely been used to describe the social and economic consequences of parasitic data extraction and monopoly control of digital infrastructure. In addition to these issues, I argue that data-driven technologies are used as vehicles for movement capture and the reproduction of prison logics that enable modes of racialized economic exploitation that extend far beyond the high-tech innovation economy.

N2  - The “Bastille Effect” refers to the unique ways that former sites of political imprisonment are transformed, physically and culturally. In their afterlives, these sites represent sustained efforts to hold perpetrators accountable for state violence. For that narrative to surface, the sites must be cleansed of their profane past. In some cases, clergy are even enlisted to perform purifying rituals that grant the sites a new identity as memorials. Around the globe, carceral sites have been dramatically repurposed into places of enlightenment that offer inspiring allegories of human rights. Interpreting the complexities of those common threads, this book weaves together a broad range of cultural, interdisciplinary, and critical thought to offer new insights into the study of political imprisonment, collective memory, and post-conflict societies. “The scholarly work of Michael Welch is recognized for its blend of critical theory and human rights. The Bastille Effect is no exception. This book reveals the terrible depths— and pains—of political imprisonment.” KIERAN MCEVOY, Queen’s University, Belfast “With compelling case studies, this wide-ranging book expands the significance of human rights to political imprisonment, technologies of power, and the meaning of memory.” DIEGO ZYSMAN QUIRÓS, University of Buenos Aires “Welch’s highly original project on the afterlife of sites of political imprisonment throws new critical light onto the politics of punishment and represents an important contribution to the burgeoning study of comparative penality.” TIM NEWBURN, London School of Economics

N2  - Mass incarceration refers to the system of social and racial control in the United States that arrests, convicts, incarcerates, and supervises racial and ethnic minority populations through probation and parole. Mass incarceration is referred to as “mass” because the current size of this system in the United States is historically and internationally unparalleled. Mass incarceration affects those who are incarcerated and under community supervision, as well as the families and communities where it is concentrated.1 Mass incarceration is a pervasive cause of health inequities in the United States.2 Yet, it has long been absent from both public health institutional priorities and core graduate training in public health. Mass incarceration is absent from the required curricula in general public health programs and even specialty programs focused on health equity and sociostructural determinants of health. Given this lack of prioritization and formal education and training, public health scholars may overlook the critical role it plays in individual and community health and the key it holds to achieving health equity. Increased broad awareness of the harms of mass incarceration is needed to disrupt its connection to health inequities and to abolish this system of social and racial control.In the United States in 2020, the criminal legal system directly affected almost 7 million people daily, with 2.3 million people incarcerated in state and federal prisons, local jails, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, and 4.4 million under community supervision.3 Criminal legal involvement is not random: Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Latinx people with a high school education or lower have a higher likelihood of criminal legal involvement than their non-Hispanic White and more highly educated counterparts.3 In addition, while men make up the majority of those incarcerated, women are the fastest-growing segment of the prison population, and non-White women are disproportionately represented.3 Familial incarceration is also common and unequally distributed; 1 in 3 young people will have a parent who is incarcerated, and 45% of people in the United States will have an immediate family member who is incarcerated.4People experiencing incarceration at any point in life have disproportionately poor physical health (eg, increased HIV incidence) and mental health (eg, trauma) before, during, and after incarceration.2 This disproportion was especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. In prisons, between April 2021 and April 2022, the rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases was 5 times greater and the mortality rate was 3 times greater than in the general population.5 The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted how the criminal legal system and population health are intricately linked. Throughout the pandemic, COVID-19 spread in carceral facilities contributed substantially to community spread and vice versa,6,7 underscoring the importance of mass incarceration to community health and health equity. Beyond COVID-19, incarceration also harms the health of nonincarcerated family members through increased stress and trauma, widespread stigma, and financial deprivation.8 Mass incarceration erodes community mental health and alters the social ecology of neighborhoods by eroding social capital and disrupting social and family networks.9 The residents of these neighborhoods also experience poor physical health and have a high prevalence of asthma and sexually transmitted infections.10,11 Given the widespread and disproportionate reach of the criminal legal system and its many direct and indirect effects on health, this system contributes to extreme health inequities.

N2  - Police violence shapes the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, and while much has been written about strategic responses to police, missing is an examination of how black women navigate interactions with officers. Based on 32 interviews with black women, we find that they use witnessing, or the mobilization of others as observers to police encounters. Research demonstrates the rising role of videos and smartphones in documenting encounters with officers. We find that black women adapt witnessing techniques based on their surroundings, available resources, and network contacts. Three forms of witnessing are observed: physical witnessing, mobilizing others in close proximity to interactions with officers; virtual witnessing, using cellphone or social media technology to contact others or record interactions with officers; and institutional witnessing, leveraging police or other institutional contacts as interveners to interactions with officers. Black women mobilize witnessing to deescalate violence, gather evidence, and promote accountability. Attuned to both the interactional and structural dynamics of police encounters, black women conceptualize witnessing as a way to survive police encounters and navigate their legal estrangement within the carceral system. We theorize black women’s witnessing as a form of resistance as they work to reconfigure short- and long-term power relations between themselves, their communities, and police.

N2  - Strict regulations are in place for conducting research with prisoners. Published studies are limited that focus on improving the health and well-being of incarcerated persons. Subsequently, institutional review boards established methods to guide researchers in conducting fair and ethical research in carceral settings. The authors of this paper discuss some of the methodological challenges that exist when conducting research with incarcerated persons. Unique methodological challenges were found during the process of conducting a research study inside a jail setting. The authors discuss challenges and provide guidance for future studies. Despite challenges, researchers can conduct studies that can benefit incarcerated persons.

N2  - This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between spatial control and care in nursing homes governed by Finnish municipalities. Although the attitude towards elderly care is gradually changing, most nursing homes governed by Finnish municipalities are still traditional, large institutions. In the study, I examine how care and control emerge spatially in nursing homes and how living in a limited environment shapes the everyday life of the residents. I argue that spatial practices affect the well-being of the residents, since a great deal of the control in Finnish nursing homes is spatiotemporal. The institutions use multiple methods to control residents, such as limiting mobility and daily routines, which can also result in unintended mistreatment. As the analysis demonstrates, staff and their attitudes have a significant effect on the residents' well-being. It also underlines how feelings of self-determination or "imagined" liberty can relieve anxiety and feelings of being confined. Control may be needed to keep residents safe; however, there is a risk that control can merge into care which affects staff culture and the well-being of residents. This paper responds to the call for greater diversity within carceral geography, and conceptualises the nursing home as a complex (quasi-)carceral environment that sits uneasily on the continuum between care and control.

N2  - Using publicly available archives, statistical reports, government audits, media accounts, pharmacy databases, prison records, corporate accounting, and court cases, Hatch shows how knowledge about mental illness management in the broader carceral state is produced and concealed. Some are managed by for-profit companies, which connects to Hatch's political economic analysis of the pharmaceutical industry's long-standing and profitable prisoner experimental apparatus in Chapter 3. Silent Cells will be of interest to historians of carceral institutions and pharmaceuticals, criminologists, science and technology scholars, mental health providers, critics of psychiatric and carceral control, and others interested in the expansive, insidious mechanics that sustain the U.S. carceral state.

N2  - Drug-use surveillance systems appear in this paper as symptomatic "technologies of suspicion" that constitute a set of empirical modes for producing and interpreting "data" or test results in ways that conflate prediction with prescription, acting as technological forms of supervision, monitoring, supposed deterrence, and ultimately control. Technologies of suspicion are predicated upon a framework of trust; they are deployed within a "system of takings-for-granted" that presupposes trust and thus makes distrust possible. Drug-testing provides an excellent example of the institutionalization of distrust through the deployment of technologies of suspicion not only within institutions but beyond their real and virtual walls. The paper considers the also considers the decentralization and deinstitutionalization of distrust, the capillary dispersion of suspicion throughout the carceral society, and the role of distrust in underwriting the development of certain kinds of knowledge systems and technologies, forms of social and cognitive order, and the functional dispersion of police practices to individuals such as parents, teachers, and peers. Studying why bio-surveillance modalities should diffuse despite their unreliability and their contribution to a generalized climate of suspicion enables the characterization of certain features of the post-sovereign subject in a post-disciplinary regime Reprinted by permission of Surveillance & Society

N2  - Self-efficacy and digital literacy are key predictors to incarcerated people’s success in the modern workplace. While digitization in correctional facilities is expanding, few templates exist for how to design computing curricula that foster self-efficacy and digital literacy in carceral environments. As a result, formerly incarcerated people face increasing social and professional exclusion post-release. We report on a 12-week college-accredited web design class, taught virtually and synchronously, across 5 correctional facilities across the United States. The program brought together men and women from gender-segregated facilities into one classroom to learn fundamentals in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and create websites addressing social issues of their choosing. We conducted surveys with participating students, using dichotomous and open-ended questions, and performed thematic and quantitative analyses of their responses that suggest students’ increased self-efficacy. Our study discusses key design choices, needs, and recommendations for furthering computing curricula that foster self-efficacy and digital literacy in carceral settings.

N2  - Disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive while the consequences for incarcerated persons have grown increasingly visible. Simultaneously, scholars, individuals, and communities are grappling with police brutality and systemic anti-Black racism in the criminal legal system by engaging with the concept of abolition. In this article we demonstrate that these issues are not disconnected and argue that the abolition of the prison industrial complex (PIC) would mitigate the impacts of disasters for incarcerated persons and their communities. Incarceration undermines individual and collective resilience needed to recover from disasters, whereas carceral infrastructure facilitates disaster harm to incarcerated persons and their communities. Incarceration itself mirrors the harm and destruction of a disaster. Abolition of the PIC would not only prevent harm from incarceration, but also systems of accountability put in place by communities as suggested by abolitionists would contribute to the resilience of individuals and communities. By examining these connections, we provide a framework for considerations of abolition in an era of reckoning with anti-Blackness, the violence of the criminal legal system, and climate change, and suggest further investment of research in these areas.

N2  - Despite the emergence of critical gang studies such as Lopez-Aguado (2018), Durán (2018), and Barganier (2011) that have called for an interrogation of the complicity of academic modes of knowledge production in processes of the racialization of gang-involved individuals, Criminology has largely remained dependent on legal definitions of gangs. These state and federal legal definitions remain fixated on individuals' engagement in illegal activity as a core component in defining gang members. Gangs, then, are understood as criminals and need hyper-surveillance and elimination. In this chapter, I examine the role that knowing the "gang member" plays in processes of policing-itself a project of racialized dehumanization. I interrogate the relationship between criminological knowledge production and the racialized dehumanization of self- and/or state-identified gang members subjected to gang policing. I argue that knowing gangs and gang members as criminal and thus undeserving of humanity, compassion, social value, and/or redemption, criminology sustains what I call a neo-colonial-carceral social order that justifies the aggressive and punitive treatment of "criminal gang members." Thus, this chapter calls for developing a decolonial theoretical model that recognizes gangs as subcultures of resistance designed to overthrow the oppressive colonial conditions, which made the emergence of gangs and their members possible. In doing so, I challenge mainstream definitions and understandings of gangs and gang members.
The central argument of this chapter is that gang scholars must develop and center a decolonial theoretical model to fully deconstruct how coloniality and carcerality converge to create a neo-colonial-carceral social order/apparatus that subjects gangs and gang members to a colonial carceral gaze that further positions them as vulnerable human targets of neo-colonial-carceral State-sanctioned racial violence as manifest by state/police surveillance, police brutality, and incarceration; technologies of oppression/suppression/elimination. The biopsychological approach originating from Cesare Lombroso's 1876 Criminal Man is the foundation of a psychogenic view of delinquency. As the smoke from the 1960s movements began to dissipate and a move toward experimental initiatives for social reform made their way, simultaneously, a new wave of young people began to come together to form gangs. Anti-gang suppression efforts and criminalization of label gang members that renders self-and/or State identified gang members to occupy a zone of nonbeing, a state of ontological subordination, and subhuman status that ultimately results in their premature death.

N2  - Neoliberal governance spurs the contradictory drives of securitization and austerity in the US carceral system. Correctional and parole offices cut costs by relocating care, relying upon the work of Black women, their families, and communities to provide myriad services to their incarcerated and paroled loved ones. Yet while their labor is vital to the reproduction and growth of this system, these same neoliberal processes work systematically to erase it. In doing so, they allow new kinds of unwarranted state surveillance through the private space of the home. In this article, I critically analyze the austerity measures implemented by Pennsylvania’s Department of Corrections, an institution that has undergone extensive reforms since 2012. To do so, I bridge feminist political and economic geographies, examining state processes via an analysis of unpaid reproductive labor, everyday practices, and emotion. Through a three-year ethnographic study with the loved ones of incarcerated people, I show how the state externalizes the cost of supervision onto prisoners’ support networks, relying in varied ways on families for the care and surveillance of prisoners. I show that this covert strategy enables the state to claim reductions in prison populations while, in fact, maintaining containment of formerly incarcerated people. These findings urge increased attention to the state’s dependence on incarcerated people’s support networks, demonstrating the vital insights a feminist geographic perspective offers in this age of austerity.

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is curable, but incarcerated populations face barriers to treatment. In a cohort of incarcerated hospitalized patients in Boston, Massachusetts, HCV infection was associated with increased mortality. Access to HCV treatment in carceral settings is crucial to avoid unnecessary death and to support HCV elimination efforts.

N2  - In 1974, when health care administrator Seth B. Goldsmith published his review of prison health are in Public Health Reports, 400,000 people were incarcerated in the prisons and jails of the US, a number that would jump 5.5 times during the next 40 years. His views reflected careful consideration of the vast neglect and deliberately imposed suffering in what passed for carceral health care. Prison health care, as one of the key manifestations of the dehumanizing of incarcerated people, became a central focus of outcries and lawsuits.

N2  - The goal of this paper is to explore the experiences of formerly incarcerated people navigating mental health care post-release and understand how mistrust of mental health services and providers is manifested among this population. Interviews were conducted between 2021 and 2022 with 25 people released from incarceration within the past five years. We partnered with community organizations to recruit a diverse sample of participants, using voluntary response and purposive sampling. The interview transcripts were coded using a modified grounded theory approach and the analysis further guided by critical phenomenology in order to center silenced or marginalized perspectives. Mistrust of mental health care was a prominent theme across interviews. Overall, participants felt that they did not have autonomy over their treatment planning and management. Participants described experiencing stigmatizing treatment from providers, suspicion of mandated mental health treatment, and believing that profit over patients was prioritized in the industry-all of which contributed to growing mistrust of the larger mental health system. The participants' experiences of losing control over their lives and treatment, compounded by a perceived complicity between mental health and carceral systems, shaped their mistrust toward mental health care. Nevertheless, many demonstrated remarkable persistence in seeking care and engaging with multiple providers, while also actively seeking to reclaim their autonomy.

N2  - According to Haraway, Jameson, and many others, the postmodern postindustrial period opens with the shift in the 1950s and thereafter away from electric and gas energy to electronic and nuclear power, displacing the steam energy of the early industrial era.2 This is the point at which new postwar sciences and technologies flower such as cybernetics, antibiotics, nuclear engineering, television, microelectronics, space travel and later immunology, organ transplants, satellite relaying, and gene splicing. During the modern era such insidious technologies operate increasingly all across the social body from the church, military, school, and factory to the hospital, legal system, and family, forming a "carceral" network. [...]they are operated by social scientists - criminologists, judges, administrators, ministers, doctors, psychologists, teachers. Subtitled "Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism," Haraway's landmark "Cyborg Manifesto" famously labels postmodern society an "informatics of domination," portrayed in detail as a period more momentous in many ways than the onset of industrial capitalism, a new technocratic militarized global information system typified by the unforeseen breakdown of numerous traditional binary concepts such as organism/machine, human/animal, mind/body, subject/object, nature/culture. According to Haraway, "High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways.

N2  - Droplet-borne infectious diseases can spread quickly in overcrowded, poorly ventilated prisons, making it difficult to monitor diseases like COVID-19. Therefore, wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) is essential for tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. We aimed to compare how different sampling methods and assays impact WBS in prisons, focusing on their effect on genomic sequencing to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants in a prison sewage system in Selangor, Malaysia. Raw sewage samples were collected between February, and August 2023, using both grab and composite sampling. The SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) concentration was quantified via reverse transcription digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-dPCR) followed by sequencing using nanopore technology. Among the 90 paired samples, 84 (93.3 %) and 85 (94.4 %) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in grab and composite samples, respectively. There were no significant differences in RNA concentrations between grab and composite samples for N1 (z = -0.885, p = 0.376) and N2 (z = −1.032, p = 0.302). Moderate positive correlations were observed between composite and grab samples, with Pearson's r values of 0.67 and 0.56 for nucleoproteins 1 and 2 (N1 and N2 genes), respectively. Wastewater genomic surveillance consistently identified the same dominant circulating sublineages of the Omicron variant in the prison community via both sampling methods. Moreover, our study highlights the benefits of using different methods to capture variant diversity and assess environmental susceptibility to external sources. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of WBS methods that allow the detection of SARS-CoV-2, its variant, mutation and transmission in carceral settings.
[Display omitted]
•Wastewater surveillance helps assess the burden of COVID-19 in prisons.•Composite sampling should be used in routine analysis to obtain a holistic view of variant circulation.•WBS helps in tracking the presence of variant of concerns (VOCs) in the absence of clinical surveillance.•Various sampling strategies have demonstrated variant diversity and environmental susceptibility.•The WBS will reap future rewards for public health preparedness in prison institutions.

N2  - Colonial states of emergency are declared and promulgated to contain the disorder of rebellion, resistance and revolt and to effect a return to an order integral to colonial settlement and occupation. The paper draws on colonial archives, analysis of emergency and colonialism evident in the literature, and the contribution of images to guide apprehension of the sites and locations of the emergency landscapes and the geographies of resistance of Kenya from the 1950s and across historic Palestine since 1948. Positing the practices enabled through Emergency regulations as intensified forms of instrumentalised colonial governmentality and violence, part of the structure of settler colonialism, the paper examines the racialised vocabularies of the British colonial administration of the Emergency over Kenya and the Zionist/Israeli state/military frames of Palestinian resistance, the technologies and architectures of subjugation and punishment through which the threat of disorder is contained in carceral zones, and the militarised violence of the colonial response to resistance characterised as catastrophic threat from an enemy located within frames of terrorism, disloyalty and illegality. Photographs taken as part of an inquiry into the architectures, remnants, material assemblages and spatial arrangements found in the emergency landscapes and the geographies of resistance of post-colonial Kenya and across the multiple geographies of historic Palestine are included as evidence of the photographic event and as provocation to thought in an encounter with the workings of colonialism and of resistance.

N2  - The one place that sits outside of the education marketplace is prisons. Characterised by dated technology, a lack of connectivity and poor staffing ratios, prisons are generally not renowned as places of educational innovation. When it does happen, it is all the more remarkable. This chapter describes an innovative educational intervention happening in a prison on the South Island of New Zealand. Learners work on cars, diagnose mechanical issues and deal with workplace safety issues all while improving their numeracy and literacy. What makes this learning unique is that it all takes place in a virtual workshop accessed through virtual reality technology. The cars may not be real, but the learning is. Education is becoming increasingly commodified and significant shifts are occurring in response to changes in the way people work and study. As people seek to upskill to increase their earning potential, qualifications are shifting entirely online to be completed when it is convenient to the learner. Simulations are helping to upskill generations of pilots, engineers and nurses. The need for flexibility in learning and an increasingly crowded marketplace is driving innovation in education, particularly in regard to educational technology. This innovation rarely makes it to the carceral environment, but when it does, the results can be life changing.

N2  - The hypothesis of reducing aggressiveness through transcranial direct current stimulation was recently tested on a cohort of inmates in Spain. The experiment, including 1.5 mA electric shocks, was an external research initiative that received the initial acquiescence of the carceral system. An alarm was raised at the time the research was published, encouraging the directorate of prisons to stop the ongoing replication of the experiment. Nevertheless, no (bio)ethics committee, in the universities or among bioethics experts, has questioned the research. In this think piece, we aim to again discuss some ethical approaches to these clinical interventions on crime. After its positivistic period, the field of criminology has been questioning the simple psychobiological approach to crime because of the reductionistic view of this phenomenon and its harmful consequences. Thus, we address academic experimentation under prison governance and the "re" roles of prisons. We argue that the minor disadvantages of such research, if performed with consent, could be positive if the research can minimize the harmfulness of prison itself; thus, penitentiary treatment and science should go together. Prison administrations, in addition to their duty to protect the individuals under their control from ethically biased research, must promote reintegration. We conclude that human rights are over criminal policy and science and that ethics are over narrower bioethics.

N2  - This chapter draws from feminist technoscience to situate bioinformation within contemporary debates on sexual violence and forensic commissioning. I first discuss the history of mainstream liberal feminism and the development of forensic infrastructure and technologies, contextualising different epistemic and political streams of anti-rape activism. With attention to "rape response" as a carceral logic, I consider the ways in which the sanctity of white cis womanhood is central to its articulation. This chapter then focuses specifically on the two relations of evidence and information, defined as the collection, analysis, retention, and management of bioinformation. By exploring how bodies and persons are rendered and mediated by these material-cultural practices, I make new connections between the intimacy of forensic medical examinations and the emerging data worlds of sexual violence. These data worlds are implicated in the naturalisation and normalisation of racial and sexual violence, whether through investigation, surveillance, or enforcement. In sum, this chapter raises questions about the future of feminist thought in relation to bioinformation studies, illustrating that the concentrations of knowledges surrounding sexual violence invites cross-disciplinary analysis.

Today, amidst the ideological fog of COVID‐19 hysteria, such issues are deafening in their absence. This silence is a harbinger of coming carceral governmentality, long the norm in the spaces of exception that define the frontiers of wealth the world over.

N2  - Should pregnant women be sent to prison? Is prison a place for the birth and care of babies? Can it ever be? This book is the first extensive historical examination of how the modern prison system sought to answer these perennial questions. The book takes the reader through the prison gates to demonstrate that, although a common feature of everyday life in women’s prisons, pregnancy, birth and motherhood were rarely fully considered at policy level. Instead, the experiences of mothers and children were shaped by a myriad of factors including debates about reconciling the management of institutional discipline with the maintenance of health and issues of gender and class. Lamented as an inalienable heritage of woe but also as an opportunity for the closer supervision of mothers, prison births evoked intense debate and required the negotiation of obdurate regimes. The book reveals how oscillating debates about the purpose of prisons shaped the punitive, reformatory and medical treatment of confined mothers. It also challenges scholarly debates about institutional discipline by delving further into the role of prisoners and prison staff in shaping the terms of their incarceration.

N2  - This dissertation explores how technologies and infrastructures for promoting control and cohesion have interfaced with the social and political history of Lesotho over the longue durée. This approach allows for tracing lines of historical continuity and change during a period spanning the coalescing of the nation from communities on the Southern African Highveld in the early-19th century, the onset and grinding realities of British colonial rule and the rise of a local economy dependent on labor migration to South Africa, and the unravelling of empire and the challenges of governance in the years following official national liberation in 1966. I detail how social control strategies over the 19th and 20th centuries interfaced with local and imperial political exigencies, shifts in international penological, biomedical, and scientific racist discourse, and, above all, the responses and forms of knowledge produced by Basotho confronted with coercive technologies and infrastructures. I argue that whereas Highveld technologies disciplined conformity inside of societies, the colonial state introduced prisons and other new punitive technologies as engines for producing social and moral alterity within the politically bounded community. The colonial administration sought to use carceral detention to subjectify and problematize groups of people as embodied threats, on account of their supposedly essential criminality, lunacy, and, for a time, leprosy infectiousness. The motivations for these moves were both ideological and instrumental: in addition to officers wanting to confront conduct which they viewed as problematic in its own right, the creation of the need to control internal problem people(s) served as a basis for shared work with local partners. While shifting punitive regimes did indeed coercively impose a measure of control and open new social fissures, this process never played out precisely as envisioned. In the late colonial era, mounting local and metropolitan pressure led the administration to reverse course: rather than using judicial punishments to simply try to deter crime and stigmatize particular social groups, prison administrators and staff were charged with rehabilitating supposedly maladjusted people for reintegration back into the national community. The Prison Service stuck to this official mission, moreover, even as social tensions and political conflict escalated in the years following independence.

N2  - Many of the essays in this volume describe the ways in which science and technology (“technoscience”) is co-constructed with the carceral imagination. Rusert, for example, shows how the development of certain medical frameworks requiring stabilized populations involved techniques inherited from the antebellum plantation system. Scannell (policing), Poster (labor), and Nopper (credit) all point toward the co-construction of algorithmic technosciences and racialized political economy. But there are cases of the reverse trend as well: convergence between anti-racist activists and their allies in science and engineering fields.

N2  - Clinical trials conducted with incarcerated populations are rare. We present a case example of one such jail-based cancer prevention clinical trial to demonstrate the importance of including a theory-driven approach to intervention framing, novel experimental designs to boost access to low-risk trials, and retention strategies for long-term follow-up of hard-to-reach populations. As such we offer a social determinant of health framework to ensure cancer prevention research is conducted through the lenses of health promotion and health equity. Deviations from the gold-standard randomized control design, transparent systematic allotment, and street-based outreach retention strategies contribute to the feasibility of conducting clinical trials in carceral settings and after people leave jail. Best practices presented can be used in design and conduct of future clinical trials with criminal legal system-involved populations.

N2  - In the spring of 2017, the "Harvard Educational Review" ("HER") published the first part of a symposium on the intersection of incarceration and education. That collection of articles offers scholarly perspectives on the purpose, challenges, and potential of education in carceral settings, as well as the origins and consequences of the carceral system. To continue the conversation, the editors sought out the voices and expertise of those who work at the nexus of education and incarceration. As such, "HER" sought to identify practitioners whose work bridges the two spheres and held interviews with four leaders and innovators in this space. HER editor Simone A. Fried prepared interview questions, and editors Krista Goldstine-Cole, Celia Reddick, and Lauren Yoshizawa conducted the interviews. Each conversation was digitally recorded and later transcribed, then edited and condensed into the narratives presented below. These four interviews illuminate the promise and possibility, as well as the challenge, of educational practice in the context of incarceration and its effects. Jody Becker, the secretary of Washington State Department of Corrections, reflects on the consequences of parental incarceration for children, highlighting the agency's strategic commitment and practical efforts to enhance educational opportunity for both generations. Barbara Carr, Juvenile Court administrator in Jefferson County, Washington, enumerates the growing effects of evidence-based programming in juvenile courts and, in particular, the increasing role for probation counselors as educational advocates for youth in the justice system. Gillian Knapp, a professor of astrophysics and one of the founders of the Prison Teaching Initiative at Princeton University, looks back over eleven years of teaching science and mathematics in New Jersey prisons. By focusing attention on the impact of learning math on educational choice and competence across the curriculum, Knapp reminds us that everyone should receive a decent education. Finally, Luis Giraldo, director of Equity, Diversity, and Cultural Competency at Santa Barbara City College, shares stories from his work at Homeboy Industries. Giraldo pushes us to hear, understand, and respond to the "invisible needs" of previously incarcerated and gang-involved individuals as they transition to being students.

N2  - Over the last two decades, there has been a rapid rise in the proportion of older adults in prisons across the world. While the cause for this trend depends on local demographic, legal and social circumstances, ethnographic attention to this issue remains sparse. This commentary examines the contributions of two recent books on older adults in prisons in order to highlight key questions and findings that might provide a foundation for future research for the anthropology of aging and the life course. Despite focusing on different national contexts, both works reveal the disproportionate harm to older adults as a result of incarceration, as well as the ways individuals cope, even in very restrictive institutional environments. I conclude by stressing the need for more ethnographic attention to the growing overlap between aging and the carceral (in and out of prisons), and the importance of this research for questioning our broader assumptions about aging, care, crime and justice.

N2  - This article contributes to the growing literature bringing together environmental justice (EJ) and abolition, offering the Charles Roundtree Bloom Project in San Antonio, Texas, as a case of abolitionist EJ praxis. I argue that the Bloom Project disrupts capitalist and colonial relations, even if only provisionally, through radical space- and place-making that allow alternative worlds to emerge. "I can't breathe" has been an embodiment and structure of feeling that reflects the historical patterns of policing and pollution across racialized geographies in the United States and connects historical patterns of racial capitalism and colonialism. I suggest that the Bloom Project is a model of how we can move from "I can't breathe" to imagining and growing worlds where we can breathe. By foregrounding the work of the Bloom Project, this article moves away from analyses primarily focused on highlighting the ways that low-income communities of color are toxic and toward the ways that communities are imagining and practicing alternative ways of being, embodying the worlds they desire. I demonstrate how abolitionist EJ praxis contributes to the liberation of carceral geographies and toxic ways of relating to ourselves, each other, and the more-than-human world by providing alternative relationalities based on affirming and sustaining lifeways.

N2  - This article addresses a critical inflection point in the history of the long War on Terror: Israel’s 1992 deportation of over four hundred Palestinians to the “no-man’s-land” between Israel and Lebanon, and the camp that the deportees fashioned for the better part of one year to contest the legitimacy of Israeli colonialism and demand their return. The deportation—meant to incapacitate Islamic militant resistance to the US-brokered peace process between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization—paradoxically provided the conditions of possibility for conversation and collaboration among attorneys, doctors, professors, university students, and imams, which had heretofore been highly restricted and regulated by Israel’s carceral practices in the West Bank and Gaza. The deportees—those who in Giorgio Agamben’s estimation had been literally abandoned in a zone of indistinction—engaged in a political practice of “habitational resistance,” refusing their conversion into
by performing instead a mode of life that rendered multiple lines of transterritorial affiliation, self-assertion, and continuity. The deportees’ published archive—poetry, photobooks, autoethnographies—is understood as a technology of mediation that operates beyond the bounds of the prevailing Islamophobic and orientalist frames while also addressing Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The case of the deportees thus illuminates the articulation of race, religion, and war as it rubs against the linkage between settler colonial dispossession and the Westphalian trinity of nation, state, and territory.

N2  - The problemBarriers to external communication for incarcerated loved ones affect more than 549,100 individuals incarcerated in jail and over 1.2 million incarcerated in prison yearly in the United States. Loved ones, particularly family members, are often forced to pay exorbitant prices for various communication services lest they lose contact with those behind bars. A 2018 report published by FWD.us estimated that 1 in 2 adults has had an immediate family member incarcerated for at least one night. Approximately 1 in 4 US adults have had a sibling incarcerated, 1 in 5 adults experienced parental incarceration, 1 in 7 adults have had an incarcerated spouse or co- parent, and 1 in 8 adults had their child incarcerated.The financial costs of maintaining contact with incarcerated individuals far outstrip what one would pay to communicate with a non- incarcerated person. For example, according to the Prison Policy Initiative's annual prison and jail phone rate surveys, a 15- minute in- state prison phone call in 2021 cost an average of $0.15 to $2.10, depending on the state. Depending on the locality, an in- state phone call from jail costs an average of $0.93 to $5.47 per 15- minute call.Video visitation is a new option for communication, allowing visits to occur from external locations. In some jurisdictions, video visits can take place anywhere with a computer and webcam if scheduled in advance with an approved visitor. The costs can be far higher than phone call rates, with a 30- minute video call costing $9.95 in some jurisdictions. Though there are significant benefits— convenience, improved access to loved ones, and reduced recidivism1— visitors often report that video calls are impersonal, low- quality, and subject to technology problems that may cut visits short.Emails and other electronic messages from carceral facilities permit communication with less scheduling than phone or video calls but still cost money for incarcerated individuals. The Federal Bureau of Prisons operates TRULINCS, or the Trust Fund Limited Inmate Computer System, which incarcerated persons use to send messages for $0.05 per minute spent on the messaging platform. Other privately- operated services, such as J- Pay, offer similar services by purchasing an electronic “stamp” to send their message.

N2  - A high prevalence of homelessness among women with HIV released from incarceration (WHRI) poses significant challenges to antiretroviral therapy. This research examines the pathways through which housing shapes adherence for previously homeless WHRI. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 43 WHRI in a supportive transitional housing program. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Housing triggered subjective and material processes that increased adherence. Subjectively, housing increased empowerment, boosted cognitive and emotional re-engagement with postcarceral life, and established health-seeking behavior norms. Materially, housing increased re integration into community life, reduced exposure to chaos and risk, and increased access to services. Our results suggest how a modified Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework explains adherence by exploring subjective and material facets of TPB. Attitudes were described by subjective re-engagement and material re integration; norms were established through subjective meaning-making and engagement in services; self-efficacy improved through subjective empowerment and reduction in the material risk environment.

N2  - While incarceration has proven detrimental to mental well-being, it remains unknown if community supervision is better for mental well-being than incarceration. Our objective was to explore the individual- and community-level relationships between community supervision and mental well-being and to examine inequities by race. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with individuals on community supervision (e.g., probation, parole) in North Carolina and conducted thematic analysis separately by race. For many, criminal legal involvement began at a young age, often due to substance use for White individuals or over-policing for Black participants. The themes were: (1) “It’s a Thursday. Move on.”: surviving over the life course in the context of the criminal legal system; (2) “Merry go round of death”: the criminal legal system as a trap; (3) “I love you, but I have to love you from over here”: social support as a double-edged sword while on community supervision; and (4) " [Probation] ain’t nothing but a rope to hang yourself”: mental health issues created and exacerbated by criminal legal involvement. Individuals’ experiences on community supervision were often dehumanizing and difficult, preventing them from achieving well-being. This system must be redesigned to meet individual and community needs.
•Individuals lacked agency over their lives, feeling trapped in the carceral system.•Individuals often lacked robust social support to cope with criminal legal adversity.•Probation and parole often create and exacerbate mental health issues.

N2  - In this dissertation, I explore the role of law in policing operations targeting cyber sex offenders in the United States. Specifically, I examine enforcement in this crime arena as part of an ongoing expansion within the carceral, surveillance, risk-based state. I argue that imprecision and lack of clarity within American law – particularly in the evolving world of online interactions – generate hazy, arbitrary applications in law enforcement. On this point, I submit that absence of legal clarity undermines law enforcement efforts to address crimes – both within and beyond the cyber world. Distinctive spaces of online and tech-based socialization, paired with the rapid evolution of technology, produce complex conditions for law enforcement. These components are further nourished – indeed, created – by a pervasive lack of clarity within the law. In short, law is unable to keep pace with the evolving nature of crime, the technologies of crime, and finally, the technologies of crime response, deterrence, and prevention. In chronicling the history of American sex crimes law enforcement broadly and cyber sex crimes specifically, I trace the role of unclear law in the ongoing project of carceral state development. Through my work on a State-mandated taskforce reviewing the Connecticut Sex Offender Registry, I also document impetuses of carceral state construction in the criminal justice apparatus for cataloging, monitoring, tracking, and surveilling of offenders. Moreover, I detect within the shift toward risk-assessment criminal justice sanctions the move to predict and identify not-yet-offenders among the civilian population – a premise of the carceral state drive to subsume the legal into those rendered illegal; the nonpunitive into the punitive; the civil into the penal.

N2  - People of color and other socio-economically marginalized groups in the United States experience a disproportionate burden of environmental challenges such as air pollution and extreme heat; the Environmental Justice (EJ) movement aims to combat these burdens and promote collective well being. Earth Observation (EO) technology, such as satellites, can be used to monitor air quality, extreme heat, and other quantities relevant to EJ. However the application of this technology in measuring EJ, or supporting EJ advocacy efforts has not been widely explored. Satellite EO systems also historically have not been designed with EJ end users in mind. This application is increasingly more pressing as space agencies like NASA are seeking information on how their data can be used to support underserved communities. This dissertation brings together EO data science, systems engineering, and community- engagement to elucidate opportunities and limitations of Earth Observation Technology for Environmental Justice Advocacy. The dissertation is organized into three categories of contributions – Description, Evaluation, and Design/Prescription – that are each composed of multiple research efforts.In Description, I apply a three-pronged approach to provide insights on the opportunities and limitations of EO data for EJ. First, along with a team of researchers, I assess peer- reviewed literature on satellite data for environmental justice through a scoping review. The second contribution of this chapter is an interview study with a subset of grassroots EJ actors about how they can use EO data in their domain of EJ activism which contests the exposure of prisons and incarcerated people to environmental hazards. The third contribution of this chapter is a system’s engineering architectural description of NASA’s current satellite EO for EJ ecosystem. Using justice theory as an analytical framework, I reveal limitations of NASA’s current EO for EJ architecture for advancing holistic notions of EJ.In Evaluation, with support from co-authors, I measure spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution burden, and air and land surface temperature extremes in prison landscapes across the U.S. These studies contribute to a nascent literature documenting empirical evidence of environmental hazards in carceral landscapes. It also extends the literature on applications of satellite-derived and modeled geospatial data for EJ. In Design/Prescription, first, supported by 3 years of community engagement with prison EJ activists, I present the Design of a GIS decision support system that features EO data responding to expressed needs of prison EJ activists. Then, I present two essays that Prescribe recommendations for methodological innovations in the design and application of EO technologies and geospatial data for EJ advocacy.Together, these three chapters demonstrate the immediate relevance of EO and geospatial technologies for prison EJ advocacy, and broader implications for the EO community interested in supporting the aims of the EJ movement more holistically.

N2  - What might it mean to "unsettle" our disciplinary understanding of race, nature, and the environment? In this introduction to the 2023 Special Issue of the Annals of the American Association of Geographers-focused on Race, Nature, and the Environment-we reflect on the meaning and practice of unsettling in a time of climate crisis, toxic legacies, uneven development, state violence, mass extinctions, carceral logics, and racial injustices that shape-and are shaped by-the (re)production of nature. We note the ascendancy of critical scholarship on race and racialization in Anglo-American geography; its uneven diffusion and unmet challenges; and the unstoppable force of insurgent thinking, abolition geography, critical race theory, Black and Indigenous geographies, scholar activism, and environmental justice praxis in taking hold and transforming the discipline. The sixteen articles in this special issue embody different ways to "unsettle" disciplinary thought across the vibrant fields of political ecology and human-environment geography. We discuss how the articles collectively grapple with timely questions of land, water, territory, and place-making; render visible the spatial and socioecological reproduction of power and violence by capital and the state; and make space for the enduring politics of struggle on multiple registers-body, home, classroom, park, city, community, region, and world.

N2  - An interview with Chicago-based Black historian, activist and writer Barbara Ransby in July 2020 as to how to understand the significance of the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) uprisings across the US. Ransby defines the movement and the forces that made George Floyd’s murder a pivotal point for so many people, bringing them on to the streets in over 500 locations. She explains the gestation of the movement against ‘racial capitalism’ from 2012 onwards and its current political formation as made up of an array of forces. The largest most organised coalition is the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). She traces the white Left’s unwillingness to see the Black working class as now the defining point of class politics and addresses issues of police violence, incarceration and white supremacy. Organic solidarity is developing between progressive groups around an abolition agenda, which is simultaneously about dismantling the carceral state and building new institutions.

N2  - In reaction to the 2019 COVID‐19 pandemic, there have been as many as 40 prison uprisings in places as diverse as Italy, Thailand, Iran, Colombia and the USA. With densely populated cell blocks, poorly circulated air, and substandard water and food supplies, prisons are the worst places to be during a pandemic. Moreover, COVID‐19 has proven deadliest for the fastest‐growing incarcerated populations in the Global North: the elderly (Skarupski et al. 2018) and the chronically ill (Udo 2019). As an ethnographer who taught anthropology to prisoners during the US COVID‐19 outbreak, I paid close attention to how understandings of disease, pandemic and quarantine were filtered through the problematic conditions of a carceral state.

N2  - This dissertation draws on three years of ethnographic and archival research to explore the relationship between technology, policing and race at the NYPD. In focusing on the ways problems are constructed and police power enacted, I explore the more-than-human entanglements in the production of race and the governance of cities under racial capitalism. My overarching claim is that urban governance works through contentious techno-political arrangements I call "race-police regimes," which sanction and elicit race by enacting forms of exclusion and belonging. Racial capitalism in New York City, I argue, is governed through a technocratic mode of policing which leverages and entrenches a liberal faith in crime statistics and a common sense regarding the objectivity of crime phenomena and the proper means of upholding social order. Even as it convenes carceral publics across class, race and gender divides, it also underwrites moral panics directed at presumptively criminal anticitizens which are figured archetypically as black. Race-police regimes produce their own justifications and so can remain viable when called into question by protests. Yet they are also riven with antagonism and thus constantly propelled toward rupture and reinvention.

N2  - This book analyzes questions of platform bias, algorithmic filtering and ranking of Internet speech, and declining perceptions of online freedom.
Courts have intervened against unfair platforms in important cases, but they have deferred to private sector decisions in many others, particularly in the United States. The First Amendment, human rights law, competition law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and an array of state and foreign laws address bad faith conduct by Internet platforms or other commercial actors. Arguing that the problem of platform neutrality is similar to the net neutrality problem, the book discusses the assault on freedom of speech that emerges from public-private partnerships. The book draws parallels between U.S. constitutional and statutory doctrines relating to shared spaces and the teachings of international human rights bodies relating to the responsibilities of private actors. It also connects the dots between new rights to appeal account or post removals under the Digital Services Act of the European Union and a variety of fair treatment obligations of platforms under American and European competition laws, "public accommodations" laws, and public utilities laws. Analyzing artificial intelligence (AI) regulation from the point of view of social-media and video-platform users, the book explores overlaps between European and U.S. efforts to limit algorithmic censorship or "shadow-banning."
The book will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of cyberlaw, the law of emerging technologies, and AI law.

N2  - As part of the general 'greening' of prisons in the last decade of neoliberalization and the formation of institutionalized programs to provide science and environmental education opportunities for the incarcerated, the Sustainability in Prisons Project (SPP), a partnership between Evergreen State College and the Washington State Department of Corrections, has become the most vibrant partnership in the US to mesh the cultures and institutions of environmental science and corrections. Drawing attention to the SPP's anchoring mission, which is 'to bring science and nature into prisons,' this article looks at environmental science education in the contemporary prison in light of recent discussions of neoliberal science and ecobiopolitical theory, with the final aim of developing what amounts to a carceral political ecology of environmental education amid an ever expanding neoliberal penal State.

N2  - Since the 1930s, the Gulag system of labour camps was a driving force behind the main geopolitical projects of the Soviet Union, playing a critical role in mega-infrastructural projects to colonise hitherto unexploited territories. Among these was the network of secret cities built at the dawn of the Cold War. Whilst outwardly appearing like ordinary cities - with their green boulevards, central squares, and civic facilities - they were fully controlled and managed by the state; over decades elite scientists and technicians were brought together in these new settlements to work and live in total dedication to the Soviet atomic bomb project. These secret cities were known as Zakrytoye Administrativno-Territorial'noye Obrazovaniye [Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations], abbreviated as ZATOs. The research campuses, production and test zones, and civic and residential districts of the ZATOs were secured with walls, fences, watchtowers, and checkpoints. Beyond the secured perimeters, which still exist to regulate access to and from the outside world, lies the governmental and legislative apparatus which shaped the ZATOs' economic, social, and psychological characteristics. For the inhabitants of ZATOs, the perimeter symbolised their connection to a higher purpose and would later evoke feelings of nostalgia and a sense of protection. Focusing primarily on one of these settlements, namely ZATO Krasnoyarsk-26, this paper links the story of the imprisoned labourers who constructed the ZATOs to that of the civilians who surrendered their liberty for a loftier cause. It will reveal a tight correlation between the Gulag infrastructure and the spatial arrangement of ZATOs showing how, in many aspects, ZATOs took on characteristics of carceral isolation, coercion, and immobility that are still relevant when addressing their contemporary condition.

N2  - The 1946 Bataan Rice Enrichment Project illuminates the intimate connections between Euro-American empire, scientific nationalism, and post-war demonstration in the Philippines. The project was conducted by former American colonial chemist turned philanthropist Robert R. Williams, who sought to prove the efficacy of synthetic-thiamine fortified rice in the fight against beriberi. Yet by willfully exposing half of Bataan's food scarce residents to beriberi, Williams effectively recreated the prisons and asylums that Euro-American researchers had used as living laboratories to induce beriberi in unwilling subjects. These 'carceral laboratories' were highly contested by the people imprisoned within and by nationalist Philippine physicians who understood deficiency disease as a symptom of colonialism. Returning the carceral laboratory to the making of nutritional science explains the post-war Philippine rejection of mandatory rice fortification and is a reminder that the Asian countryside was a creation of colonial modernity and a contested space long before the Cold War.

N2  - The rise of neuroplasticity has led to new fields of study about the relation between social inequalities and neurobiology, including investigations into the “neuroscience of poverty.” The neural phenotype of poverty proposed in recent neuroscientific research emerges out of classed, gendered, and racialized inequalities that not only affect bodies in material ways but also shape scientific understandings of difference. An intersectional, sociomaterial approach is needed to grasp the implications of neuroscientific research that aims to both produce and repair neurobiological difference. Following Benjamin’s critique of the “carceral imagination” of technoscience, this article considers how such research may fix in terms of helping, or in contrast, fix by classifying and reifying, vulnerable subjects. I address the potential for biosocial determinism in linking neural phenotypes and social problems. I use an intersectional approach to consider the presence and absence of race in this body of research and explore how some methodological and conceptual framings of the “brain on poverty” mark poor and minority children for intervention in concert with neoliberal approaches to poverty.

N2  - The 1908 theatrical production The Red Moon is the subject of Peter Raccuglia’s “An American Musical in Red and Black,” which reads the work in the context of the spectacular violence of lynchings and race riots in the early twentieth century. Zooming into the history of Herman Wrice and United Neighbors Against Drugs that led the Black and Latinx movement for community policing of the drug trade, Smith shows how these activists’ engagement with the carceral state ultimately facilitated the “carceral redevelopment” of their neighborhoods. [...]Digitizing the ‘Ideal’ Latina Information Worker,” by Miriam E. Sweeney and Melissa Villa-Nicholas, examines Latina virtual assistants installed at airports along the US southwestern border in the contexts of Latinx labor history and information technology.

N2  - Psychotechne: Assessment, Testing, Categorisation is a two-person
exhibition of works by Sasha Bergstrom-Katz and Tomas Percival. The
artistic research-based projects on view examine how individuals are
assessed through tests, forms, and databases that utilise psychometric
technologies. A variety of institutions—including educational, medical,
and legal systems—utilise such assessments to inform decisions about
the people they manage and use these techniques to categorise and
move individuals. For example, the outcomes of tests can transfer
children into different classrooms based on test-taking abilities;
assessments are used to issue diagnoses which have the power to
change how people are viewed and how they view themselves; and
behavioural and mental health screenings are used to assign categories
of "risk" within carceral and penal systems. The two artworks in this
exhibition focus on particular case studies to explore how assessment,
categorisation, and testing play an active role within institutional
decision-making structures.
Bergstrom-Katz presents one aspect of an ongoing series of works
examining intelligence testing. For this exhibition, she presents On the
Subject of Tests: Test as Archive, a two-sided desk that provides space
for exploration, engagement and interaction with an array of materials
related to intelligence testing. Each desk contains objects from
commonly used intelligence test kits (one desk is organised around the
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the other the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales). Within each desk drawer is an object from
the test kit accompanied by objects, images and articles that directly
connect these test objects to other fields and activities including play,
education, military recruitment, eugenics movements, and psychology.
For this exhibition, Percival developed a new installation emerging
from his ongoing research into systems of assessment within the field
of security. This work investigates the Offender Assessment System
(OASys), a risk assessment tool used within British prisons to assess and
manage incarcerated individuals. The project examines how such digital
tools are used to make decisions about individuals within the prison
estate and the effects of such carceral technologies more broadly.
For this project, Percival is collaborating with previously incarcerated
people to access their OASys files and staging a series of conversations
about the results. The work in this exhibition displays redacted
versions of David’s* file, along with three audio pieces based on their
conversations, which provide a counter-narrative to the dominant
account produced by such punitive technical systems.
Finally, the exhibition connects these two technologies to various
other methods of assessment, including psychological and medical
assessments, by including forms from a variety of settings, many
of which might be familiar. Psychotechne asks what it means for
individuals’ internal lives and outward behaviours to be recorded and
organised, whether by the people themselves or by others. How do
institutions use tests and assessments to categorise people? How do
these assessments affect peoples’ lives?

connect these test objects to other fields and activities including play,
education, military recruitment, eugenics movements, and psychology.
For this exhibition, Percival developed a new installation emerging
from his ongoing research into systems of assessment within the field
of security. This work investigates the Offender Assessment System
(OASys), a risk assessment tool used within British prisons to assess and
manage incarcerated individuals. The project examines how such digital
tools are used to make decisions about individuals within the prison
estate and the effects of such carceral technologies more broadly.
For this project, Percival is collaborating with previously incarcerated
people to access their OASys files and staging a series of conversations
about the results. The work in this exhibition displays redacted
versions of David’s* file, along with three audio pieces based on their
conversations, which provide a counter-narrative to the dominant
account produced by such punitive technical systems.
Finally, the exhibition connects these two technologies to various
other methods of assessment, including psychological and medical
assessments, by including forms from a variety of settings, many
of which might be familiar. Psychotechne asks what it means for
individuals’ internal lives and outward behaviours to be recorded and
organised, whether by the people themselves or by others. How do
institutions use tests and assessments to categorise people? How do
these assessments affect peoples’ lives?

exhibition of works by Sasha Bergstrom-Katz and Tomas Percival. The
artistic research-based projects on view examine how individuals are
assessed through tests, forms, and databases that utilise psychometric
technologies. A variety of institutions—including educational, medical,
and legal systems—utilise such assessments to inform decisions about
the people they manage and use these techniques to categorise and
move individuals. For example, the outcomes of tests can transfer
children into different classrooms based on test-taking abilities;
assessments are used to issue diagnoses which have the power to
change how people are viewed and how they view themselves; and
behavioural and mental health screenings are used to assign categories
of "risk" within carceral and penal systems. The two artworks in this
exhibition focus on particular case studies to explore how assessment,
categorisation, and testing play an active role within institutional
decision-making structures.
Bergstrom-Katz presents one aspect of an ongoing series of works
examining intelligence testing. For this exhibition, she presents On the
Subject of Tests: Test as Archive, a two-sided desk that provides space
for exploration, engagement and interaction with an array of materials
related to intelligence testing. Each desk contains objects from

N2  - This dissertation explores commercial U.S. agriculture as a carceral system. It examines why the spaces that Mexican American/Chicanx migrant farmworkers encounter during their agricultural labor migration are carceral and how these spaces, and migrants’ experiences within them, are represented across media. My carceral framework is influenced by the new directions in prison and abolition studies that do not center on just walls and cages, but understand carcerality as an expansive and malleable concept defined by social relations that result in what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls the “organized abandonment” of specific populations. This dissertation explores the lived experiences of migrant farmworkers through the interdisciplinary analysis of novels, folklore, oral histories, documentary films and digital media, and ethnographic fieldwork at agricultural labor camps. I show through testimonios how the US state and the agriculture industry organize the spaces and social relations of the migrant trail to deny forms of mobility, bodily autonomy, and socio-political power to farmworkers.At stake in applying a carceral framework to farmworker studies is understanding how agribusiness has long been a central part of carceral capitalism. Furthermore, it shows that farmworkers and their efforts to abolish the current agricultural system need to be recognized as integral components of the broader abolitionist movement due to the deep interconnection of their experiences with those living in other carceral spaces. The consequences of this analysis extend far beyond the fields, revealing an extended abolitionist collectivity that includes migrant farmworkers and people incarcerated across the country, including those in agricultural labor camps, prison plantations, and ICE detention centers.

N2  - In Virtual Pedophilia Gillian Harkins traces how by the end of the twentieth century the pedophile as a social outcast evolved into its contemporary appearance as a virtually normal white male. The pedophile's alleged racial and gender normativity was treated as an exception to dominant racialized modes of criminal or diagnostic profiling. The pedophile was instead profiled as a virtual figure, a potential threat made visible only when information was transformed into predictive image. The virtual pedophile was everywhere and nowhere, slipping through day-to-day life undetected until people learned how to arm themselves with the right combination of visually predictive information. Drawing on television, movies, and documentaries such as Law and Order: SVU, To Catch a Predator, Mystic River, and Capturing the Friedmans, Harkins shows how diverse U.S. audiences have been conscripted and trained to be lay detectives who should always be on the lookout for the pedophile as virtual predator. In this way, the perceived threat of the pedophile legitimated increased surveillance and ramped-up legal strictures that expanded the security apparatus of the carceral state.

N2  - Leigh Goodmark's work on domestic violence argues for alternatives to criminal justice to 'solve' issues of gendered violence. The criminalisation of sex work and prostitution is rarely discussed in this context-a rather odd omission given the increasing trend towards 'criminalising demand' and counter-calls for decriminalisation in this domain. In this article, we bring the two debates into conversation, using Goodmark's work to bring analytical clarity to the prostitution debate and connect sex work to wider social justice debates in feminist anti-violence circles. We aim to move the conversation beyond retribution and the view that law is justice to outline a vision of justice for sex workers grounded in the principles of rights, recognition and representation. By contextualising the decriminalisation of prostitution within the framework of a wider anti-carceral justice movement, we seek to build alliances for social justice that transcend the current divide.

N2  - Drug-use surveillance systems appear in this paper as symptomatic “technologies of suspicion” that constitute a set of empirical modes for producing and interpreting “data” or test results in ways that conflate prediction with prescription, acting as technological forms of supervision, monitoring, supposed deterrence, and ultimately control. Technologies of suspicion are predicated upon a framework of trust; they are deployed within a “system of takings-for-granted” that presupposes trust and thus makes distrust possible. Drug-testing provides an excellent example of the institutionalization of distrust through the deployment of technologies of suspicion not only within institutions but beyond their real and virtual walls. The paper considers the also considers the decentralization and deinstitutionalization of distrust, the capillary dispersion of suspicion throughout the carceral society, and the role of distrust in underwriting the development of certain kinds of knowledge systems and technologies, forms of social and cognitive order, and the functional dispersion of police practices to individuals such as parents, teachers, and peers. Studying why bio-surveillance modalities should diffuse despite their unreliability and their contribution to a generalized climate of suspicion enables the characterization of certain features of the post-sovereign subject in a post-disciplinary regime.

N2  - TOPIC/PROBLEM:  Since 1978, the federal inmates of Canada serving time have had access to a full range of psychiatric care within the carceral system. Five psychiatric units are part of the Federal Correctional Services. Nursing practice in forensic psychiatry opens up new horizons in nursing. This complex professional nursing practice involves the coupling of two contradictory socio‐professional mandates: to punish and to provide care.
METHOD:  The purpose of this article is to present the results of a grounded theory doctoral study realized in a multi‐level security psychiatric ward of the Canadian Federal Penitentiary System. The theoretical work of the late French philosopher, Michel Foucault, and those of sociologist, Erving Goffman, are used to illuminate the qualitative data that emerged from the author's fieldwork.
FINDINGS:  A Foucauldian perspective allows us to understand the way forensic psychiatric nursing is involved in the governance of mentally ill criminals through a vast array of power techniques (sovereign, disciplinary, and pastoral) which posited nurses as “subjects of power”. These nurses are also “objects of power” in that nursing practice is constrained by formal and informal regulations of the penitentiary context.
CONCLUSION:  As an object of “governmental technologies”, the nursing staff becomes the body onto which a process of conforming to the customs of the correctional milieu is dictated and inscribed. The results of this qualitative research, from a nursing perspective, are the first of their kind to be reported in Canada since the creation of the Regional Psychiatric Correctional Units in 1978.

N2  - Criminalization is the primary societal response to intimate partner violence in the US. This reliance on criminal legal system interventions ignores several unintended consequences. One of the serious unintended consequences of criminalization - perhaps the most serious unintended consequence - has been the increased rates of arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration of those whom criminalization was meant to protect: victims of intimate partner violence. Criminalized survivors follow a variety of pathways into the carceral system, which fails to recognize their status as victims of violence and punishes them for failure to conform to victim stereotypes as well as for their acts.

N2  - This ethnographic Essay critiques progressive criminal justice reforms as neoliberal technologies that devalue racialized labor within the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. It begins by describing the emergent "reentry space," a proliferating network of policy and programming emerging to manage and provide services for formerly incarcerated people returning to the city. Reentry is framed as a way to reinvest state and city resources and is also explicitly described as a project toward racial equality through decarceration.

N2  - Background: This research aimed to provide young people in a juvenile rehabilitation centre (JRC) with access and exposure to virtual reality (VR) as a growing media technology industry, to offer media education that was fun and engaging, and to introduce the digital arts to participants as a potential career path. The project evolved through a partnership with the Washington State Librarian who, as a part of her role overseeing public library activities, wanted to ensure that newly acquired VR equipment was made available to as many people as possible. This effort included libraries within sites of incarceration.
Analysis: This article presents a reflective and analytical discussion on the success and challenges of creating, implementing, and researching a VR art design program in a JRC.
Conclusions and Implications: Carceral logics are entangled in research and education, in constant tension with anti-oppressive methods in place. Improvisational action as a design method in media education programs, including VR art design with incarcerated youth, may support greater participation and stronger research outcomes.

N2  - This chapter responds to the recent crisis surrounding developments in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI with a relational view of education informed by the emerging world‐centered approach to education and a synthesis of personalist character formation with feminist care ethics. It proposes that the instinct to manage student use of generative AI with carceral practices, characterized by surveillance and control, undermines the project of forming students as whole persons who can evaluate and use or reject emerging technologies in a mature way. The chapter concludes with practical suggestions for the classroom that can be aligned with institutional strategic plans.

N2  - BackgroundMillions of Americans remain infected with hepatitis C (HCV). Innovation in care delivery is required to achieve the goal of national elimination.AimDevelop a low-threshold HCV treatment program.SettingFree clinic with mobile unit providing transitional care to people leaving jails and prisons across Alabama.ParticipantsFormerly incarcerated persons, many of whom are uninsured and live in rural areas.Program DescriptionWe utilized point-of-care diagnostics to condense the HCV screening and pre-treatment evaluation into a single encounter. Patient assistance programs were used to obtain medications for uninsured patients. Clinical support was provided through in-person and telehealth care.Program EvaluationFrom January 2023 to December 2024, 369 patients were screened for HCV; 104 (28.1%) were HCV antibody positive, and 71 (19.2%) were viremic. Of these patients, 70 completed pre-treatment diagnostics, 54 started treatment, 41 confirmed completion, 20 had SVR12 collected, with 19 achieving cure (94% cure rate). The median time from diagnosis to treatment initiation was 27 days.DiscussionIt is possible to both diagnose HCV and complete the entire pre-treatment evaluation in a single encounter and initiate treatment within 1 month, even for predominantly uninsured populations in rural areas.

N2  - This is a history of Black women’s experiences within, around, and outside of the perimeters of the southern carceral regime. Through an expansive case study of Alabama through the post-World War I moment, the interwar years, the Great Depression, Great Migration, the New Deal, and the infrastructural modernization in the post-World War II moment, this dissertation examines the relationship that carcerality forged between space and time. From penitentiaries, penal camps, and jails, incarcerated Black women challenged the boundaries of carcerality in the rural and urban South. In response, the state ritualized recapture as a mode of epistemological, ontological, and genealogical violence. This dissertation traces how Black women’s fugitive movements reflected and responded to these spatial and temporal vulnerabilities.Through its consideration of spatiality, this twentieth-century history of carceral fugitivity deepens the rich body of scholarship by Black activists and scholars that articulate the relationship between slavery and carcerality. This dissertation contends that by attending to the histories of escape in the aftermath of slavery enriches our understanding of how specific technologies of surveillance—in tandem with coerced labor—were direct responses to incarcerated Black women’s attempts to dismantle the prison’s spatial domination by stealing themselves away from its boundaries. In this way, Black women’s escape exposes that at the nexus of the prison there was a profound entanglement of past and future. Tracing both literal escapes and fugitive practices from within the prison delineates how the concrete relationship between slavery and prisons was co-constitutive with the future implementations, designs, and configurations of carcerality by century’s end. In other words, it was not just the recursive use of specific technologies of violence that survived the abolition of slavery, but its very logic of spatial domination that conditioned twentieth-century responses to Black fugitivity. “Unable to Find Any Trace of Her” is about movement, a shifting relationship between people and space. The criminalized and surveilled movement of Black women as well as the movement of carceral violence out from behind prison walls. Both offer critical narratives about the temporality of the southern carceral regime: as a racialized project steeped in violences that survived the abolition of slavery and as an anticipatory model of late-twentieth century carceral expansion under neoliberalism.

N2  - Background: Despite existing international standards for the prison management of incarcerated trans people, carceral policies across Australian jurisdictions vary in their availability, breadth, and appropriateness. Trans populations in prison represent a vulnerable population, having specific needs surrounding their health, safety, and wellbeing. Prior reviews into Australian carceral policies highlight where contemporary prison practices fall short of meeting those specific needs.Aims/method: A review was conducted on the available carceral policy documents of each Australian correctional service regime, examining their coverage of issues including healthcare access, placement decisions, and classification systems against international standards and prior Australian recommendations. Forty-one relevant policy documents were reviewed against eighteen benchmark recommendations, along with .Results: Australian jurisdictions varied widely on the coverage of the reviewed areas. Benchmark attainment ranged from twelve out of eighteen (Victoria and Western Australia) to three out of eighteen (Queensland). The use of administrative segregation was identified as the area in most need of policy reform. No jurisdiction met every benchmark.Conclusions: This review highlights the need for carceral policy reform across Australian jurisdictions in order to meet the unique needs of incarcerated trans people, especially in the areas of administrative segregation and healthcare access. The review also highlights the need for carceral policy reform to bring Australian jurisdictions in line with each other on the management of incarcerated trans people, to reduce disparate outcomes across states and territories.

N2  - The rate of female incarceration continues to surge, resulting in over 714,000 women currently being held behind bars worldwide. Females generally enter carceral facilities with low educational profiles, and educational programming inside is rarely a high priority. Access to education is a proven contributor to women's social and economic empowerment and can minimise some of the obstacles they encounter after being released from custody. Support for the intellectual potential of incarcerated female 'students' can address intersecting inequalities that impede access to social protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure. Policymakers, academics and activists concerned with gender equality must begin by focusing on academic and vocational program development for female prisoners, built through strong community partnerships, and inclusive of trauma informed supports.

N2  - Summary Background Self-harm and suicide are common in prisoners, yet robust information on the full extent and characteristics of people at risk of self-harm is scant. Furthermore, understanding how frequently self-harm is followed by suicide, and in which prisoners this progression is most likely to happen, is important. We did a case-control study of all prisoners in England and Wales to ascertain the prevalence of self-harm in this population, associated risk factors, clustering effects, and risk of subsequent suicide after self-harm. Methods Records of self-harm incidents in all prisons in England and Wales were gathered routinely between January, 2004, and December, 2009. We did a case-control comparison of prisoners who self-harmed and those who did not between January, 2006, and December, 2009. We also used a Bayesian approach to look at clustering of people who self-harmed. Prisoners who self-harmed and subsequently died by suicide in prison were compared with other inmates who self-harmed. Findings 139 195 self-harm incidents were recorded in 26 510 individual prisoners between 2004 and 2009; 5–6% of male prisoners and 20–24% of female inmates self-harmed every year. Self-harm rates were more than ten times higher in female prisoners than in male inmates. Repetition of self-harm was common, particularly in women and teenage girls, in whom a subgroup of 102 prisoners accounted for 17 307 episodes. In both sexes, self-harm was associated with younger age, white ethnic origin, prison type, and a life sentence or being unsentenced; in female inmates, committing a violent offence against an individual was also a factor. Substantial evidence was noted of clustering in time and location of prisoners who self-harmed (adjusted intra-class correlation 0·15, 95% CI 0·11–0·18). 109 subsequent suicides in prison were reported in individuals who self-harmed; the risk was higher in those who self-harmed than in the general prison population, and more than half the deaths occurred within a month of self-harm. Risk factors for suicide after self-harm in male prisoners were older age and a previous self-harm incident of high or moderate lethality; in female inmates, a history of more than five self-harm incidents within a year was associated with subsequent suicide. Interpretation The burden of self-harm in prisoners is substantial, particularly in women. Self-harm in prison is associated with subsequent suicide in this setting. Prevention and treatment of self-harm in prisoners is an essential component of suicide prevention in prisons.

N2  - Aims
Release from prison is a high‐risk period for mortality. We examined the impact of opioid substitution therapy (OST), for opioid dependence during and after incarceration, upon mortality post‐release.
Design
A cohort was formed of all opioid‐dependent people who entered OST between 1985 and 2010 and who, following first OST entry, were released from prison at least once between 2000 and 2012. We linked data on OST history, court and prison records and deaths.
Setting
New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
Participants
A total of 16 453 people released from prison 60 161 times.
Measurements
Crude mortality rates (CMRs) were calculated according to OST retention; multivariable Cox regressions for post‐release periods were undertaken to examine the association between OST exposure (a time‐dependent variable) and mortality post‐release, for which covariates were updated per‐release.
Findings
There were 100 978 person‐years (PY) post‐release; 1050 deaths occurred. Most received OST while incarcerated (76.5%); individuals were receiving OST in 51% of releases. Lowest post‐release mortality was among those continuously retained in OST post‐release CMR 4 weeks post‐release = 6.4 per 1000 PY; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.2, 7.8, highest among those with no OST (CMR = 36.7 per 1000 PY; 95% CI = 28.8, 45.9). Multi‐factorial models showed OST exposure in the 4 weeks post‐release reduced hazard of death by 75% (adjusted hazard ratio 0.25; 95% CI = 0.12, 0.53); OST receipt in prison had a short‐term protective effect that decayed quickly across time.
Conclusion
In New South Wales, Australia, opioid substitution therapy in prison and post‐release appears to reduce mortality risk in the immediate post‐release period.

N2  - Cities matter. They are often the sites in which the helping hand and the clenched fist of the state makes first contact with the citizen. They are engines of national economic growth and, often, the source of political movements that become national and transnational in scope. Yet, the theoretical tools available to study change at the urban level are limited. This article seeks to address this shortcoming by offering a new account of urban political development. I argue that urban political development is driven by the impact of multiple political orders. My aim is to highlight three apparently contradictory patterns of urban political development: the imposition of urban austerity measures, the rise of the urban carceral state, and the emergence of progressive economic policymaking, such as local minimum wage ordinances. I suggest that these shifts reflect underlying operation and competition among neoliberal, conservative and egalitarian political orders respectively.

N2  - Geographers have been central to identifying and exploring the shifting spatialities of border enforcement and how different enforcement strategies alter the geography of state sovereignty. Migration-related public information campaigns (PICs) are one strategy that has received increasing attention from geographers and social scientists more broadly in recent years. Although existing research examines the sites and spaces where PICs are distributed, as well as the affective content of their messaging, little research has examined the development of campaigns and the transnational connections that enable their deployment. This article draws on work in the fields of carceral circuitry and transnational enforcement networks to expand our understanding of affective governmentality as a transnational strategy of border governance. Based on data collected as part of a large-scale comparative study of the use of PICs by the U.S. and Australian governments, we argue that this form of affective governmentality relies on transnational circuits through which people, money, and knowledge move to enable the development and circulation of affective messaging. In doing so, we develop the concept of transnational affective circuitry to refer to the often contingent, temporary relations and connections that enable PICs to operate as a form of transnational affective governmentality aimed at hindering unauthorized migration. Our analysis illustrates the transnational connections that enable increasingly expansive and creative forms of border enforcement to emerge while also expanding the scope of examinations of affective governmentality to attend to the relations that undergird and enable this form of transnational governance.

N2  - An unprecedented number of Americans have been incarcerated in the past generation. In addition, arrests are concentrated in low-income, predominantly nonwhite communities where people are more likely to be medically underserved. As a result, rates of physical and mental illnesses are far higher among prison and jail inmates than among the general public. We review the health profiles of the incarcerated; health care in correctional facilities; and incarceration's repercussions for public health in the communities to which inmates return upon release. The review concludes with recommendations that public health and medical practitioners capitalize on the public health opportunities provided by correctional settings to reach medically underserved communities, while simultaneously advocating for fundamental system change to reduce unnecessary incarceration.

N2  - The paper considers Leros in the Greek Dodecanese as a case study in the history of rationalist architecture of the fascist Italian regime, implicating varied forms of surveillance, exile, detainment, and incarceration. The paper explores the enduring legacy and impact the colonial and military architecture, policy, and planning have had on urban and architectural forms, local labour economies, and the community that continues to the present day. The research spans from the Italian occupation of Leros to the establishment of detention centres for refugees today, following the chronologically overlapping trans-institutional transformation of Italian military and medical infrastructures into notorious mental health care facilities and camps for political prisoners and violently displaced children from mainland Greece. The paper focuses on the relationships established by the plan, the architecture, the strict imposition of gerarchia [hierarchy], as defined elsewhere by Diane Ghirardo, and associated governing frameworks, which established a unique urban form and social fabric. The paper explores not only the aesthetic and formal qualities of the architectural object but also the socio-political diagram embedded in the logic of the ambitious building programme of the Italian occupation. It will further examine the spatial tactics and policies that supported Italian control and, consequently, the gradual erosion of agrarian traditions and capabilities of the local population, forcing them into a complex co-dependence. It is precisely the interdependence and co-existence of architecture and labour that perpetuates the island's role as an apparatus of control, creating a carceral campus of surveillance and exile.

N2  - IMPORTANCE A marked lack of empathy is a hallmark characteristic of individuals with psychopathy. However, neural processes associated with empathic processing have not yet been directly examined in psychopathy, especially in response to the perception of other people in pain and distress. OBJECTIVE To identify potential differences in patterns of neural activity in incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated persons serving as controls during the perception of empathy-eliciting stimuli depicting other people experiencing pain. DESIGN In a case-control study, brain activation patterns elicited by dynamic stimuli depicting individuals being harmed and facial expressions of pain were compared between incarcerated individuals with psychopathy and incarcerated controls. SETTING Participants were scanned on the grounds of a correctional facility using the Mind Research Network's mobile 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging system. PARTICIPANTS Eighty incarcerated men were classified according to scores on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R) as high (27 men; PCL-R, ≥30), intermediate (28 men; PCL-R, 21-29), or low (25 men; PCL-R, ≤20) levels of psychopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Neurohemodynamic response to empathy-eliciting dynamic scenarios revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Participants in the psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and periaqueductal gray relative to controls but showed greater activation in the insula, which was positively correlated with scores on both PCL-R factors 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In response to pain and distress cues expressed by others, individuals with psychopathy exhibit deficits in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex regardless of stimulus type and display selective impairment in processing facial cues of distress in regions associated with cognitive mentalizing. A better understanding of the neural responses to empathy-eliciting stimuli in psychopathy is necessary to inform intervention programs.

N2  - Mohapatra and Kuo said that data-driven technology usage abounds in policing and incarceration: biometric surveillance, facial recognition software, ShotSpotter, license plate readers, cell tower simulators ("Stingrays"), drones, metadatabases, and myriad predictive technologies. Ongoing protests against police violence and mass incarceration have created an urgent push to challenge and dismantle policing, including the carceral tools and surveillance technologies utilized by law enforcement, and also increased widespread public interest in defunding the police. Despite claiming to meet the anti-carceral demands of the moment, these research ventures legitimize law enforcement bureaucracy as capable of solving police violence, while facilitating police presence within radical milieus of abolitionist dissent. Intellectual and political frameworks that take law enforcement as the site of change through "reimagining police" or discussing "futures of policing" facilitate the institutional capture of abolitionist dissent, entrenching impermissible reforms as "abolitionist" without actually providing strategies to end police violence and that of the prison industrial complex. These forms of research often are enthusiastically adopted into contemporary political discourse seeking the development and improvement of policing.

N2  - Background:Despite growing inmate populations in the USA, inmates are excluded from most national health surveys and little is known about whether the prevalence of chronic disease differs between inmates and the non-institutionalised population.Methods:Nationally representative, cross-sectional data from the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities and 2002–4 National Health Interview Survey Sample Adult Files on individuals aged 18–65 were used. Binary and multinomial logistic regression were used to compare the prevalence of self-reported chronic medical conditions among jail (n = 6582) and prison (n = 14 373) inmates and non-institutionalised (n = 76 597) adults after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, employment, the USA as birthplace, marital status and alcohol consumption. Prevalence and adjusted ORs with 95% CIs were calculated for nine important chronic conditions.Results:Compared with the general population, jail and prison inmates had higher odds of hypertension (ORjail 1.19; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.31; ORprison 1.17; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.27), asthma (ORjail 1.41; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.56; ORprison 1.34; 95% CI 1.22 to 1.46), arthritis (ORjail 1.65; 95% CI 1.47 to 1.84; ORprison 1.66; 95% CI 1.54 to 1.80), cervical cancer (ORjail 4.16; 95% CI 3.13 to 5.53; ORprison 4.82; 95% CI 3.74 to 6.22), and hepatitis (ORjail 2.57; 95% CI 2.20 to 3.00; ORprison 4.23; 95% CI 3.71 to 4.82), but no increased odds of diabetes, angina or myocardial infarction, and lower odds of obesity.Conclusions:Jail and prison inmates had a higher burden of most chronic medical conditions than the general population even with adjustment for important sociodemographic differences and alcohol consumption.

N2  - This article provides a cultural history of film and television at Louisiana's Angola Prison in the 1950s to show that moving images coexisted with the brutalities for which the prison is known, including stark labor conditions, corporal violence, and punitive racism. Despite their promotion as improvements during an era of reform, the technologies of film and television accommodated the prison's repressive hierarchies of race, gender, and labor. By analyzing the penitentiary's newspaper, the Angolite, alongside its peer publications at other prisons, I show that prison newspapers played a significant role in promoting film exhibition in carceral spaces.

N2  - BACKGROUND—Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.
METHODS AND RESULTS—Human fetal and neonatal rat lungs contain ECFCs with robust proliferative potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. In contrast, human fetal lung ECFCs exposed to hyperoxia in vitro and neonatal rat ECFCs isolated from hyperoxic alveolar growth–arrested rat lungs mimicking bronchopulmonary dysplasia proliferated less, showed decreased clonogenic capacity, and formed fewer capillary-like networks. Intrajugular administration of human cord blood–derived ECFCs after established arrested alveolar growth restored lung function, alveolar and lung vascular growth, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. Lung ECFC colony- and capillary-like network-forming capabilities were also restored. Low ECFC engraftment and the protective effect of cell-free ECFC-derived conditioned media suggest a paracrine effect. Long-term (10 months) assessment of ECFC therapy showed no adverse effects with persistent improvement in lung structure, exercise capacity, and pulmonary hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS—Impaired ECFC function may contribute to arrested alveolar growth. Cord blood–derived ECFC therapy may offer new therapeutic options for lung diseases characterized by alveolar damage.

N2  - Obtaining the health status of incarcerated individuals and facility staff and comparing that with the combined environmental samples from both groups can provide a more comprehensive view. The findings by Kennedy et al.-that WBS can be used across a range of facilities (i.e., cells vs dorms) and wastewater sample types (i.e., Moore swab or grab sample)-are consistent with those of the Water Environment Federation6 Because of differences in detention duration, the sampling design in jails may require more frequent wastewater testing than that in prisons. [...]once a jail or prison is set up for WBS, it is not automated and requires continual labor-intensive facility sampling and laboratory services. Key health policy recommendations on the utility of WBS in prisons and jails for the protection of incarcerated individuals during the next outbreak include the following: * Approach WBS sampling design and data use in prisons versus jails differently. * Use WBS data as complementary information; clinical case data are still required. * Target wastewater testing where the disease can be clinically managed to limit facility spread. * Have high confidence in negative wastewater concentration to guide less comprehensive individual testing protocols. * Consider WBS across a range of facilities, sampling types, and laboratory analysis models. * Plan periodic sampling design adjustments. * View future carcéral facility sewer infrastructure and health investment jointly.

N2  - Social care detention is transgressive. The Cheshire West acid test collapsed the imaginary boundary line bisecting the landscape of the law of institutions, extending regulatory structures developed to manage the threat of institutionalized carceral care into the spheres of home, family and ‘community’. This signals trouble for post-carceral ideology, which identifies homes and community as sites of freedom. Whatever liberty is now, its locus cannot be neatly drawn on a map, but rather requires a careful unpicking of relational-spatial micro-dynamics of power across diverse and dispersed care arrangements. Cheshire West is a powerful sign of a system in crisis, of unsustainable pressures and tensions within the post-carceral landscape of care. On one reading, Cheshire West is a victorious story of human rights, finally recognizing the legal personhood of populations too long consigned to a legal netherworld of ‘informality’. Another telling of Cheshire West is a tale of tragedy, of a lost future horizon free of the carceral institution, of a journey back into our carceral past. There are now more people deprived of their liberty in Britain’s care homes than its prisons, or any other paradigmatic carceral site (Series, 2019).

N2  - Acoustic gunshot detection systems (AGDS) have been emerging as a technological solution to the growing problem of gun violence around the world. We examine a particularly prominent AGDS technology called RespondTM developed by publicly traded US company ShotSpotter Inc. (NASDAQ: SSTI) to better understand the sociotechnical logics that inform its operation. Drawing from frameworks provided by science and technology studies and sound studies, we ask, “What are the broader conditions that allow for a successful AGDS as it is imagined by ShotSpotter?” At a time in which the accuracy and reliability of ShotSpotter’s AGDS are being seriously questioned through the numerous reports of false positives that reached as high as 99 percent in certain cities it was deployed in, it is imperative to interrogate what exactly is “false” in these false positive reports and how the company operates despite them. In this paper, we trace ShotSpotter and its artificial intelligence/machine learning AGDS technologies as they exist across various patents, promotional materials, financial documents, and public statements to not only better understand the ways in which they translate sound into “crime,” or space into “crime scene,” but also to bring attention to how ShotSpotter translates itself across its different audiences.

N2  - Objectives. We assessed mental health screening and medication continuity in a nationally representative sample of US prisoners.
Methods. We obtained data from 18 185 prisoners interviewed in the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. We conducted survey logistic regressions with Stata version 13.
Results. About 26% of the inmates were diagnosed with a mental health condition at some point during their lifetime, and a very small proportion (18%) were taking medication for their condition(s) on admission to prison. In prison, more than 50% of those who were medicated for mental health conditions at admission did not receive pharmacotherapy in prison. Inmates with schizophrenia were most likely to receive pharmacotherapy compared with those presenting with less overt conditions (e.g., depression). This lack of treatment continuity is partially attributable to screening procedures that do not result in treatment by a medical professional in prison.
Conclusions. A substantial portion of the prison population is not receiving treatment for mental health conditions. This treatment discontinuity has the potential to affect both recidivism and health care costs on release from prison.

N2  - Background: Among former prisoners, a high rate of death has been documented in the early postrelease period, particularly from drug-related causes. Little is known about risk factors and trends in postrelease mortality in the past decade, especially given general population increases in overdose deaths from pharmaceutical opioids.
Objective: To determine postrelease mortality between 1999 and 2009; cause-specific mortality rates; and whether sex, calendar year, and custody factors were risk factors for all-cause, overdose, and opioid-related deaths.
Design: Cohort study.
Setting: Prison system of the Washington State Department of Corrections.
Participants: 76 208 persons released from prison.
Measurements: Identities were linked probabilistically to the National Death Index to identify deaths and causes of death, and mortality rates were calculated. Cox proportional hazards regression estimated the effect of age, sex, race or ethnicity, whether the incarceration resulted from a violation of terms of the person's community supervision, length of incarceration, release type, and calendar year on the hazard ratio (HR) for death.
Results: The all-cause mortality rate was 737 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 708 to 766) (n = 2462 deaths). Opioids were involved in 14.8% of all deaths. Overdose was the leading cause of death (167 per 100 000 person-years [CI, 153 to 181]), and overdose deaths in former prisoners accounted for 8.3% of the overdose deaths among persons aged 15 to 84 years in Washington from 2000 to 2009. Women were at increased risk for overdose (HR, 1.38 [CI, 1.12 to 1.69]) and opioid-related deaths (HR, 1.39 [CI, 1.09 to 179]).
Limitation: The study was done in only 1 state.
Conclusion: Innovation is needed to reduce the risk for overdose among former prisoners.

N2  - Objective:
A number of legal, social, and political factors over the past 40 years have led to the current epidemic of psychiatric disorders in the U.S. prison system. Although numerous investigations have reported substantially elevated rates of psychiatric disorders among prison inmates compared with the general population, it is unclear whether mental illness is a risk factor for multiple episodes of incarceration. The authors examined this association in a retrospective cohort study of the nation's largest state prison system.
Method:
The study population included 79,211 inmates who began serving a sentence between September 1, 2006, and August 31, 2007. Data on psychiatric disorders, demographic characteristics, and history of incarceration for the preceding 6-year period were obtained from statewide medical information systems and analyzed.
Results:
Inmates with major psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and nonschizophrenic psychotic disorders) had substantially increased risks of multiple incarcerations over the 6-year study period. The greatest increase in risk was observed among inmates with bipolar disorders, who were 3.3 times more likely to have had four or more previous incarcerations compared with inmates who had no major psychiatric disorder.
Conclusions:
Prison inmates with major psychiatric disorders are more likely than those without to have had previous incarcerations. The authors recommend expanding interventions to reduce recidivism among mentally ill inmates. They discuss the potential benefits of continuity of care reentry programs to help mentally ill inmates connect with community-based mental health programs at the time of their release, as well as a greater role for mental health courts and other diversion strategies.

N2  - The Routledge Companion to the Literature of the U.S. South provides a collection of vibrant and multidisciplinary essays by scholars from a wide range of backgrounds working in the field of U.S. southern literary studies. With topics ranging from American studies, African American studies, transatlantic or global studies, multiethnic studies, immigration studies, and gender studies, this volume presents a multi-faceted conversation around a wide variety of subjects in U.S. southern literary studies. The Companion will offer a comprehensive overview of the southern literary studies field, including a chronological history from the U.S. colonial era to the present day and theoretical touchstones, while also introducing new methods of reconceiving region and the U.S. South as inherently interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional. The volume will therefore be an invaluable tool for instructors, scholars, students, and members of the general public who are interested in exploring the field further but will also suggest new methods of engaging with regional studies, American studies, American literary studies, and cultural studies.

N2  - Materially and symbolically manifest, borders are shaped by history, politics and power. This second special issue of a two-part series brings together an international collective of authors who presented their papers at a conference on Technologies of Bordering convened by the editors at the University of Melbourne, Australia in July 2019. We invited presentations that critically engage with multiple and varied forms of bordering as expressions of power and oppression, as well as those that considered the possibilities and aspirations for more hopeful and progressive futures. Articles explored a range of issues from borders within and beyond detention centres and carceral systems to colonial and postcolonial forms of bordering. Drawing on a variety of empirical research across different spaces and scales, a range of theoretical perspectives and a diversity of methodological approaches, the articles collectively address the material, digital, virtual and human technologies that divide, exclude, contain, control and govern humans and non-humans.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  The transition from prison back into the community is particularly hazardous for drug‐using offenders whose tolerance for heroin has been reduced by imprisonment. Studies have indicated an increased risk of drug‐related death soon after release from prison, particularly in the first 2 weeks. For precise, up‐to‐date understanding of these risks, a meta‐analysis was conducted on the risk of drug‐related death in weeks 1 + 2 and 3 + 4 compared with later 2‐week periods in the first 12 weeks after release from prison.
Methods  English‐language studies were identified that followed up adult prisoners for mortality from time of index release for at least 12 weeks. Six studies from six prison systems met the inclusion criteria and relevant data were extracted independently.
Results  These studies contributed a total of 69 093 person‐years and 1033 deaths in the first 12 weeks after release, of which 612 were drug‐related. A three‐ to eightfold increased risk of drug‐related death was found when comparing weeks 1 + 2 with weeks 3–12, with notable heterogeneity between countries: United Kingdom, 7.5 (95% CI: 5.7–9.9); Australia, 4.0 (95% CI: 3.4–4.8); Washington State, USA, 8.4 (95% CI: 5.0–14.2) and New Mexico State, USA, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.3–7.1). Comparing weeks 3 + 4 with weeks 5–12, the pooled relative risk was: 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3–2.2).
Conclusions  These findings confirm that there is an increased risk of drug‐related death during the first 2 weeks after release from prison and that the risk remains elevated up to at least the fourth week.

N2  - Forecast to become a US$122 billion industry by 2024, the business of sexual
wellness is on the rise. However, in an age of surveillance capitalism,
where user data are extracted and monetised at scale, there remain real
risks for marginalised, stigmatised and criminalised communities. This
chapter reviews key concepts from the literature on sex tech, sexual rights
and ethical governance to explore how sex tech can be used to enhance rather
than hinder access to sexual health, rights and justice. It suggests three
fundamental lenses through which to consider the politics of sex tech -
design, data and governance. These frameworks allow us to consider how human
values influence technologies, how sexual data are valued and whose
interests are prioritised in tech deployment. The chapter critiques what I
describe as 'carceral sex tech,' a form of biopolitical management whereby
private and state actors police, restrict, surveil, and control sexual
cultures in ways that reinforce systems of oppression. It concludes by
calling for counter-surveillance sex tech and asking how the benefits of
this billion-dollar industry can be more equitably distributed, how the
socio-political environments can be reimagined, and how technologies can be
programmed to serve radical sexual justice agendas.

N2  - Background-Abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging scans are common both before and after surgery for congenital heart disease in early infancy. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the nature, timing, and consequences of brain injury on magnetic resonance imaging in a cohort of young infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease both with and without cardiopulmonary bypass.
Methods and Results-A total of 153 infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease at <8 weeks of age underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging scans before and after surgery and at 3 months of age, as well as neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age. White matter injury (WMI) was the commonest type of injury both before and after surgery. It occurred in 20% of infants before surgery and was associated with a less mature brain. New WMI after surgery was present in 44% of infants and at similar rates after surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. The most important association was diagnostic group (P<0.001). In infants having arch reconstruction, the use and duration of circulatory arrest were significantly associated with new WMI. New WMI was also associated with the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, postoperative lactate level, brain maturity, and WMI before surgery. Brain immaturity but not brain injury was associated with impaired neurodevelopment at 2 years of age.
Conclusions-New WMI is common after surgery for congenital heart disease and occurs at the same rate in infants undergoing surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass. New WMI is associated with diagnostic group and, in infants undergoing arch surgery, the use of circulatory arrest. (Circulation. 2013; 127: 971-979.)

N2  - A history of the United States' systematic expulsion of
"undesirables" and immigrants, told through the lives of the
passengers who travelled from around the world,
only to be locked up and forced out aboard America's first
deportation trains. The United States, celebrated as a
nation of immigrants and the land of the free, has developed the
most extensive system of imprisonment and deportation that the
world has ever known. The Deportation Express is the first
history of American deportation trains: a network of prison
railroad cars repurposed by the Immigration Bureau to link jails,
hospitals, asylums, and workhouses across the country and allow
forced removal with terrifying efficiency. With this book,
historian Ethan Blue uncovers the origins of the deportation train
and finds the roots of the current moment, as immigrant restriction
and mass deportation once again play critical and troubling roles
in contemporary politics and legislation. A century ago,
deportation trains made constant circuits around the nation,
gathering so-called "undesirable aliens"-migrants disdained for
their poverty, political radicalism, criminal conviction, or mental
illness-and conveyed them to ports for exile overseas. Previous
deportation procedures had been violent, expensive, and relatively
ad hoc, but the railroad industrialized the expulsion of the
undesirable. Trains provided a powerful technology to divide
"citizens" from "aliens" and displace people in unprecedented
numbers. Drawing on the lives of migrants and the agents who
expelled them, The Deportation Express is history told
from aboard a deportation train. By following the lives of selected
individuals caught within the deportation regime, this book
dramatically reveals how the forces of state exclusion accompanied
epic immigration in early twentieth-century America. These are the
stories of people who traveled from around the globe, only to be
locked up and cast out, deported through systems that bound the
United States together, and in turn, pulled the world apart. Their
journey would be followed by millions more in the years to come.

N2  - More than 10 million people are incarcerated worldwide; this number has increased by about a million in the past decade. Mental disorders and infectious diseases are more common in prisoners than in the general population. High rates of suicide within prison and increased mortality from all causes on release have been documented in many countries. The contribution of prisons to illness is unknown, although shortcomings in treatment and aftercare provision contribute to adverse outcomes. Research has highlighted that women, prisoners aged 55 years and older, and juveniles present with higher rates of many disorders than do other prisoners. The contribution of initiatives to improve the health of prisoners by reducing the burden of infectious and chronic diseases, suicide, other causes of premature mortality and violence, and counteracting the cycle of reoffending should be further examined.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to better understand acts of self-harm among inmates in correctional institutions.
Methods. We analyzed data from medical records on 244 699 incarcerations in the New York City jail system from January 1, 2010, through January 31, 2013.
Results. In 1303 (0.05%) of these incarcerations, 2182 acts of self-harm were committed, (103 potentially fatal and 7 fatal). Although only 7.3% of admissions included any solitary confinement, 53.3% of acts of self-harm and 45.0% of acts of potentially fatal self-harm occurred within this group. After we controlled for gender, age, race/ethnicity, serious mental illness, and length of stay, we found self-harm to be associated significantly with being in solitary confinement at least once, serious mental illness, being aged 18 years or younger, and being Latino or White, regardless of gender.
Conclusions. These self-harm predictors are consistent with our clinical impressions as jail health service managers. Because of this concern, the New York City jail system has modified its practices to direct inmates with mental illness who violate jail rules to more clinical settings and eliminate solitary confinement for those with serious mental illness.

N2  - Although "entry fiction" emerged in immigration and constitutional law over a century ago, the doctrine has yet to account for present-day carceral and technological realities. Under entry fiction, "arriving" immigrants stopped at the border are deemed "unentered" and "not here" for constitutional due process purposes, even in detention centers deep within the United States. As a result, the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") uses its sole discretion to detain tens of thousands of arriving asylum seekers in its facilities without a bond hearing. Despite significant modern changes in immigration statutes and due process jurisprudence, the Supreme Court recently suggested, but did not decide, that individuals subject to entry fiction may continue to lack constitutional due process protections against detention. Both courts and the government have invoked sovereign power as the doctrine's justification, asserting that detention is necessary to effect exclusion (removal) of individuals and that entry fiction appropriately protects the government's power to detain.

N2  - Summary Background The burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is disproportionately carried by low-income and middle-income countries and disadvantaged sectors of society such as prisoners. No systematic analysis has been done to assess the prevalence of poor diet, inadequate physical activity, and overweight and obesity in prisoners. We aim to synthesise current evidence and to highlight areas for action and further research. Methods We systematically searched online databases for reports published between 1948 and May, 2011. Studies were screened against eligibility criteria; two authors then independently extracted data with previously agreed proformas. The risk of bias was assessed for each study with a domain-based assessment. Data on body-mass index and physical activity were presented in forest plots; no overall estimates were calculated on account of data heterogeneity. Available data from the population subgroup most similar in terms of age and sex were used to calculate age-adjusted and sex-adjusted prevalence ratios, which estimate the likelihood of insufficient activity and obesity prevalence in prisoners compared with the national population. Findings 31 eligible studies were reported in 29 publications, including more than 60 000 prisoners in 884 institutions in 15 countries. Male prisoners were less likely to be obese than males in the general population (prevalence ratios ranged from 0·33 to 0·87) in all but one study (1·02, 0·92–1·07), whereas female prisoners were more likely to be obese than non-imprisoned women in the USA (1·18, 1·08–1·30) and Australia (prevalence ratios ranged from 1·15 to 1·20). Australian prisoners were more likely to achieve sufficient activity levels than the general population compared with prisoners in the UK (prevalence ratio 1·19, 95% CI 1·04–1·37, for women in Australia in 2009 vs 0·32, 0·21–0·47, for women in the UK; prevalence ratios ranged from 1·37 to 1·59 for men in Australia vs 0·71, 0·34–0·78, for men in the UK). Female mean energy intake exceeded recommended levels and sodium intake was about two to three times the recommended intake for all prisoners. Interpretation Contact with the criminal justice system is a public-health opportunity to promote health in this vulnerable population; the costs to the individual and to society of failing to do so are likely to be substantial. Improved monitoring and further research is essential to inform appropriate targeting of public health interventions.

N2  - This dissertation examines the politics of bureaucratic development in the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with attention to the ways that bureaucratic processes and policymaking shape racial hierarchy in the contemporary era. I argue that contemporary bureaucracies primarily shape race by working to expand and enhance their department’s bureaucratic capacity through modernization and efficiency improving processes. Within each agency, bureaucrats work towards producing efficiency and attempt to demonstrate success in ways that are facially race-neutral but in fact rely upon racial imaginaries. In the context of homeland security, a racial and carceral imagination of who is an “illegal” immigrant undergirds the department as a whole. As such, when bureaucrats work to optimize the departmental processes, the result is improving and expanding tools of social control such as immigrant surveillance, detention, and deportation. This phenomenon is racialized because the primary targets of the enforcement apparatus are Latinx, and as a more efficient architecture is built, the DHS is better able to police the Latinx migrant community. I draw on the work of Hannah Arendt to argue that a major impact of bureaucratic development is inducing thoughtlessness amongst DHS bureaucrats. Here, thoughtlessness refers to the inability to see outside of the work of bureaucracy to examine the particular harm done to those on the other end of the policy. Bureaucrats are institutionally incentivized to focus on performance optimization and in doing so, the human consequences of immigration enforcement are hidden from bureaucrats.To make this argument, I conducted an archival analysis of around 32,000 pages of internal bureaucratic documents from the DHS. This document set spans the time from 2002-2022 and includes documentation such as inspections, FOIA documents, email correspondence, and departmental memoranda. I support this primary document analysis with historical analysis and theoretical work, drawing on Hannah Arendt and Max Weber, as well as critical scholarship on immigration and race such as the work of Mae Ngai, Kelly Tuttle Hernandez, and Patricia Macias-Rojas.To more concretely examine this phenomenon, I center each empirical chapter around a theme of bureaucratic development that I argue has played a major role in expanding the DHS’ role in homeland security. The first empirical chapter focuses on the role of data and metrics in supporting a carceral imagination of homeland security. In this chapter, I argue that the DHS’ focus on carceral solutions to the problem of immigration has led to the use of increasingly granular and seemingly objective performance metrics. However, these metrics reify ideas of homeland security that focus on detaining and deporting racialized immigrant groups with little regard for the human costs of this form of enforcement. My second chapter examines the role of modernization discourse in leading to expanded immigrant surveillance. This chapter focuses on how an internal bureaucratic desire for modernized technology has helped substantiate increased surveillance of immigrant communities and a drive for perfect information. The further the DHS pushes in this direction, the more effectively it is able to surveil and police immigrant communities. My final empirical chapter examines how demands for efficiency have driven the DHS into increased reliance on the private sector. Because the private sector is often understood as more efficient than government, the DHS has been systematically incentivized to work more closely with corporations. The result is a massive industry and investment in homeland security, which sustains the racial project of immigration enforcement. The conclusion focuses on how to remedy the harms of bureaucracy, focusing on practices of institutional transformation and care in order to address the harms I describe in the empirical chapters. I conclude by suggesting that there is an urgent need for both radical change in immigration law and the necessity of bureaucratic change in order to promote immigrant justice.

N2  - The U.S. criminal justice population is aging at a significantly more rapid rate than the overall U.S. population, with the population of older adults in prison having more than tripled since 1990. This increase is at the root of a prison healthcare crisis that is spilling into communities and public healthcare systems because nearly 95% of prisoners are eventually released. The graying prison population is also straining state and local budgets. In prison, older prisoners cost approximately three times as much as younger prisoners to incarcerate, largely because of healthcare costs. In the community, older former prisoners present the least risk of recidivism yet are vulnerable to serious and costly social and medical challenges such as housing instability, poor employability, multiple chronic health conditions, and health‐related mortality; however older current and former prisoners are largely ignored in the current geriatrics evidence base. Knowledge about the health, functional, and cognitive status of older prisoners is limited, with even less known about risk factors for long‐term poor health outcomes during and after incarceration. This article provides an overview of aging in the criminal justice system. It then describes how geriatric models of care could be adapted to address the mounting older prisoner healthcare crisis and identifies areas where additional research is needed to explore prison‐specific models of care for older adults.

N2  - Objectives. We analyzed the prevalence of chronic illnesses, including mental illness, and access to health care among US inmates.
Methods. We used the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities to analyze disease prevalence and clinical measures of access to health care for inmates.
Results. Among inmates in federal prisons, state prisons, and local jails, 38.5% (SE = 2.2%), 42.8% (SE = 1.1%), and 38.7% (SE = 0.7%), respectively, suffered a chronic medical condition. Among inmates with a mental condition ever treated with a psychiatric medication, only 25.5% (SE = 7.5%) of federal, 29.6% (SE = 2.8%) of state, and 38.5% (SE = 1.5%) of local jail inmates were taking a psychiatric medication at the time of arrest, whereas 69.1% (SE = 4.8%), 68.6% (SE = 1.9%), and 45.5% (SE = 1.6%) were on a psychiatric medication after admission.
Conclusions. Many inmates with a serious chronic physical illness fail to receive care while incarcerated. Among inmates with mental illness, most were off their treatments at the time of arrest. Improvements are needed both in correctional health care and in community mental health services that might prevent crime and incarceration.

N2  - Summary Background For some surgical procedures to be done, a patient's blood circulation needs to be stopped. In such situations, the maintenance of blood flow to the brain is perceived beneficial even in the presence of deep hypothermia. We aimed to assess the benefits of the maintenance of antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) compared with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). Methods Patients aged 18–80 years undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy surgery in a UK centre (Papworth Hospital, Cambridge) were randomly assigned with a computer generated sequence to receive either DHCA for periods of up to 20 min at 20°C or ACP (1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint was change in cognitive function at 12 weeks after surgery, as assessed by the trail-making A and B tests, the Rey auditory verbal learning test, and the grooved pegboard test. Patients and assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN84972261. Findings We enrolled 74 of 196 screened patients (35 to receive DHCA and 39 to receive ACP). Nine patients crossed over from ACP to DHCA to allow complete endarterectomy. At 12 weeks, the mean difference between the two groups in Z scores (the change in cognitive function score from baseline divided by the baseline SD) for the three main cognitive tests was 0·14 (95% CI −0·14 to 0·42; p=0·33) for the trail-making A and B tests, −0·06 (−0·38 to 0·25; p=0·69) for the Rey auditory verbal learning test, and 0·01 (−0·26 to 0·29; p=0·92) for the grooved pegboard test. All patients showed improvement in cognitive function at 12 weeks. We recorded no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups. At 12 weeks, two patients had died (one in each group). Interpretation Cognitive function is not impaired by either ACP or DHCA. We recommend circulatory arrest as the optimum modality for patients undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy surgery. Funding J P Moulton Charitable Foundation.

N2  - Aims
World‐wide, more than 30 million people move through prisons annually. Record linkage studies have identified an increased risk of death in ex‐prisoners. In order to inform preventive interventions it is necessary to understand who is most at risk, when and why. Limitations of existing studies have rendered synthesis and interpretation of this literature difficult. The aim of this study was to describe methodological characteristics of existing studies and make recommendations for the design, analysis and reporting of future studies.
Methods
Systematic review of studies using record linkage to explore mortality in ex‐prisoners. Based on analysis of these studies we illustrate how methodological limitations and heterogeneity of design, analysis and reporting both hamper data synthesis and create potential for misinterpretation of findings. Using data from a recent Australian study involving 42 015 ex‐prisoners and 2329 observed deaths, we quantify the variation in findings associated with various approaches.
Results
We identified 29 publications based on 25 separate studies published 1998–2011, mainly from the United Kingdom, United States and Australia. Mortality estimates varied systematically according to features of study design and data analysis. A number of common, avoidable and significant methodological limitations were identified. Substantial heterogeneity in study design, methods of data analysis and reporting of findings was observed.
Conclusions
Record linkage studies examining mortality in ex‐prisoners show widely varying estimates that are influenced substantially by avoidable methodological limitations and reducible heterogeneity. Future studies should adopt best practice methods and more consistent methods of analysis and reporting, to maximize policy relevance and impact.

N2  - From the Cold War through today, the U.S. has quietly assisted dozens of regimes around the world in suppressing civil unrest and securing the conditions for the smooth operation of capitalism. Casting a new light on American empire, Badges Without Borders shows, for the first time, that the very same people charged with global counterinsurgency also militarized American policing at home. In this groundbreaking exposé, Stuart Schrader shows how the United States projected imperial power overseas through police training and technical assistance—and how this effort reverberated to shape the policing of city streets at home. Examining diverse records, from recently declassified national security and intelligence materials to police textbooks and professional magazines, Schrader reveals how U.S. police leaders envisioned the beat to be as wide as the globe and worked to put everyday policing at the core of the Cold War project of counterinsurgency. A "smoking gun" book, Badges without Borders offers a new account of the War on Crime, "law and order" politics, and global counterinsurgency, revealing the connections between foreign and domestic racial control.

Objectives  Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) skills tend to degrade over time. There is mounting evidence that high‐fidelity simulation (HFS) is advantageous to teaching ACLS. The aspects of HFS that enhance learning are not entirely clear, but the anxiety generated by a scenario may enhance retention through well‐established learning pathways. We sought to determine whether an HFS with added emotional stress could provoke anxiety and, if so, whether or not participants learning ACLS would demonstrate better written and applied knowledge retention 6 months after their initial course.
Methods  Twenty‐five student volunteers from Year 1 and 2 at Mount Sinai School of Medicine were randomly assigned to a control group or an emotional content (EC) group for a sudden cardiac death management course. All subjects were monitored for heart rate and were assessed using the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory. Control group participants experienced an HFS in which actors were not scripted to add stress, whereas EC group participants were exposed to an emotionally charged environment using the same actors.
Results  Participants across the two groups were well matched by resting heart rates, baseline anxiety and prior ACLS knowledge. The EC group participants experienced greater anxiety than controls (mean state anxiety score: 35.0 versus 28.2 [p < 0.05]; average heart rate [HR]: 94.6 bpm versus 72.9 bpm [p < 0.05]; maximum HR: 120.8 bpm versus 95.3 bpm [p < 0.05]). Six months later, written test scores were similar, but the EC group participants achieved higher practical competency examination (‘mega code’) scores than controls (32.5 versus 25.0; p < 0.05). Independent t‐tests and Spearman rank coefficients were employed where applicable.
Conclusions  Simulation with added emotional stressors led to greater anxiety during ACLS instruction but correlated with enhanced performance of ACLS skills after this course. The quantitative and qualitative values of added stressors need further exploration, but these values represent important variables in simulation‐based education.

N2  - Liberals and conservatives again coalesced in the 1980s to criminalize the sexual conduct of HIVpositive individuals.5 Together, the efforts of these groups produced a new, unprecedented war on sex offenders that targeted a whole range of sexual practices-some of which actually were harmful, others of which were not. Since the 1990s that war has generated new punitive technologies-including state and federal registries of convicted sex offenders, Internet databases giving the public access to personal information about registered sex offenders, and civil commitment laws that allow for the indefinite confinement of sex offenders for "treatment"-that are too harsh even when they are applied to behaviors that do warrant punishment.6 Today, between 10 and 20 percent of state prisoners are incarcerated for sex offenses-in some states the rate is as high as 30 percent-and as of 7 December 2015 the total number of people on the sex offender registry nationally was 843,280.7 Meanwhile, the proportion of sex offenders subject to federal mandatory minimum sentences has skyrocketed (from 5 percent in 2001 to 51 percent in 2010),8 and sex offender registration rates in general have spiked, even as trends in corrections for other types of crimes have plateaued.9 Simply put, the war on sex offenders has been a key contributor to the expansion of the carceral state.

N2  - The contributors to Long Term use the tension between the popular embrace and legalization of same-sex marriage and the queer critique of homonormativity as an opportunity to examine the myriad forms of queer commitments and their durational aspect. They consider commitment in all its guises, particularly relationships beyond and aside from monogamous partnering. These include chosen and involuntary long-term commitments to families, friends, pets, and coworkers; to the care of others and care of self; and to financial, psychiatric, and carceral institutions. Whether considering the enduring challenges of chronic illnesses and disability, including HIV and chronic fatigue syndrome; theorizing the queer family as a scene of racialized commitment; or relating the grief and loss that comes with caring for pets, the contributors demonstrate that attending to the long term offers a fuller understanding of queer engagements with intimacy, mortality, change, dependence, and care.Contributors.

N2  - In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention.

N2  - This paper compares the phenomenological structure of zoological exhibition to the pattern prevalent in pornography. It examines several disanalogies between the two, finds them lacking or irrelevant, and concludes that the proposed analogy is strong enough to serve as a critical lens through which to view the institution of zoos. The central idea uncovered in this process of interpretation is paradoxical: Zoos are pornographic in that they make the nature of their subjects disappear precisely by overexposing them. The paper asserts that the keep are thus degraded or marginalized through the marketing and consumption of their very visibility and criticizes the pretense of preservation. Furthermore, the paper subjects the related framework of captivity to Foucauldian analysis and critique - we see that the "zoopticon" deserves designation as an island of power in the carceral archipelago of hegemonic social institutions mapped by Foucault. Hence, this paper suggests that the zoo as we know it be phased out in favor of richer and less oppressive modes of encountering other forms of life; toward this end, the paper explores and assesses alternative approaches to, and practices of, nonhuman animal spectatorship and cross-species conviviality.

N2  - Enclosing Queer and Crip Futures examines the state-sponsored discourse and practice of eugenics in late nineteenth and early twentieth century California. At the time, eugenics reformers collaborated with the state government to implement programs designed to curb the reproduction of the so-called defective class. These programs included sterilization, institutionalization, and deportation. This chapter of California history is seldom mentioned today, but when it is, eugenics policies are described as having been discredited along with the “fake” science of racial improvement. I challenge the presumption that eugenics policies are aberrant to an otherwise progressive march of history. Instead, the dissertation implicates eugenics as central to the project of building a modern liberal state in California.Based on original research in the California State Archives and the California Historical Society, the dissertation tracks how turn of the century eugenics discourse expanded and developed new technologies of power for the state to wield over bodies, temporality, land, capital, and desire. These technologies of liberal power rooted in eugenics discourses included, first, the violent attachment of difference to bodies. I analyze the discursive construction of the gendered, racialized, and disabling “defective class” and the process of attaching difference to bodies through institutional medicine. Second, eugenics expanded the carceral infrastructure of the state and a gendered logic of confinement, by legitimating mass institutionalization at state hospitals, state homes for the feeble-minded, and adult and youth reformatories. Third, eugenics discourse signals a break from laissez-faire political economy, and the establishment of a state biopolitical power that exceeds the interests of capital. I examine how Progressives enforced a version of freedom secured through liberal state power, challenging capitalist notions of freedom and the radical dreams of freedom articulated by the underclass.Examining these technologies of governance as forms of enclosure, I demonstrate that the practice of eugenics in California asserted power over the possible futures that could unfold. Eugenics determined the present structure of liberal governance by foreclosing other possible queer and crip ways of being, forms of sociality, ways of organizing space and time, and other desires for freedom. Revisiting the era to reveal the contingency of the present splits the future wide open from eugenicist determination, creating time for queer and crip possibilities to emerge.

N2  - Feminist law and policymakers have been inspired by collectively generated experiences of emotion that help to shape what counts as justice and injustice in campus sexual violence cases. Focusing on events surrounding the Dalhousie University Faculty of Dentistry in 2014-2015, this article explains how emotional incitements in the case contributed to an infrastructure that supported formal and specifically carceral responses to campus sexual violence. Correspondingly, this article explains why alternative modes of legal and political formation that challenged the premises of the formal law, including restorative justice, were misread by some commentators as a form of "weak justice" and therefore outside the bounds of feminist action. The central claim of the article is not that particular emotional reactions are right or wrong, but that feminist law and policymakers should reflect on and assess their political force. Considering the ways that emotions are mobilized reveals the benefits and drawbacks of engaging with law in ways that feel emotionally gratifying and therefore politically necessary, but which can lead to harmful consequences that contradict feminist goals.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Little is known about the risk of individuals who are released from correctional facilities, a time where their may be discontinuity in care. OBJECTIVE To study the risk for hospitalizations among former inmates soon after their release from correctional facilities. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS Data from Medicare administrative claims for 110 419 fee-for-service beneficiaries who were released from a correctional facility from 2002 through 2010 and controls matched by age, sex, race, Medicare status, and residential zip code. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hospitalization rates and specifically those for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions 7, 30, and 90 days after release. RESULTS Of 110 419 released inmates, 1559 individuals (1.4%) were hospitalized within 7 days after release; 4285 individuals (3.9%) within 30 days; and 9196 (8.3%) within 90 days. The odds of hospitalization was higher for released inmates compared with those of matched controls (within 7 days: odds ratio [OR], 2.5 [95% CI, 2.3-2.8]; within 30 days: OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 2.0-2.2]; and within 90 days: OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.7-1.9]). Compared with matched controls, former inmates were more likely to be hospitalized for ambulatory care–sensitive conditions (within 7 days: OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4-2.1]; within 30 days: OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5-1.8]; and within 90 days: OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.5-1.7]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE About 1 in 70 former inmates are hospitalized for an acute condition within 7 days of release, and 1 in 12 by 90 days, a rate much higher than in the general population.

N2  - Although incarceration rates have risen sharply since the 1970s, medical sociology has largely neglected the health effects of imprisonment. Incarceration might have powerful effects on health, especially if it instills stigma, and it could provide sociologists with another mechanism for understanding health disparities. This study identifies some of incarceration's direct and indirect effects and rigorously tests them using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. It finds that incarceration has powerful effects on health, but only after release. A history of incarceration strongly increases the likelihood of severe health limitations. Furthermore, any contact with prison is generally more important than the amount of contact, a finding consistent with a stigma-based interpretation. Although this relationship is partly attributable to diminished wage growth and marital instability, the bulk of the effect remains even under the most stringent of specifications, including controls for intelligence and the use of fixed effects, suggesting a far-reaching process with a proliferation of risk factors. The study also finds that incarceration contributes only modestly to racial disparities, that there are few synergistic interactions between incarceration and other features of inequality, including schooling, and that the evidence for a causal effect is much weaker among persistent recidivists and those serving exceptionally long sentences. These study findings are inconsistent with recent speculation; nevertheless, incarceration is an important addition to sociology's research agenda. Exploring incarceration could lead to, among other things, a fruitful synergy among studies on fundamental causes, stigma, and stress.

N2  - An exponential rise in the number of older prisoners is creating new and costly challenges for the criminal justice system, state economies, and communities to which older former prisoners return. We convened a meeting of 29 national experts in correctional health care, academic medicine, nursing, and civil rights to identify knowledge gaps and to propose a policy agenda to improve the care of older prisoners. The group identified 9 priority areas to be addressed: definition of the older prisoner, correctional staff training, definition of functional impairment in prison, recognition and assessment of dementia, recognition of the special needs of older women prisoners, geriatric housing units, issues for older adults upon release, medical early release, and prison-based palliative medicine programs.

N2  - Miller wisely sets boundaries around the constellation of grammatical variations on her chosen noun, reminding us that her analysis "focus[es] on extraction as an activity" dependent on geology (5). In this response, I take up Miller's offer of a "methodology capable of working on multiple timescales" to shift the associative energies of extraction from the geological to the biological and to work, eccentrically and allusively, back and forth in time to trace a personal history of my own response to her central term (22). To be seen as of "Chinese extraction," in the way that my great-grandmother saw my father or policemen saw U.S. citizens, is to possess an ongoing and indelible admixture that, whatever the physical realities of geographical location might suggest, connects with harsh, even carceral, consequence to national and racial origin. Josephine McDonagh and Briony Wickes give a succinct overview of the historical legacy of papaver somniferum, writing that "opium and the technologies of cultivation, communication (largely steam powered), economic exchange (licit and illicit), military power, and individual and national freedoms associated with it, shaped social life in regions across the world and the East and the West" (5).

N2  - Objectives. I investigated the differential impact of the dose–response of length of stay on postprison mortality among parolees.
Methods. Using 1989–2003 New York State parole administrative data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics on state correctional facilities, I employed multinomial logistic regression analyses and formal demographic techniques that used the life table of the populations to deduce changes in life expectancy.
Results. Each additional year in prison produced a 15.6% increase in the odds of death for parolees, which translated to a 2-year decline in life expectancy for each year served in prison. The risk was highest upon release from prison and declined over time. The time to recovery, or the lowest risk level, was approximately two thirds of the time served in prison.
Conclusions. Incarceration reduces life span. Future research should investigate the pathways to this higher mortality and the possibilities of recovery.

Dans le cadre de la recherche interventionnelle TABAPRI, nous avons mobilisé une première étude sociologique afin d’apporter des connaissances sur cette problématique. Une enquête a été réalisée au sein de trois établissements pénitentiaires, précédant les phases de construction, d’implémentation et d’évaluation de l’intervention. Cet article décrit d’une part la démarche méthodologique et d’autre part, la contribution de la sociologie, tant dans ses apports conceptuels que méthodologiques, à la construction d’une intervention. Notre travail a notamment souligné l’importance d’aménager des espaces d’échange permettant aux professionnels et aux personnes détenues de construire ensemble les modalités d'intervention qui participent à la réduction du tabagisme en détention.

N2  - Despite a recent decline in the U.S. prison population, the older prisoner population is growing rapidly. U.S. prisons are constitutionally required to provide health care to prisoners. As the population ages, healthcare costs rise, states are forced to cut spending, and many correctional agencies struggle to meet this legal standard of care. Failure to meet the healthcare needs of older prisoners, who now account for nearly 10% of the prison population, can cause avoidable suffering in a medically vulnerable population and violation of the constitutional mandate for timely access to an appropriate level of care while incarcerated. Older prisoners who cannot access adequate health care in prison also affect community healthcare systems because more than 95% of prisoners are eventually released, many to urban communities where healthcare disparities are common and acute healthcare resources are overused. A lack of uniform quality and cost data has significantly hampered innovations in policy and practice to improve value in correctional health care (achieving desired health outcomes at sustainable costs). With their unique knowledge of complex chronic disease management, experts in geriatrics are positioned to help address the aging crisis in correctional health care. This article delineates the basic health, cost, and outcomes data that geriatricians and gerontologists need to respond to this crisis, identifies gaps in the available data, and anticipates barriers to data collection that, if addressed, could enable clinicians and policy‐makers to evaluate and improve the value of geriatric prison health care.

N2  - Background
Although suicide rates among prisoners are high and vary between countries, it is uncertain whether this reflects the importation of risk from the general population or is associated with incarceration rates.
Methods
We collected data on suicides and undetermined deaths in 12 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) directly from their prison administrations for 2003–2007. These were compared with rates of suicides in the general population separately by gender using Pearson’s correlations. In addition, they were compared with rates of incarceration. Linear regression was used to examine any association after adjustment for rates of incarceration.
Results
Data were collected on 861 suicides in prison, of which 810 were in men. In the men, crude relative rates of suicide were at least three times higher than the general population. Western European countries had similar rates of prisoner suicide which were mostly higher than those in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. There was no association between rates of suicide in prisoners and general population rates or rates of incarceration. In the women, inmate suicide rates varied widely and were mostly raised compared with rates in the general population. In addition, these rates did not appear to be associated with general population rates of suicide.
Conclusions
Rates of prison suicide do not reflect general population suicide rates, suggesting that variations in prison suicide rates reflect differences in criminal justice systems including, possibly, the provision of psychiatric care in prison.

N2  - Objectives. We examined the association of family member incarceration with cardiovascular risk factors and disease by gender.
Methods. We used a sample of 5470 adults aged 18 years and older in the National Survey of American Life, a 2001–2003 nationally representative cross-sectional survey of Blacks and Whites living in the United States, to examine 5 self-reported health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart attack or stroke, obesity, and fair or poor health).
Results. Family member incarceration was associated with increased likelihood of poor health across all 5 conditions for women but not for men. In adjusted models, women with family members who were currently incarcerated had 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 2.00), 2.53 (95% CI = 1.80, 3.55), and 1.93 (95% CI = 1.45, 2.58) times the odds of being obese, having had a heart attack or stroke, and being in fair or poor health, respectively.
Conclusions. Family member incarceration has profound implications for women’s cardiovascular health and should be considered a unique risk factor that contributes to racial disparities in health.

N2  - This dissertation examines questions of political solidarity across uneven difference by focusing on how processes of information coordination, production, and circulation shape social movements formations. I demonstrate how shifting relationships between marginalized people and institutions of state and corporate power shape how groups differently engage and use technologies within social movements. Drawing on insights from multiracial and working class social movements alongside histories of computing and technology, this dissertation contributes to broader concerns in studies of critical race, digital media, and social movements by insisting upon both racial and class consciousness within projects of communication. This project addresses the question of contemporary digital media and social movements from a historical perspective by situating the emergence of different political subjectivities, particularly racialized, working class claims-making and politics, through political economic, technological and policy changes. Chapter 1 introduces Asian America as a mediated political formation to complicate presumptions around technology and solidarity, given its historical entanglements and encounters around U.S. capital, empire, and militarism, all of which also undergird histories of technological innovation. Chapter 2 draws from the archival materials of the Third World Women’s Alliance (1968-1979) to offer an alternate history of networking that foregrounds the politics of difference and highlight ways liberal individualism within dominant computing narratives can be a security threat to collective safety. Chapter 3 looks at the technological conditions for solidarity by juxtaposing the creation of information sharing infrastructures by state actors and progressive left movements during the 1990s, which is marked by both the popularization of the Internet alongside the expansion of anti-immigration and carceral policy reforms that created new punitive codes of racialization. These histories lead up to Chapter 4, which assesses how organizers navigate the competitive information marketplace in today’s digital landscape. Here, I discuss the convergence between the optimization of technological performance—the maximizing of efficiency, speed, and capacity—and performances of solidarity.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) management in correctional settings is logistically feasible, but HIV-related outcomes before release have not been recently systematically examined. OBJECTIVE To evaluate HIV treatment outcomes throughout incarceration, including jail and prison. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of longitudinally linked demographic, pharmacy, and laboratory data on 882 prisoners within the Connecticut Department of Correction (2005-2012) with confirmed HIV infection, who were continually incarcerated 90 days or more, had at least 2 HIV-1 RNA and CD4 lymphocyte measurements, and were prescribed antiretroviral therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Three electronic databases (correctional, laboratory, and pharmacy) were integrated to assess HIV viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA levels, <400 copies/mL) on intake and release. Secondary outcomes were mean change in log-transformed HIV-1 RNA levels and mean change in CD4 lymphocyte count during incarceration. Demographic characteristics, prescribed pharmacotherapies, receipt of directly observed therapy, and duration of incarceration were analyzed as possible explanatory variables for HIV viral suppression in logistic regression models. RESULTS Among 882 HIV-infected prisoners with 1185 incarceration periods, mean HIV-1 RNA level decreased by 1.1 log10 and CD4 lymphocyte count increased by 98 cells/µL over time, with a higher proportion achieving viral suppression by release compared with entry (70.0% vs 29.8%; P < .001); 36.9% of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens were changed during incarceration. After adjusting for baseline HIV-1 RNA level, prerelease viral suppression correlated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.26-2.59) and psychiatric disorder severity below the sample median (adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12-1.99), but not race/ethnicity, incarceration duration, ART regimen or dosing strategy, or directly observed therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Though just one-third of HIV-infected prisoners receiving ART entered correctional facilities with viral suppression, HIV treatment was optimized during incarceration, resulting in the majority achieving viral suppression by release. Treatment for HIV within prison is facilitated by a highly structured environment and, when combined with simple well-tolerated ART regimens, can result in viral suppression during incarceration. In the absence of important and effective community-based resources, incarceration can be an opportunity of last resort to initiate continuous ART for individual health and, following the “treatment as prevention” paradigm, potentially reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission to others after release if continuity of HIV care is sustained.

N2  - CONTEXT Interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the first weeks after release from prison may increase risk for adverse clinical outcomes, transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and drug-resistant HIV reservoirs in the community. The extent to which HIV-infected inmates experience ART interruption following release from prison is unknown. OBJECTIVES To determine the proportion of inmates who filled an ART prescription within 60 days after release from prison and to examine predictors of this outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of all 2115 HIV-infected inmates released from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison system between January 2004 and December 2007 and who were receiving ART before release. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Proportion of inmates who filled an ART prescription within 10, 30, and 60 days of release from prison. RESULTS Among the entire study cohort (N = 2115), an initial prescription for ART was filled by 115 (5.4%) inmates within 10 days of release (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5%-6.5%), by 375 (17.7%) within 30 days (95% CI, 16.2%-19.4%), and by 634 (30.0%) within 60 days (95% CI, 28.1%-32.0%). In a multivariate analysis of predictors (including sex, age, race/ethnicity, viral load, duration of ART, year of discharge, duration of incarceration, parole, and AIDS Drug Assistance Program application assistance), Hispanic and African American inmates were less likely to fill a prescription within 10 days (adjusted estimated risk ratio [RR], 0.4 [95% CI, 0.2-0.8] and 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3-0.7], respectively) and 30 days (adjusted estimated RR, 0.7 [95% CI, 0.5-0.9] and 0.7 [95% CI, 0.5-0.9]). Inmates with an undetectable viral load were more likely to fill a prescription within 10 days (adjusted estimated RR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.7]), 30 days (1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]), and 60 days (1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.5]). Inmates released on parole were more likely to fill a prescription within 30 days (adjusted estimated RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]) and 60 days (1.5 [95% CI, 1.4-1.7]). Inmates who received assistance completing a Texas AIDS Drug Assistance Program application were more likely to fill a prescription within 10 days (adjusted estimated RR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.0-4.9]), 30 days (1.8 [95% CI, 1.4-2.2]), and 60 days (1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]). CONCLUSION Only a small percentage of Texas prison inmates receiving ART while incarcerated filled an initial ART prescription within 60 days of their release.

N2  - Correctional populations have an elevated human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, yet many individuals lack access to subspecialty care. Our study showed that HIV-infected inmates had significantly greater virologic suppression and higher CD4 T-lymphocyte counts when managed by a multidisciplinary team of subspecialists conducting clinics via telemedicine. In other studies, these outcomes have been associated with reductions on HIV-related morbidity and mortality, as well as HIV transmission.

N2  - Across the globe, disabled girls of color have unique school experiences and perspectives. However, they are often left out of educational research. In addition, their experiences are not included in conversations focused on transforming school systems and practices, even though they have solutions for educational equity and justice. Grounded in intersectionality and critical spatial theory, this study expands current understandings of how school systems and practices impact disabled youth of color broadly by considering the distinct intersectional educational trajectories of disabled girls of color in middle and high school in the United States. Through their counter-narratives, photographs, and maps, focal participants revealed how materializations (e.g. school geographies, learning tools) and adult actions impacted their academic and social opportunities at school. This study adds to the current literature with a purposeful focus on the experiences and solutions of disabled girls of color. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
Points of interest
This article looks in detail at the experiences of disabled girls of color in the U.S. in one middle school and one high school.
Disabled girls of color were often accompanied by adults throughout the school day. Few girls could travel to classrooms on their own or with friends or store personal materials in their own lockers. Disabled girls of color had limited access to many school spaces and classrooms.
Most disabled girls of color did not have access to preferred writing tools (e.g. pencils, pens). Most girls had fewer math and science materials and electronic devices (e.g. laptops, tablets) to learn with compared to other students at their school.
The researchers recommend teachers ask disabled girls of color about their experiences to ensure they have access to spaces and materials for meaningful learning. Teachers could use photography and map-making to learn about student experiences and modify their teaching practices.

N2  - This article examines the relationship between incarceration and health functioning. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the relationship between incarceration and more than 20 different measures of health are tested. Using multiple analytic procedures, a distinctive pattern of association emerges. Individuals with a history of incarceration appear consistently more likely to be afflicted with infectious disease and other illnesses associated with stress. In contrast, no consistent relationships were observed between incarceration status and ailments unrelated to stress or infectious disease. The results suggest that exposure to infectious disease and stress are important to understanding the lasting impact of incarceration on health.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To review studies of the prevalence of substance abuse and dependence in prisoners on reception into custody.
Design and method  A systematic review of studies measuring the prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse and dependence in male and female prisoners on reception into prison was conducted. Only studies using standardized diagnostic criteria were included. Relevant information, such as mean age, gender and type of prisoner, was recorded for eligible studies. The prevalence estimates were compared with those from large cross‐sectional studies of prevalence in prison populations.
Findings  Thirteen studies with a total of 7563 prisoners met the review criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity among the studies. The estimates of prevalence for alcohol abuse and dependence in male prisoners ranged from 18 to 30% and 10 to 24% in female prisoners. The prevalence estimates of drug abuse and dependence varied from 10 to 48% in male prisoners and 30 to 60% in female prisoners.
Conclusions  The prevalence of substance abuse and dependence, although highly variable, is typically many orders of magnitude higher in prisoners than the general population, particularly for women with drug problems. This highlights the need for screening for substance abuse and dependence at reception into prison, effective treatment while in custody, and follow‐up on release. Specialist addiction services for prisoners have the potential to make a considerable impact.

N2  - "2 This observation about United Nations entities could also have been made about human rights scholarship in general.3 Gender, race and class have long been identified as factors that may intersect with, compound and add to other experiences of oppression.4 Indigenous feminists have generated a fierce scholarship on intersectionality, engaging with both what is gained and what is put at risk when Indigenous people adopt an intersectional approach and in particular questioning whether feminist thought is the best route for bringing a gendered perspective to experiences of Indigeneity.5 However, the exploration of how disability inflects with other social locations is a relatively new subject area of intersectional analysis.6 Despite the fact that 30 per cent of the self-identified Indigenous population in Canada also self-identify as disabled,7 the specific intersection of disability and Indigeneity has until recently attracted scant scholarly attention8 (although there are exceptions such as in the area of carceral studies9 and through thework of Indigenous advocacy organizations, such as the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC)).10 This lack of attention, or inaction, on intersectionality is also experienced on the ground. The results of community surveys conducted by NWAC in 2017 with Indigenous women and gender diverse people living with disabilities, as well as their caretakers, are informative.11 NWAC reports respondents' experiences of Indigenous-run organizations seldom taking the interplay between accessibility and gender into account, and government-run organizations not adequately taking culture, gender and accessibility into account.12 The British Columbia Aboriginal Network on Disability Society found similar experiences in Indigenous community schools. "14 Based on the survey findings, and their literature review, the Association reported a lack of (and need for) data and peer-reviewed studies concerning their communities.15 They describe this missing information as required to understand the types of disabilities experienced in First Nations communities and the challenges arising from factors such as Indigenous communities having "different cultural meanings for disabilities and barriers. In particular, the risks of each of the instruments potentially reflecting or being interpreted as reflecting single identity politics, which can lead to conflating, ignoring or an inability to engage intra-group differences.19 For example, Avery et al caution that the CRPD and UNDRIP both suffer from "unidimensional design" and thus may "fail to capture the composite rights of [Indigenous peoples with disabilities] facing inequality and discrimination.

N2  - While there are many data-driven approaches to identifying individuals at risk of suicide, they tend to focus on clinical risk factors, such as previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and rarely include risk factors that occur in nonclinical settings, such as jails or emergency shelters. A better understanding of system-level encounters by individuals at risk of suicide could help inform suicide prevention efforts. In Philadelphia, we built a community-level data infrastructure that encompassed suicide death records, behavioral health claims, incarceration episodes, emergency housing episodes, and involuntary commitment petitions to examine a broader spectrum of suicide risk factors. Here, we describe the development of the data infrastructure, present key trends in suicide deaths in Philadelphia, and, for the Medicaid-eligible population, determine whether suicide decedents were more likely to interact with the behavioral health, carceral, and housing service systems compared to Medicaid-eligible Philadelphians who did not die by suicide. Between 2003 and 2018, there was an increase in the number of annual suicide deaths among Medicaid-eligible individuals, in part due to changes in Medicaid eligibility. There were disproportionately more suicide deaths among Black and Hispanic individuals who were Medicaid-eligible, who were younger on average, compared to suicide decedents who were never Medicaid-eligible. However, when we accounted for the racial and ethnic composition of the Medicaid population at large, we found that White individuals were four times as likely to die by suicide, while Asian, Black, Hispanic, and individuals of other races were less likely to die by suicide. Overall, 58% of individuals who were Medicaid-eligible and died by suicide had at least one Medicaid-funded behavioral health claim, 10% had at least one emergency housing episode, 25% had at least one incarceration episode, and 22% had at least one involuntary commitment. By developing a data infrastructure that can incorporate a broader spectrum of risk factors for suicide, we demonstrate how communities can harness administrative data to inform suicide prevention efforts. Our findings point to the need for suicide prevention in nonclinical settings such as jails and emergency shelters, and demonstrate important trends in suicide deaths in the Medicaid population.

N2  - The recent intensification of gendered surveillance in the United States underscores how surveillance technologies continue to abet criminalization domestically while enabling the US to renew orientalist narratives of rescue with respect to its military interventions abroad. Building on the 2015 Feminist Surveillance Studies volume edited by Rachel E. Dubrofsky and Shoshana Amielle Magnet, this issue seeks to make a number of new interventions in the study of surveillance and gender. First, it calls for the incorporation of scholarship that approaches the US-led war on terrorism through the lens of gender and sexuality to develop a more refined understanding of how surveillance practices and contemporary imperial imaginaries overlap and inform one another. Second, it reconsiders the frame of carceral feminism by unpacking some of the assumptions around “carcerality” and “feminism.” Finally, it builds on the premise that existing black feminist scholarship has for some time theorized surveillance’s relation to gendered oppression. To do so, it considers how critical framings of hypervisibility and invisibility help us make sense of the racialized, gendered forms of surveillance deployed across the decades: from the mid-twentieth-century national security state to the contemporary neoliberal postfeminist regimes of the twenty-first century.

N2  - Objectives. We investigated whether there were gender differences in chronic medical, psychiatric, and substance-dependence disorders among jail inmates and whether substance dependence mediated any gender differences found.
Methods. We analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of 6982 US jail inmates. Weighted estimates of disease prevalence were calculated by gender for chronic medical disorders (cancer, hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, hepatitis, and cirrhosis), psychiatric disorders (depressive, bipolar, psychotic, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and personality), and substance-dependence disorders. We conducted logistic regression to examine the relationship between gender and these disorders.
Results. Compared with men, women had a significantly higher prevalence of all medical and psychiatric conditions (P ≤ .01 for each) and drug dependence (P < .001), but women had a lower prevalence of alcohol dependence (P < .001). Gender differences persisted after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and substance dependence.
Conclusions. Women in jail had a higher burden of chronic medical disorders, psychiatric disorders, and drug dependence than men, including conditions found more commonly in men in the general population. Thus, there is a need for targeted attention to the chronic medical, psychiatric, and drug-treatment needs of women at risk for incarceration, both in jail and after release.

N2  - Objectives. We used Danish registry data to examine the association between parental incarceration and child mortality risk.
Methods. We used a sample of all Danish children born in 1991 linked with parental information. We conducted discrete-time survival analysis separately for boys (n = 30 146) and girls (n = 28 702) to estimate the association of paternal and maternal incarceration with child mortality, controlling for parental sociodemographic characteristics. We followed the children until age 20 years or death, whichever came first.
Results. Results indicated a positive association between paternal and maternal imprisonment and male child mortality. Paternal imprisonment was associated with lower child mortality risks for girls. The relationship between maternal imprisonment and female child mortality changed directions depending on the model, suggesting no clear association.
Conclusions. These results indicate that the incarceration of a parent may influence child mortality but that it is important to consider the gender of both the child and the incarcerated parent.

N2  - Objective: There is a lack of published information on the management of mumps in a prison setting. We describe an outbreak of mumps that occurred in a medium-security correctional centre (Milner Ridge) in Manitoba, Canada. Methods: A case definition of mumps consistent with that in the document "Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Mumps Outbreaks in Canada" was adopted. Cell culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology were used for case confirmation. Results: Five confirmed cases of mumps infection were identified at the Milner Ridge Correctional Centre between January 12 and February 5, 2009. One additional confirmed case and 3 additional probable cases were identified at a second correctional centre. Outbreak control at Milner Ridge was accomplished by cohorting the affected units of the centre, providing education on mumps, deferring transfers, and monitoring for further cases. Vaccination was offered to inmates and staff on the assumption, based on average inmate age, that the majority of inmates would have previously received, at most, a single dose of mumps-containing vaccine. Conclusion: An outbreak of mumps in a correctional setting was successfully contained via implementation and tailoring of basic infection control measures, and vaccination of inmates and staff. Given the relatively young age of many inmates and the parallels between prisons and dormitories, it could be argued that inmates may represent another group of individuals for whom a second dose of mumps vaccine (if not received in childhood) would be beneficial as primary prophylaxis. Objectif : Il manque d'informations publiées sur la prise en charge des oreillons en milieu carcéral. Nous décrivons une eclosión d'oreillons survenue dans le centre correctionnel à sécurité moyenne de Milner Ridge au Manitoba (Canada). Méthode : Nous avons adopté la définition d'un cas d'oreillons trouvée dans les Lignes directrices pour la prévention et le contrôle des éclosions d'oreillons au Canada. La culture cellulaire, la réaction de polymérisation en chaîne et la sérologie ont été utilisés pour confirmer les cas. Résultats : Cinq cas confirmés d'infection ourlienne ont été identifiés à Milner Ridge entre le 12 janvier et le 5 février 2009. Un autre cas confirmé et trois autres cas probables ont été identifiés dans un second centre correctionnel. On a maîtrisé l'éclosion de Milner Ridge en répartissant en cohortes les unités affectées du Centre, en donnant de l'information sur les oreillons, en retardant les transferts et en surveillant la manifestation de nouveaux cas. On a offert le vaccin aux détenus et au personnel en partant de l'hypothèse que d'après la moyenne d'âge des détenus, la majorité d'entre eux n'avaient déjà reçu, au plus, qu'une seule dose du vaccin combiné contre les oreillons. Conclusion : Une eclosión d'oreillons en milieu carcéral a été endiguée par la mise en œuvre et l'adaptation de mesures de base pour le contrôle des infections et par la vaccination des détenus et du personnel. Étant donné l'âge relativement jeune de nombreux détenus et les parallèles entre les prisons et les dortoirs, on peut soutenir que les détenus représentent un autre groupe de sujets pour qui une seconde dose du vaccin anti-ourlien (si non reçu durant l'enfance) serait bénéfique en tant que mesure de prophylaxie primaire.

N2  - Why in this period of so-called liberal democracy are so many wars of genocide committed, yet these wars are not seen as contradictions to democracy? While we often articulate racism as an aberration to democracy or as a result of scapegoating in times of social crisis, Michel Foucault argues that racism is endemic and permanent in the modern state. He contends that the rise of the carceral system entails a shift from punishment to normalization. This shift is effected through a policing of the body via a technology of the soul. That is, the person who fails to follow the

N2  - Background:  Prisoners’ children appear to suffer profound psychosocial difficulties during their parents’ imprisonment. However, no previous study has examined later‐life outcomes for prisoners’ children compared to children separated from parents for other reasons. We hypothesise that parental imprisonment predicts boys’ antisocial and delinquent behaviour partly because of the trauma of separation, partly because parental imprisonment is a marker for parental criminality, and partly because of childhood risks associated with parental imprisonment.
Method:  This study uses prospective longitudinal data from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD). The CSDD includes data on 411 Inner London males and their parents. We compare boys separated by parental imprisonment during their first 10 years of life with four control groups: boys who did not experience separation, boys separated by hospital or death, boys separated for other reasons (usually disharmony), and boys whose parents were only imprisoned before their birth. Individual, parenting, and family risk factors for delinquency were measured when boys were aged 8–11. Eleven antisocial and delinquent outcomes were assessed between ages 14 and 40.
Results:  Separation because of parental imprisonment predicted all antisocial–delinquent outcomes compared to the four control conditions. Separation caused by parental imprisonment was also strongly associated with many other childhood risk factors for delinquency. After controlling for parental convictions and other childhood risk factors, separation caused by parental imprisonment still predicted several antisocial–delinquent outcomes, even up to age 32, compared with other types of separation.
Conclusions:  Prisoners’ children are a highly vulnerable group with multiple risk factors for adverse outcomes. Parental imprisonment appears to affect children over and above separation experiences and associated risks. Further research on possible moderating and mediating factors such as stigma, reduction in family income and reduced quality of care is required to identify the mechanisms by which parental imprisonment affects children.

N2  - Criminalization is the primary societal response to intimate partner violence in the US. This reliance on criminal legal system interventions ignores several unintended consequences. One of the serious unintended consequences of criminalization - perhaps the most serious unintended consequence - has been the increased rates of arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration of those whom criminalization was meant to protect: victims of intimate partner violence. Criminalized survivors follow a variety of pathways into the carceral system, which fails to recognize their status as victims of violence and punishes them for failure to conform to victim stereotypes as well as for their acts.

N2  - Background:Women prisoners tend to suffer poor health on a range of indicators. This study sought to explore women prisoners’ perceptions of the impact of imprisonment on their health.Methods:This qualitative study involved adult women prisoners in two closed local prisons. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted.Results:Women prisoners reported that imprisonment impacted negatively upon their health. The initial shock of imprisonment, separation from families and enforced living with other women suffering drug withdrawal and serious mental health problems affected their own mental health. Over the longer term, women complained of detention in unhygienic facilities by regimes that operated to disempower them, including in the management of their own health. Women described responses to imprisonment that were also health negating such as increased smoking, eating poorly and seeking psychotropic medication. However, imprisonment could also offer a respite from lives characterised by poverty, social exclusion, substance misuse and violence, with perceived improvements in health.Conclusion:The impact of imprisonment on women’s health was mixed but was largely perceived to be negative. Despite policy initiatives to introduce health promotion in prisons, there is little evidence of the extent to which this has been effective. The current policy climate in the UK makes it especially timely to examine the reported experience of women prisoners themselves about the impact of imprisonment on their health and to re-evaluate health promotion in women’s prisons.

N2  - This collection interrogates relationships between court architecture and social justice, from consultation and design to the impact of material (and immaterial) forms on court users, through the lenses of architecture, law, socio-legal studies, criminology, anthropology, and a former high court judge.
International multidisciplinary collaborations and single-author contributions traverse a range of methodological approaches to present new insights into the relationship between architecture, design, and justice. These include praxis, photography, reflections on process and decolonising practice, postcolonial, feminist, and poststructural analysis, and theory from critical legal scholarship, political science, criminology, literature, sociology, and architecture. While the opening contributions reflect on establishing design principles and architectural methodologies for ethical consultation and collaboration with communities historically marginalised and exploited by law, the central chapters explore the textures and affects of built forms and the spaces between; examining the disjuncture between design intention and use; and investigating the impact of architecture and the design of space. The collection finishes with contemplations of the very real significance of material presence or absence in courtroom spaces and what this might mean for justice.
Courthouse Architecture, Design and Social Justice provides tools for those engaged in creating, and reflecting on, ethical design and building use, and deepens the dialogue across disciplinary boundaries towards further collaborative work in the field. It also exists as a new resource for research and teaching, facilitating undergraduate critical thought about the ways in which design enhances and restricts access to justice.

N2  - Self-efficacy and digital literacy are key predictors to incarcerated
people's success in the modern workplace. While digitization in correctional
facilities is expanding, few templates exist for how to design computing
curricula that foster self-efficacy and digital literacy in carceral
environments. As a result, formerly incarcerated people face increasing social
and professional exclusion post-release. We report on a 12-week
college-accredited web design class, taught virtually and synchronously, across
5 correctional facilities across the United States. The program brought
together men and women from gender-segregated facilities into one classroom to
learn fundamentals in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and create websites addressing
social issues of their choosing. We conducted surveys with participating
students, using dichotomous and open-ended questions, and performed thematic
and quantitative analyses of their responses that suggest students' increased
self-efficacy. Our study discusses key design choices, needs, and
recommendations for furthering computing curricula that foster self-efficacy
and digital literacy in carceral settings.

N2  - Objectives
This study aimed to quantify the health and social needs of older male prisoners in the North West of England, to determine whether their needs were being met, and to explore an age cut‐off for this group.
Methods
Data were collected by interview and case note review. Areas covered included physical health, mental health, personality disorder, cognitive impairment and social need.
Results
A total of 262 prisoners were included in the study. Over 90% had a physical health disorder, most commonly hypertension and osteoarthritis. A total of 61% had a mental disorder, most commonly major depressive disorder and alcohol misuse disorder. There were few differences within age bands for physical health problem or health/social need, but those aged 50–59 years had more mental disorder, including mental illness, substance misuse disorder and personality disorder.
Conclusions
Older prisoners have a high level of health need and a different profile to the rest of the prison population. Fifty appears to be a useful age over which to define this group, and service provision should reflect this in a national management strategy. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Despite the availability of various substance abuse treatments, alcohol and drug misuse and related negative consequences remain prevalent. Vipassana meditation (VM), a Buddhist mindfulness-based practice, provides an alternative for individuals who do not wish to attend or have not succeeded with traditional addiction treatments. In this study, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of a VM course on substance use and psychosocial outcomes in an incarcerated population. Results indicate that after release from jail, participants in the VM course, as compared with those in a treatment-as-usual control condition, showed significant reductions in alcohol, marijuana, and crack cocaine use. VM participants showed decreases in alcohol-related problems and psychiatric symptoms as well as increases in positive psychosocial outcomes. The utility of mindfulness-based treatments for substance use is discussed.

N2  - Background Previous research has demonstrated elevated mortality following release from prison. We contrasted the risk of opioid overdose death with the risk of suicide in a cohort of adults released from prison in Queensland, Australia over a 14-year-period. We examine risk factors for suicide in the cohort, and make comparisons with the general population. Method We constructed a retrospective cohort of all adults released from prison between 1994 and 2007 and linked this to the National Death Index for deaths up to 31 December 2007. Results We identified 41 970 individuals released from prison. Of the 2158 deaths in the community, 371 were suicides (crude mortality rate (CMR) 13.7/10 000 person-years) and 396 were due to drug-related causes (CMR 14.6/10 000 person-years). We observed a spike in drug-related deaths in the first 2 weeks after release from prison but no such pattern was observed for suicide. Being married (HR 0.40) and number of prior imprisonments (HR 3.1 for ≥5 prior incarcerations compared with none) independently predicted suicide. Age, sex, Indigenous status, length of incarceration and offence history were not associated with suicide. The standardised mortality ratios indicated that released women were 14.2 times and released men 4.8 times more likely to die from suicide than would be expected in the population. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the rate of suicide in adults released from prison is similar to the rate of drug-related deaths. Strategies that provide support to vulnerable people after release may reduce suicide in this population.

N2  - Organ procurement from executed prisoners in China is internationally condemned, yet this practice continues unabated in 2014. This is despite repeated announcements from Chinese authorities that constructive measures have been undertaken to conform to accepted ethical standards. While there is unanimous agreement on the unethical nature of using organs from executed prisoners, due to its limitations on voluntary and informed consent, there is insufficient coverage of forced organ procurement from prisoners of conscience without consent. Strategies to influence positive change in China over the last few decades have failed to bring this practice to an end. While organ donation and transplantation services in China have undergone considerable structural changes in the last few years, fundamental attempts to shift practice to ethically sourced organs have floundered. In this article, we discuss the organ trade in China, reflect upon organ procurement from executed prisoners (including both capital prisoners and prisoners of conscience) and provide an overview of contradictory Chinese efforts to halt forced organ procurement from executed prisoners. Finally, we highlight current actions being taken to address this issue and offer comprehensive recommendations to bring this ethically indefensible practice to an immediate end.
The authors discuss the issue of organ procurement from executed prisoners in China, highlight recent regression by China from a commitment to end such practice, and summarize international efforts to encourage an immediate cessation of forced organ procurement from executed prisoners.

N2  - Background: The control of tuberculosis (TB) is founded on early case detection and complete treatment of disease. In the UK, TB is concentrated in subgroups of the population in large urban centres. The impact of homelessness, imprisonment and problem drug use on TB control in London is reviewed.
Methods: A cohort study was undertaken of all patients with TB in Greater London to determine the point prevalence of disease in different groups and to examine risk factors for smear positivity, drug resistance, treatment adherence, loss to follow-up and use of directly observed therapy (DOT).
Results: Data were collected on 97% (1941/1995) of eligible patients. The overall prevalence of TB was 27 per 100 000. An extremely high prevalence of TB was seen in homeless people (788/100 000), problem drug users (354/100 000) and prisoners (208/100 000). Multivariate analysis showed that problem drug use was associated with smear positive disease (OR 2.2, p<0.001), being part of a known outbreak of drug resistant TB (OR 3.5, p = 0.001) and loss to follow-up (OR 2.7, p<0.001). Imprisonment was associated with being part of the outbreak (OR 10.3, p<0.001) and poor adherence (OR 3.9, p<0.001). Homelessness was associated with infectious TB (OR 1.6, p = 0.05), multidrug resistance (OR 2.1, p = 0.03), poor adherence (OR 2.5, p<0.001) and loss to follow-up (OR 3.8, p<0.001). In London, homeless people, prisoners and problem drug users collectively comprise 17% of TB cases, 44% of smear positive drug resistant cases, 38% of poorly compliant cases and 44% of cases lost to follow-up. 15% of these patients start treatment on DOT but 46% end up on DOT.
Conclusions: High levels of infectious and drug resistant disease, poor adherence and loss to follow-up care indicate that TB is not effectively controlled among homeless people, prisoners and problem drug users in London.

N2  - This Handbook provides the knowledge and tools needed to understand how displacement is lived, governed, and mediated as an unfolding and grounded process bound up in spatial inequities of power and injustice. The handbook ensures, first, that internal displacements and their everyday (re)occurrences are not overlooked; second, it questions 'who counts' by including 'displaced' people who are less obviously identifiable and a clearly circumscribed or categorised group; third, it stresses that while displacement suggests mobility, there are also periods and spaces of enforced stillness that are not adequately reflected in the displacement literature; and fourth, it re-evokes and explores the 'place' in displacement by critically interrogating peoples' 'right to place' and the significance of placemaking, unmaking, and remaking in the contemporary world. The 50-plus chapters are organised across seven themes designed to further develope interdisciplinary study ofthe technologies, journeys, traces, governance, more-than-human, representation, and resisting of displacement. Each of these thematic sections begin with an intervention which spotlights actions to creatively and strategically intervene in displacement. The interventions explore myriad meanings and manifestations of displacement and its contestation from the perspective of displaced people, artists, writers, activists, scholar-activists, and scholars involved in practice-oriented research. The Handbook will be an essential companion for academics, students, and practitioners committed to forging solidarity, care, and home in an era of displacement.

N2  - This book engages with the place of law and legality within Australia’s distinctive contribution to global televisual culture.
Australian popular culture has created a lasting legacy – for good or bad – of representations of law, lawyers and justice ‘down under’. Within films and television of striking landscapes, peopled with heroes, antiheroes, survivors and jokers, there is a fixation on law, conflicts between legal orders, brutal violence and survival. Deeply compromised by the ongoing violence against the lives and laws of First Nation Australians, Australian film and television has sharply illuminated what it means to live with a ‘rule of law’ that rules with a legacy, and a reality, of deep injustice. This book is the first to bring together scholars to reflect on, and critically engage with, the representations and global implications of law, lawyers and justice captured through the lenses of Australian film, television and social media.
Exploring how distinctively Australian lenses capture uniquely Australian images and narratives, the book nevertheless engages these in order to provide broader insights into the contemporary translations and transmogrifications of law and justice.

N2  - Abstract Purpose Estimate the prevalence and annual frequency of health risk indicators in young people serving community-based orders (CBOs) and custodial orders in the state of Victoria, Australia. Methods Cross-sectional survey of 242 young people serving CBOs and 273 serving custodial orders in Victoria in 2002–2003. Validated measures included the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for substance dependence, Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire for depression, and Psychosis Screening Questionnaire for psychosis symptoms. Prevalence estimates were adjusted for sampling bias and age- and sex-adjusted for between-group comparisons. Prevalence estimates were applied to 2010–2011 Victorian youth justice data to estimate annual frequencies at the state level. Results The prevalence of substance dependence, poor mental health, and risky sexual behavior was high in both groups. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence estimates were generally higher among those serving custodial orders; however, extrapolating prevalence estimates to statewide youth justice data generally resulted in higher estimated annual frequencies among CBOs. For example, the estimated prevalence of any substance dependence was 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60–72) in those serving custodial orders and 34% (95% CI, 26–42) in CBOs, but the estimated frequency of substance dependence in CBOs in 2010–2011 was 970 (95% CI, 750–1,180), compared with 490 (95% CI, 450–530) in those serving a custodial order. Conclusions There is a compelling case for scaling up health services for young offenders in custody and in the community, and for routinely monitoring the health of young offenders serving custodial and community orders.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to describe the prevalence of childhood traumatic events among incarcerated women in substance abuse treatment and to assess the relation between cumulative childhood traumatic events and adult physical and mental health problems.
Methods. The study was modeled after the Adverse Childhood Events study’s findings. In-depth baseline interview data for 500 women participating in the Female Offender Treatment and Employment Program evaluation were analyzed.
Results. Hypotheses were supported, and regression results showed that the impact of childhood traumatic events on health outcomes is strong and cumulative (greater exposure to childhood traumatic events increased the likelihood of 12 of 18 health-related outcomes, ranging from a 15% increase in the odds of reporting fair/poor health to a 40% increase in the odds of mental health treatment in adulthood).
Conclusions. Our findings suggest a need for early prevention and intervention, and appropriate trauma treatment, within correctional treatment settings.

N2  - Leigh Goodmark's work on domestic violence argues for alternatives to criminal justice to 'solve' issues of gendered violence. The criminalisation of sex work and prostitution is rarely discussed in this context-a rather odd omission given the increasing trend towards 'criminalising demand' and counter-calls for decriminalisation in this domain. In this article, we bring the two debates into conversation, using Goodmark's work to bring analytical clarity to the prostitution debate and connect sex work to wider social justice debates in feminist anti-violence circles. We aim to move the conversation beyond retribution and the view that law is justice to outline a vision of justice for sex workers grounded in the principles of rights, recognition and representation. By contextualising the decriminalisation of prostitution within the framework of a wider anti-carceral justice movement, we seek to build alliances for social justice that transcend the current divide.

N2  - At the end of 2005, ∼7 million people (or 1 of every 33 American adults) were either in jail, in prison, or on parole [1]. Compared with the general public, newly incarcerated inmates have an increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [2]. While incarcerated, inmates are at an increased risk for the acquisition of blood-borne pathogens, sexually transmitted diseases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, and infection with airborne organisms, such as M. tuberculosis, influenza virus, and varicella-zoster virus. While incarcerated, inmates interact with hundreds of thousands of correctional employees and millions of annual visitors [2]. Most inmates are eventually released to interact with the general public. Tremendous opportunities exist for infectious diseases specialists and infection-control practitioners to have an impact on the health of correctional employees, the incarcerated, and the communities to which inmates return. This article presents a brief review of some of the most important infection-control challenges and opportunities within the correctional setting.

N2  - This book explores the conceptual spaces and socio-legal context which mental capacity laws inhabit. It will be seen that these norms are created and reproduced through the binaries that pervade mental capacity laws in liberal legal jurisdictions – such as capacity/incapacity, autonomy/paternalism, empowerment/protection, carer/cared-for, disabled/non-disabled, public/private. Whilst on one level the book demonstrates the pervasive reach of laws questioning individuals’ mental capacity, within and beyond the medical context with which it is most commonly associated, at a deeper and perhaps more important level it challenges the underlying norms and assumptions underpinning the very idea of mental capacity, and reflects outwards on the transformative potential of these realisations for other areas of law. In doing so, whilst the book offers lessons for mental capacity law scholarship in terms of reform efforts at both domestic and international levels, it also offers ways to develop our understandings of a range of linked legal, policy, and theoretical concepts. In so doing, it offers new critical vantage points for both legal critique and conceptual change beyond mental capacity law.
The book will be of interest to researchers in mental capacity law, disability law, and socio-legal studies, as well as critical geographers and disability studies scholars.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  One‐eighth of young adults in the United States report that their biological father has ever been incarcerated (FEI). This study is the first to examine associations between FEI and trajectories of substance use during the transition from adolescence into young adulthood for the US population.
Design  Using multi‐level modeling techniques, trajectories of marijuana and other illegal drug use are examined, with FEI as the primary independent variable.
Setting  Data are from the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative sample of US adolescents beginning in 1995.
Participants  Panels of 7157 males and 7997 females followed from adolescence (7th–12th grades) into early adulthood (ages 18–27 years).
Measurements  Dependent variables included an ordinal measure of marijuana frequency of use in last thirty days, and a dichotomous measure for whether respondent had any use in the last thirty days of illegal drugs such crystal meth, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, PCP, LSD, speed, and ecstasy.
Findings  Among males and females, respectively, FEI is associated with an increased frequency of marijuana use, and increased odds of any other illegal drug use. Interactions between FEI and age further reveal that FEI is associated with an accentuated trajectory (i.e. a steeper slope) of marijuana use, and an elevated risk (i.e. higher mean level) of other illegal drug use.
Conclusions  Analysis provides some of the first evidence that paternal incarceration is significantly associated with drug use among U.S. males and females, even after controlling for a number of family background, parental, and individual characteristics.

N2  - La présente étude se penche sur l’expérience d’individus qui visitent leurs proches dans les pénitenciers fédéraux au Canada, notamment sur les répercussions de l’utilisation d’un appareil de détection de drogues, le scanneur à ions, qui sert d’étape de contrôle des visiteurs des détenus. À partir de données tirées de huit entretiens non dirigés avec des personnes ayant connu des faux positifs sur le scanneur à ions lors de visites en prison, j’étudie les conséquences négatives de ce type de résultats, qui peuvent être assez fréquents, sur la vie des détenus et de leur famille. Même s’ils sont présentés comme des instruments objectifs et non biaisés, la manière dont les scanneurs à ions sont utilisés est empreinte de jugements moraux envers les individus qui visitent leurs proches détenus. J’aborde deux thèmes tirés de l’analyse : l’interaction entre le personnel carcéral et les familles des prisonniers ainsi que l’irrégularité et l’imprévisibilité des scanneurs à ions. L’analyse montre qu’il s’agit d’une technologie à risque d’erreurs qui participe à la stigmatisation – et même à la punition – des familles des détenus. En m’appuyant sur la littérature portant sur les conséquences collatérales de l’incarcération et sur les technologies du risque et de surveillance, je réfléchis à la manière dont les scanneurs à ions participent à l’extension des souffrances de l’incarcération aux visites en prison.

N2  - About 9 million people are imprisoned worldwide, but the number with serious mental disorders (psychosis, major depression, and antisocial personality disorder) is unknown. We did a systematic review of surveys on such disorders in general prison populations in western countries.
We searched for psychiatric surveys that were based on interviews of unselected prison populations and included diagnoses of psychotic illnesses or major depression within the previous 6 months, or a history of any personality disorder. We did computer-assisted searches, scanned reference lists, searched journals, and corresponded with authors. We determined prevalence rates of serious mental disorders, sex, type of prisoner (detainee or sentenced inmate), and other characteristics.
62 surveys from 12 countries included 22 790 prisoners (mean age 29 years, 18 530 [81%] men, 2568 [26%] of 9776 were violent offenders). 3·7% of men (95% CI 3·3–4·1) had psychotic illnesses, 10% (9–11) major depression, and 65% (61–68) a personality disorder, including 47% (46–48) with antisocial personality disorder. 4·0% of women (3·2–5·1) had psychotic illnesses, 12% (11–14) major depression, and 42% (38–45) a personality disorder, including 21% (19–23) with antisocial personality disorder. Although there was substantial heterogeneity among studies (especially for antisocial personality disorder), only a small proportion was explained by differences in prevalence rates between detainees and sentenced inmates. Prisoners were several times more likely to have psychosis and major depression, and about ten times more likely to have antisocial personality disorder, than the general population.
Worldwide, several million prisoners probably have serious mental disorders, but how well prison services are addressing these problems is not known.

N2  - Context
Inmates, notably women, are at greater risk for obesity and metabolic complications than the general population according to several studies from high income countries. Data regarding French correctional institutions are lacking so far. To fill this gap, we have assessed in a sample from a French prison (33 females and 18 males) the gender-specific effect of incarceration on weight and body mass index (BMI) and examined their current metabolic status. Furthermore, to reveal the possible determinants of increased obesity, we analyzed emotional vulnerability, eating behavior and physical activity using self-reported questionnaires.
Results
In this sample, obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) was already frequent in women (18.2%) but rather scarce for men (11%) at prison entry. Incarceration worsened the rate of obesity in both genders (21.2% and 16.7% respectively). At the time of study, abdominal obesity estimated through waist circumference was particularly prevalent in women (69.7%) versus men (27.8%) and metabolic syndrome was detected in 33% of female against none in male inmates. Abdominal obesity was associated with female sex (p<0.03), low physical activity (p<0.05) and eating disorder (p = 0.07) in univariate analyses. Low physical activity remained significant as an explanatory factor of higher abdominal obesity in multivariate analysis. A marked difference between genders was found for practice of physical activity with a higher proportion of women compared to men being inactive (37.9% vs. 11.8%) and fewer women being very active (17.2% vs. 41.2%).
Conclusion
This study revealed that a significant proportion of women of this correctional institution combined established obesity, a metabolic syndrome and very little practice of physical activity which put them at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, obesity should be better surveyed and treated in prison, especially for female inmates. Increased physical activity, adapted to obese women, would be the first mean to decrease obesity and gender differences.

N2  - Objective
To develop an understanding of the stability of mental health during imprisonment through review of existing research evidence relating physical prison environment to mental state changes in prisoners.
Method
A systematic literature search was conducted looking at changes in mental state and how this related to various aspects of imprisonment and the prison environment.
Results
Fifteen longitudinal studies were found, and from these, three broad themes were delineated: being imprisoned and aspects of the prison regime; stage of imprisonment and duration of sentence; and social density. Reception into prison results in higher levels of psychiatric symptoms that seem to improve over time; otherwise, duration of imprisonment appears to have no significant impact on mental health. Regardless of social density, larger prisons are associated with poorer mental state, as are extremes of social density.
Conclusion
There are large gaps in the literature relating prison environments to changes in mental state; in particular, high‐quality longitudinal studies are needed. Existing research suggests that although entry to prison may be associated with deterioration in mental state, it tends to improve with time. Furthermore, overcrowding, ever more likely as prison populations rise, is likely to place a particular burden on mental health services.

N2  - The emotions shame and guilt may represent a critical stepping stone in the rehabilitation process. Often referred to as 'moral' emotions owing to their presumed role in promoting altruistic behavior and inhibiting antisocial behaviors, shame and guilt provide potentially exciting points of intervention with offenders. In this article, we describe current psychological theory and research that underscores important differences between shame and guilt. We note parallels between psychologists' conceptions of guilt and shame, and criminologists' conceptions of reintegrative and disintegrative shaming. We summarize recent research investigating the implications of these moral emotions for criminal and risky behavior, with special emphasis on the handful of studies conducted with actual offenders. We conclude with a discussion of implications for treatment in criminal justice settings.

N2  - The development of antisocial behavior in youth has been examined with neurobiological theories that suggest that adolescents who are less responsive to their environments are less likely to develop empathy in the absence of extant physiological arousal. However, little attention is paid to these individuals' social context. Individuals with adverse early experiences can also exhibit attenuated physiological arousal. The current investigation examines whether psychopathic symptoms or life stress exposure is associated with cortisol and its diurnal rhythm within 50 incarcerated adolescent boys (14–18years old). Ten saliva cortisol samples were collected 1–2weeks after admission to a maximum-security juvenile facility. Hierarchical Linear Modeling distinguished waking cortisol levels, the awakening response (CAR) and the diurnal rhythm. Multiple interviews and self-report measures of CU traits and stressor exposure were collected. Boys with higher levels of CU traits or greater life stress exposure had flat diurnal rhythms and a steeper awakening response in analyses with lifetime stress exposure specifically. Nonetheless, boys who were elevated on both CU traits and prior stress exposure had steeper diurnal rhythms. These results extend neurobiological theories of cortisol and illustrate that boys with the combination of severe stress with CU traits have a unique physiological profile.
•Cortisol and its diurnal rhythm across two days were examined in incarcerated adolescent males.•Callous unemotional traits were associated with a flattened diurnal rhythm and a steeper cortisol awakening response.•Greater life stress exposure including child abuse was associated with a flattened diurnal rhythm.•The combination of CU traits and stressor exposure was linked with steeper diurnal rhythms in the incarceration setting.

N2  - Aims
To estimate hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence and HCV risk among Scottish prisoners.
Design
National sero‐behavioural survey; dried blood spots were collected in order to identify recent HCV infections (i.e. HCV antibody‐negative and HCV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐positive).
Setting
All 14 closed prisons in Scotland.
Participants
A total of 5187 prisoners responded to the survey (79% of available prisoners on survey days) comprising 5076 individuals (after removing incomplete returns and participants surveyed in more than one prison); 95% men, 32% (1625) reported an injecting history (PWID) and median sentence of 9.5 months. HCV antibody samples were available for 4904 participants; there was sufficient sera for HCV PCR for 2446 prisoners who had been in prison for at least 75 days.
Measurements
The estimate of in‐prison recent infections is based on prisoners incarcerated for a sufficient period, i.e. at least 75 days, so that recent infections could be attributed to prison.
Findings
Overall HCV prevalence was 19%; 53% among people who reported an injecting history and 3% among other prisoners. Three recent infections probably acquired in prison were detected. None of the cases reported injecting during their current sentence or any other potential exposure. Estimated incidence was 0.6–0.9% overall and 3.0–4.3% among PWID (assuming all infections acquired through injecting). Fifty‐seven per cent (929) of PWID were receiving opiate substitution treatment (OST) at the time of the survey. Of all prisoners, 2.5% and 8% of PWID reported injecting during their current period of incarceration.
Conclusion
The low incidence of HCV infections in Scottish prisons is due most probably to the low occurrence of in‐prison injecting and high coverage of OST. Low HCV risk can be achieved in prisons without necessarily introducing needle exchange programmes, but close monitoring of risk behaviours is essential. If risk increases, provision of needle exchange should be considered.

N2  - Objectives. We examined the relationship between alcohol outlets, drug markets (approximated by arrests for possession and trafficking), and violence in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2006. We analyzed geographic and environmental versus individual factors related to violence and identified areas high in violent crime.
Methods. We used data from the Boston Police Department, US Census, and Massachusetts State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission. Spatial modeling was employed at the block group level, and violent crime, alcohol outlets, and drug markets were mapped.
Results. Relative to other block groups, block groups in the highest decile of violent crime (n = 55) were found to be poorer (e.g., lower incomes, higher percentages of vacant homes), and they had greater numbers of alcohol outlets and higher drug arrest rates. Alcohol outlets and drug possession and trafficking arrests were predictive of violent crime. Also, spatial effects resulting from neighboring block groups were related to violent crime. Both alcohol outlet density and type were associated with violent crime in a differentiated and complex way.
Conclusions. With drug possession and trafficking arrests as a proxy for drug markets, spatial relationships between alcohol outlets and violence were found in addition to typical sociodemographic predictors.

N2  - Objectives. We assessed gender differences in longitudinal HIV treatment outcomes among HIV-infected jail detainees transitioning to the community.
Methods. Data were from the largest multisite prospective cohort study of HIV-infected released jail detainees (n = 1270)—the Enhancing Linkages to HIV Primary Care and Services in Jail Setting Initiative, January 2008 and March 2011, which had 10 sites in 9 states. We assessed baseline and 6-month HIV treatment outcomes, stratifying by gender.
Results. Of 867 evaluable participants, 277 (31.9%) were women. Compared with men, women were more likely to be younger, non-Hispanic White, married, homeless, and depressed, but were similar in recent alcohol and heroin use. By 6 months postrelease, women were significantly less likely than men to experience optimal HIV treatment outcomes, including (1) retention in care (50% vs 63%), (2) antiretroviral therapy prescription (39% vs 58%) or optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence (28% vs 44%), and (3) viral suppression (18% vs 30%). In multiple logistic regression models, women were half as likely as men to achieve viral suppression.
Conclusions. HIV-infected women transitioning from jail experience greater comorbidity and worse HIV treatment outcomes than men. Future interventions that transition people from jail to community-based HIV clinical care should be gender-specific.

N2  - Despite the dissemination of principles of medical ethics in prisons, formulated and advocated by numerous international organizations, health care professionals in prisons all over the world continue to infringe these principles because of perceived or real dual loyalty to patients and prison authorities.
Health care professionals and nonmedical prison staff need greater awareness of and training in medical ethics and prisoner human rights. All parties should accept integration of prison health services with public health services.
Health care workers in prison should act exclusively as caregivers, and medical tasks required by the prosecution, court, or security system should be carried out by medical professionals not involved in the care of prisoners.

N2  - Objectives. We examined the link between incarceration and sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV, from a social network perspective.
Methods. We used data collected during a social network study conducted in Brooklyn, NY (n = 343), to measure associations between incarceration and infection with herpes simplex virus-2, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis or HIV and sex with an infected partner, adjusting for characteristics of respondents and their sex partners.
Results. Infection with an STI or HIV was associated with incarceration of less than 1 year (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.76) and 1 year or longer (adjusted PR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.08, 1.74). Sex in the past 3 months with an infected partner was associated with sex in the past 3 months with 1 partner (adjusted PR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.79) and with 2 or more partners (adjusted PR = 1.85; 95% CI = 1.43, 2.38) who had ever been incarcerated.
Conclusions. The results highlight the need for STI and HIV treatment and prevention for current and former prisoners and provide preliminary evidence to suggest that incarceration may influence STI and HIV, possibly because incarceration increases the risk of sex with infected partners.

N2  - Objectives. We examined older jail inmates’ predetainment acute care use (emergency department or hospitalization in the 3 months before arrest) and their plans for using acute care after release.
Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 247 jail inmates aged 55 years or older assessing sociodemographic characteristics, health, and geriatric conditions associated with predetainment and anticipated postrelease acute care use.
Results. We found that 52% of older inmates reported predetainment acute care use and 47% planned to use the emergency department after release. In modified Poisson regression, homelessness was independently associated with predetainment use (relative risk = 1.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.10, 1.83) and having a primary care provider was inversely associated with planned use (relative risk = 0.69; 95% confidence interval = 0.53, 0.89).
Conclusions. The Affordable Care Act has expanded Medicaid eligibility to all persons leaving jail in an effort to decrease postrelease acute care use in this high-risk population. Jail-to-community transitional care models that address the health, geriatric, and social factors prevalent in older adults leaving jail, and that focus on linkages to housing and primary care, are needed to enhance the impact of the act on acute care use for this population.

N2  - Recent data indicate that multiple hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (mixed infection, superinfection, and reinfection) are common among injection drug users (IDUs). In this study, we identified and characterized multiple HCV infection episodes among HCV‐seronegative IDU prison inmates (n = 488) enrolled in the Hepatitis C Incidence and Transmission Study cohort. Incident HCV infection with detectable HCV RNA was identified in 87 subjects, 48 of whom completed additional follow‐up to screen for reinfection or superinfection. All HCV RNA–detectable samples were tested for multiple infection through a series of specifically designed nested reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction (nRT‐PCR) with sequencing and HCV RNA level measurement. Sequencing revealed that 22 of 87 (25.3%) subjects were infected by two or more viruses. Nine (10.3%) subjects were designated as prevalent cases of incident mixed infection, because two distinct HCV strains were detected at the first viremic time point. Fifteen further cases of multiple HCV infection (superinfection or reinfection) were identified, two of which also showed baseline incident mixed infections. The incidence of new HCV infection (superinfection and reinfection) during follow‐up was 40/100 person‐years (95% confidence interval, 33‐44/100 person‐years). Spontaneous clearance of viruses from one subtype and persistence of the other subtype after mixed infection was observed in eight subjects. In these subjects, the virus with higher HCV RNA levels superseded the other. Conclusion: This study comprehensively analyzed frequent multiple HCV infections in a high‐risk cohort and provides further insight into infection dynamics and immunity after exposure to variant viral strains. The data presented suggest that HCV RNA levels play an important role in viral competition. (HEPATOLOGY 2010;52:1564‐1572)

N2  - Compassionate release is a program that allows some eligible, seriously ill prisoners to die outside of prison before sentence completion. It became a matter of federal statute in 1984 and has been adopted by most U. S. prison jurisdictions. Incarceration is justified on 4 principles: retribution, rehabilitation, deterrence, and incapacitation. Compassionate release derives from the theory that changes in health status may affect these principles and thus alter justification for incarceration and sentence completion. The medical profession is intricately involved in this process because eligibility for consideration for compassionate release is generally based on medical evidence. Many policy experts are calling for broader use of compassionate release because of many factors, such as an aging prison population, overcrowding, the increasing deaths in custody, and the soaring medical costs of the criminal justice system. Even so, the medical eligibility criteria of many compassionate-release guidelines-which often assume a definitive prognosis-are clinically flawed, and procedural barriers may further limit their rational application. We propose changes to address these flaws.

N2  - Aims
To document the relationships between injecting drug use, imprisonment and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
Setting
Multiple prisons in New South Wales, Australia.
Participants
HCV seronegative prisoners with a life‐time history of injecting drug use (IDU) were enrolled and followed prospectively (n = 210) by interview and HCV antibody and RNA testing 6–12‐monthly for up to 4 years when in prison.
Measurements
HCV incidence was calculated using the person‐years method. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of incident infection using time‐dependent covariates.
Results
Almost half the cohort reported IDU during follow‐up (103 subjects; 49.1%) and 65 (31%) also reported sharing of the injecting apparatus. There were 38 HCV incident cases in 269.94 person‐years (py) of follow‐up with an estimated incidence of 14.08 per 100 py [confidence interval (CI) = 9.96–19.32]. Incident infection was associated independently with Indigenous background, injecting daily or more and injecting heroin. Three subjects were RNA‐positive and antibody‐negative at the incident time‐point, indicating early infection, which provided a second incidence estimate of 9.4%. Analysis of continuously incarcerated subjects (n = 114) followed over 126.73 py, identified 13 new HCV infections (10.26 per 100 py, CI = 5.46–17.54), one of which was an early infection case. Bleach‐cleansing of injecting equipment and opioid substitution treatment were not associated with a significant reduction in incidence.
Conclusions
In New South Wales, Australia, imprisonment is associated with high rates of hepatitis C virus transmission. More effective harm reduction interventions are needed to control HCV in prison settings.

N2  - Objectives. We compared mortality of ex-prisoners and other state residents to identify unmet health care needs among former prisoners.
Methods. We linked North Carolina prison records with state death records for 1980 to 2005 to estimate the number of overall and cause-specific deaths among male ex-prisoners aged 20 to 69 years and used standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare these observed deaths with the number of expected deaths had they experienced the same age-, race-, and cause-specific death rates as other state residents.
Results. All-cause mortality among White (SMR = 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.04, 2.13) and Black (SMR = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05) ex-prisoners was greater than for other male NC residents. Ex-prisoners' deaths from homicide, accidents, substance use, HIV, liver disease, and liver cancer were greater than the expected number of deaths estimated using death rates among other NC residents. Deaths from cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes were at least 30% greater than expected for White ex-prisoners, but less than expected for Black ex-prisoners.
Conclusions. Ex-prisoners experienced more deaths than would have been expected among other NC residents. Excess deaths from injuries and medical conditions common to prison populations highlight ex-prisoners' medical vulnerability and the need to improve correctional and community preventive health services.

N2  - Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) is an increasingly important source of kidney transplants, but because of concerns of ischemic injury during the agonal phase, many centers abandon donation if cardiorespiratory arrest has not occurred within 1 h of controlled withdrawal of life‐supporting treatment (WLST). We report the impact on donor numbers and transplant function using instead a minimum ‘cut‐off’ time of 4 h. The agonal phase of 173 potential DCD donors was characterized according to the presence or absence of: acidemia; lactic acidosis; prolonged (>30 min) hypotension, hypoxia or oliguria, and the impact of these characteristics on 3‐ and 12‐month transplant outcome evaluated by multivariable regression analysis. Of the 117 referrals who became donors, 27 (23.1%) arrested more than 1 h after WLST. Longer agonal‐phase times were associated with greater donor instability, but surprisingly neither agonal‐phase instability nor its duration influenced transplant outcome. In contrast, 3‐ and 12‐month eGFR in the 190 transplanted kidneys was influenced independently by donor age, and 3‐month eGFR by cold ischemic time.

N2  - In the 1960s, as illegal drug use grew from a fringe issue to a pervasive public concern, a new industry arose to treat the addiction epidemic. Over the next five decades, the industry's leaders promised to rehabilitate the casualties of the drug culture even as incarceration rates for drug-related offenses climbed. In this history of addiction treatment, Claire D. Clark traces the political shift from the radical communitarianism of the 1960s to the conservatism of the Reagan era, uncovering the forgotten origins of today's recovery movement.Based on extensive interviews with drug-rehabilitation professionals and archival research,The Recovery Revolutionlocates the history of treatment activists' influence on the development of American drug policy. Synanon, a controversial drug-treatment program launched in California in 1958, emphasized a community-based approach to rehabilitation. Its associates helped develop the therapeutic community (TC) model, which encouraged peer confrontation as a path to recovery. As TC treatment pioneers made mutual aid profitable, the model attracted powerful supporters and spread rapidly throughout the country. The TC approach was supported as part of the Nixon administration's "law-and-order" policies, favored in the Reagan administration's antidrug campaigns, and remained relevant amid the turbulent drug policies of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. While many contemporary critics characterize American drug policy as simply the expression of moralizing conservatism or a mask for racial oppression, Clark recounts the complicated legacy of the "ex-addict" activists who turned drug treatment into both a product and a political symbol that promoted the impossible dream of a drug-free America.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of mental disorder in a representative sample of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Queensland prisons.
Design, setting and participants: Cross‐sectional assessment of mental health using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) and clinical interviews, conducted by Indigenous mental health clinicians who undertook specific training for this purpose, with support from forensic psychiatrists when indicated. We assessed adults who self‐identified as Indigenous and were incarcerated in six of the nine major correctional centres across Queensland (housing 75% of all Indigenous men and 90% of all Indigenous women in Queensland prisons) between May and June 2008.
Main outcome measures: Diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and substance misuse disorders using the CIDI; diagnosis of psychotic illness determined through psychiatrist interviews supplemented by a diagnostic panel.
Results: We interviewed 25% of all Indigenous men (347/1381; mean age, 31.5 years) and 62% of all Indigenous women (72/116; mean age, 29.2 years) incarcerated at the time of our study. The recruitment fraction was 71% for men and 81% for women. Among the 396 individuals who completed both the interview and the CIDI, the 12‐month prevalence of mental disorder was 73% among men and 86% among women. This comprised anxiety disorders (men, 20%; women, 51%); depressive disorders (men, 11%; women, 29%); psychotic disorders (men, 8%; women, 23%) and substance misuse disorders (men, 66%; women, 69%).
Conclusions: The prevalence of mental disorder among Indigenous adults in Queensland custody is very high compared with community estimates. There remains an urgent need to develop and resource culturally capable mental health services for Indigenous Australians in custody.

N2  - This dissertation critically examines the Prison Unit Pet Shelter (PUPS), an animal shelter built within Talbot Correctional Complex, a state prison in the US Gulf South. This prison-based animal shelter is a unique instantiation of the growing trend of animal programs being incorporated into prisons. Within the academic literature, such programs are often presented as evidence of a paradigm shift away from mass imprisonment in the United States, fostering a more ‘humane’ approach to penal policies, while also meeting key needs for both prisoners and animals. However, informed by critical carceral and organizational approaches, this research challenges these prevailing narratives. By employing a critical case study methodology, this research draws on data collected from in-depth interviews with various stakeholders, participant observations of shelter operations, and critical discourse analysis of organizational materials and media representations. The data gathered allows for a comprehensive examination of the discrepancies between the shelter’s discursive portrayals and its operational realities. The findings indicate that while PUPS is promoted as a model of progressive penal reform and effective animal service delivery, its implementation privileges institutional control and legitimacy over positive outcomes for inmates or animals. Not only are these outcomes not prioritized, but the shelter’s operation, intricately tied to the prison’s control mechanisms, perpetuates status quo penal structures that both hinder rehabilitative goals and obstruct effective animal care. This study contributes a critical perspective to discussions on prison animal programs, emphasizing how these initiatives often serve symbolic and operational purposes that support existing carceral ideologies and practices. It argues that programs like PUPS offer a limited and flawed response to broader systemic issues that are embedded in neoliberal society and its prison systems, inviting further scrutiny of prison-based animal programs within the broader discourse of penal reform.

N2  - Objectives. We examined lifetime incarceration history and its association with key characteristics among 1553 Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) recruited in 6 US cities.
Methods. We conducted bivariate analyses of data collected from the HIV Prevention Trials Network 061 study from July 2009 through December 2011 to examine the relationship between incarceration history and demographic and psychosocial variables predating incarceration and multivariate logistic regression analyses to explore the associations between incarceration history and demographic and psychosocial variables found to be significant. We then used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent association between incarceration history and 6 outcome variables.
Results. After adjusting for confounders, we found that increasing age, transgender identity, heterosexual or straight identity, history of childhood violence, and childhood sexual experience were significantly associated with incarceration history. A history of incarceration was also independently associated with any alcohol and drug use in the past 6 months.
Conclusions. The findings highlight an elevated lifetime incarceration history among a geographically diverse sample of BMSM and the need to adequately assess the impact of incarceration among BMSM in the United States.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To determine the effect of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) on mortality among injection drug users.
Design  A cohort of prisoners with a history of injecting opiates who were followed after their release from prison in July 2007. Mortality between July 2007 and December 2008 was determined by linking the National Death Registry with the Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) database.
Setting  Taiwan.
Participants  A total of 4357 amnestied prisoners with a history of opiate injection.
Measurements  The total mortality rates (MR) among the cohort were calculated based on their person‐time contribution to methadone attendance and re‐incarceration during follow‐up. We used survival methods with MMT and re‐incarceration as time‐varying covariates adjusted for length of follow‐up in the community.
Results  A total of 142 deaths occurred: 13 in the 1st week after release [MR = 13.7/100 person‐years (pyrs)], which was greater than that in the next 4 weeks [MR = 3.2/100 pyrs, relative rate (RR) = 4.3, P < 0.001]. Overall, 1982 (46%) subjects enrolled in MMT; however, 1282 of them discontinued MMT after enrolling.
Findings  The mortality among those who continued in MMT attendance was lower (MR = 0.24/100 pyrs) than those who never enrolled in MMT (MR = 2.6/100 pyrs) or those who enrolled but dropped out of MMT (MR = 7.0/100 pyrs) after adjusting for age, gender and human immunodeficiency virus status at amnesty (RR = 0.07).
Conclusions  In ex‐prisoners in Taiwan with a history of opiate injecting, enrollment and continued participation in methadone maintenance treatment is associated with substantially lower mortality.

N2  - Background:  This study investigated the experience of 23 incarcerated male adolescents who participated in an adapted 10‐week mindfulness‐based intervention.
Method:  Participants completed semi‐structured interviews immediately following the final class of the treatment intervention. A six‐step thematic content analysis was used to identify major themes from the transcribed semi‐structured interviews.
Results:  Four major clusters of themes were identified: increase in subjective well‐being, increase in self‐regulation, increase in awareness, and accepting attitude toward the treatment intervention.
Conclusion:  Results suggest that adapted mindfulness‐based interventions are feasible as treatments for incarcerated youth and have promising potential. Clinical implications are discussed.

N2  - Understanding confinement and its complex workings between individuals and society has been the stated aim of carceral geography and wider studies on detention. This project contributes ethnographic insights from multiple sites of incarceration, working with an under-researched group within confined populations. Focussing on young female detainees in Scotland, this project seeks to understand their experiences of different types of ‘closed’ space. Secure care, prison and closed psychiatric facilities all impact on the complex geographies of these young women’s lives. The fluid but always situated relations of control and care provide the backdrop for their journeys in/out and beyond institutional spaces. Understanding institutional journeys with reference to age and gender allows an insight into the highly mobile, often precarious, and unfamiliar lives of these young women who live on the margins. This thesis employs a mixed-method qualitative approach and explores what Goffman calls the ‘tissue and fabric’ of detention as a complex multi-institutional practice. In order to be able to understand the young women’s gendered, emotional and often repetitive experiences of confinement, analysis of the constitution of ‘closed space’ represents a first step for inquiry. The underlying nature of inner regimes, rules and discipline in closed spaces, provide the background on which confinement is lived, perceived and processed. The second part of the analysis is the exploration of individual experiences ‘on the inside’, ranging from young women’s views on entering a closed institution, the ways in which they adapt or resist the regime, and how they cope with embodied aspects of detention. The third and final step considers the wider context of incarceration by recovering the young women’s journeys through different types of institutional spaces and beyond. The exploration of these journeys challenges and re-develops understandings of mobility and inertia by engaging the relative power of carceral archipelagos and the figure of femina sacra. This project sits comfortably within the field of carceral geography while also pushing at its boundaries. On a conceptual level, a re-engagement with Goffman’s micro-analysis challenges current carceral-geographic theory development. Perhaps more importantly, this project pushes for an engagement with different institutions under the umbrella of carceral geography, thus creating new dialogues on issues like ‘care’ and ‘control’. Finally, an engagement with young women addresses an under-represented population within carceral geography in ways that raise distinctly problematic concerns for academic research and penal policy. Overall, this project aims to show the value of fine grained micro-level research in institutional geographies for extending thinking and understanding about society’s responses to a group of people who live on the margins of social and legal norms.

N2  - Social work has experienced long-standing tensions between care and control since its inception. As shifting moral, social, political, intellectual, and market forces have historically shaped social work agendas and practices, so have feminists through politics, research, teaching, and praxis. While radical and critical social work has frequently pushed back against oppressive systems and movements, social work and feminist social work frequently find itself colluding with and/or being coopted by institutions and systems that oppress, coerce, and control certain people and communities.We need not look far for evidence of these tensions, including but not limited to social work practice and interventions steeped in carceral logics and rescue-based work poignantly evidenced by the now defunct Project Rose (Wahab & Panichelli, 2013).Gramsci (1992), pessimism of the mind, optimism of the will, captures the spirit from which we write this editorial, and we turn to paperson’s (2017) A Third University Is Possible for inspiration and critical hope, as we contemplate the tensions above and the emotions they engender.The bits of machinery that make up a decolonizing university are driven by decolonial desires, with decolonizing dreamers who are subversively part of the machinery and part of machine themselves. These subversive beings wreck, scavenge, retool, and reassemble the colonizing university into decolonizing contraptions. They are scyborgs with a decolonizng desire. You might choose to be one of them. (p. xiii)Rather than wonder about dismantling existing institutions in order to build new ones, paperson inspires us to ask, how might social workers and social work scholars repurpose social work institutions and technologies for more emancipatory and decolonizing agendas? How might we embrace and join the scyborg “the decolonizing ghost in the colonizing machine” (p. xxiv) to decolonize social work?

N2  - Materially and symbolically manifest, borders are shaped by history, politics and power. This first special issue of a two-part series brings together an international collective of authors who presented their papers at a conference on Technologies of Bordering convened by the editors at the University of Melbourne, Australia in July 2019. We invited presentations that critically engage with multiple and varied forms of bordering as expressions of power and oppression, as well as those that considered the possibilities and aspirations for more hopeful and progressive futures. Articles explored a range of issues from borders within and beyond detention centres and carceral systems to colonial and postcolonial forms of bordering. Drawing on a variety of empirical research across different spaces and scales, a range of theoretical perspectives and a diversity of methodological approaches, the articles collectively address the material, digital, virtual and human technologies that divide, exclude, contain, control and govern humans and non-humans.

N2  - Background Anti-oxidative extracts from the milk thistle plant ( Silybum marianum ) have been shown to have antiproliferative effects in several tumor types. Silibinin is the primary active component isolated from the crude seed extract, silymarin. It has been used as a dietary supplement for hepatoprotection for over 2000 years. Silibinin has been shown to be safe in multiple animal models and has had no significant adverse events in human studies. We investigated the potential for this nontoxic flavolignan to inhibit proliferation of human colon cancer. Materials and methods Three well-characterized cell lines, Fet, Geo, and HCT116, were studied. The MTT cell-viability assay was performed to study the effect of silibinin on proliferation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was used to determine the effects of silibinin on cell cycle and apoptosis. 4′, 6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole (DAPI) staining with confocal microscopy was used to morphologically confirm these results. Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and expression levels of p21, p27, cyclins B1/D1, and CDK-2 were measured. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels were also measured. The experiments were performed in triplicate and reported as mean values with standard errors. Means were contrasted using analysis of variance with Dunnet’s correction for multiple testing. All statistical testing was two-sided with a significance level of 5%. Results The MTT assay revealed a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect. Treatment with 75 μg/mL resulted in 50% inhibition of cell-viability (IC-50) in Fet and Geo lines at 72 h. An IC50 dose of 40 ug/mL was obtained in HCT116, a poorly-differentiated cell line, at 72 h. FACS analysis demonstrated statistically significant cell-cycle arrest in all cell lines. G2 -M phase arrests in Fet and Geo cell lines ( P < 0.001) and a G1 arrest in HCT116 ( P = 0.005) were noted. Trivial increases in early apoptotic rates (2% to 3%) for Geo and HCT116 were noted on FACS analysis via annexin V-propidium iodide technique ( P < 0.05), but no evidence for apoptosis was seen on Western blot for PARP cleavage or DAPI. Cyclin B1/D1 and CDK-2 levels were inhibited. Increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors, p21 or p27, was noted, and there was no effect on COX-2 expression. Conclusions Silibinin significantly inhibits proliferation through cell-cycle arrest via inhibition of cyclin-CDK promoter activity. Despite its antioxidant profile, there is no effect on COX-2 expression. Apoptosis does not appear to be greatly increased in human colon cancer cell lines Fet, Geo, and HCT116. Rather, inhibition of cell cycle regulatory proteins plays a fundamental role in silibinin’s mechanism of action, and this may serve as a basis for combined use with conventional chemotherapeutics.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This article presents the prevalence, patterns, and sequences of severe psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders among female jail detainees. METHOD: Subjects were a randomly selected, stratified sample of 1,272 female arrestees awaiting trial at the Cook County Department of Corrections in Chicago. Independent clinical research interviewers administered the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version III-R to assess comorbid psychiatric disorders and substance use disorders. RESULTS: Eight percent of the women had both a current severe mental disorder and a current substance use disorder. Nearly three-quarters of those with severe mental disorders also met criteria for one or more substance use disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Because most detainees return to their communities in a few days, these findings have implications for treatment of high-risk women throughout the mental health system.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of our study is then to analyze psychological and judicial features of a subgroup of inmates with substance abuse. Methods: Prisoners with substance abuse (n = 312) were compared to prisoners without substance abuse (n = 591). Recruited inmates completed a semistructured interview for collection of sociodemographic and judicial data and a battery of psychometric tests for assessement of aggression, impulsivity, depression, personality traits, hostility, resilience, and childhood trauma. Results: Substance abusers had on average multiple incarcerations (78.8%), more juvenile convictions (60.2%), more violent behaviors during detention (29.8%), and a history of one or more suicide attempts (20.8%). They also had higher scores on subscales for childhood trauma, higher scores for psychoticism and neuroticism, higher impulsivity levels, worse resilience, increased hostility, and prevalent suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Prisoners with substance abuse constitute a subgroup with increased judiciary and psychiatric issues, possibly due to early life history and psychological characteristics, such as high impulsivity and aggressiveness, poor resilience, and higher suicidal risk.

N2  - Abstract Purpose Relatively little is known about the prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among adolescents who come into contact with the criminal justice system. Methods We undertook screening for TBI among newly admitted adolescents in the New York City jail system using a validated TBI screening tool. A convenience sample of 300 male and 84 female screenings was examined. Results Screening revealed that 50% of male and 49% of female adolescents enter jail with a history of TBI. Incidence of TBI was assessed using patient health records, and revealed an incidence of 3,107 TBI per 100,000 person-years. Conclusions Elevated prevalence and incidence of TBI among incarcerated adolescents may relate to criminal justice involvement as well as friction in jail. Given the large representation of violence as a cause of TBI among our patients, we have begun focus groups with them to elicit meaningful strategies for living with and avoiding TBI.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  People who use heroin are frequently incarcerated multiple times. Reducing re‐incarceration of this group is important for reducing both health risks associated with incarceration and the costs of correctional administration. Opioid substitution treatment (OST) in prisons may help to reduce re‐incarceration, but research findings on this topic have been mixed. In this study, we examined the effect of OST in prison and after release on re‐incarceration.
Design  Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting, participants and measurements  Data on OST and incarceration were linked for a cohort of 375 male heroin users recruited originally in prisons in New South Wales, Australia. Data were linked for the period 1 June 1997–31 December 2006. Re‐incarceration was examined using recurrent‐event survival analysis models. Model 1 examined the effect of OST status at release from prison (i.e. in treatment versus out of treatment on the day of release) on re‐incarceration. Model 2 considered the effect of remaining in OST after release on risk of re‐incarceration.
Findings  Ninety per cent of participants were re‐incarcerated following their first observed release. Pre‐incarceration cocaine use was associated with a 13% increase in the average risk of re‐incarceration. There was no significant association between simply being in OST at the time of release and risk of re‐incarceration; however, in the model taking into account post‐release retention in treatment, the average risk of re‐incarceration was reduced by 20% while participants were in treatment.
Conclusions  In New South Wales, Australia, opioid substitution treatment after release from prison has reduced the average risk of re‐incarceration by one‐fifth.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to validate previous reports of HCV prevalence in jails, identify HCV risk factors prevalence, and identify risk factors associated with HCV infection in this population.
Methods. Inmates at the Buzz Westfall Justice Center (BWJC) in St. Louis, Missouri, were offered risk factor screening for HCV and anti-HCV antibody testing from December 2012 through May 2013. Demographic and risk factor information were assessed for significant associations with positive HCV antibody results. Risk factors that were significantly associated in univariate analysis were assessed using binary logistic regression to model the relationship between positive HCV results and the risk factors and demographics.
Results. Fifty of 304 inmates were positive for HCV, with a prevalence of 16.4%. The risk factors significantly associated with increased risk for positive HCV antibody were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.15 for each year), injection drug use (OR = 53.87; 95% CI = 17.78, 163.21), sex with HCV-positive partner (OR = 7.35; 95% CI = 1.41, 38.20), and tattoos by a nonlicensed provider (OR = 2.62; 95% CI = 1.09, 6.33). Prevalence for women was 3 times that of men (38% vs 12%).
Conclusions. Prevalence of HCV at BWJC was similar to previous jail studies, which is lower than reported prison rates and higher than the general population.

N2  - Sexual citizenship is a powerful concept associated with debates about recognition and exclusion, agency, respect and accountability.
For young people in general and for gender and sexually diverse youth in particular, these debates are entangled with broader imaginings of social transitions: from ‘child’ to ‘adult’ and from ‘unreasonable subject’ to one ‘who can consent’. This international and interdisciplinary collection identifies and locates struggles for recognition and inclusion in particular contexts and at particular moments in time, recognising that sexual and gender diverse young people are neither entirely vulnerable nor self-reliant.
Focussing on the numerous domains in which debates about youth, sexuality and citizenship are enacted and contested, Youth, Sexuality and Sexual Citizenship explores young people’s experiences in diverse but linked settings: in the family, at school and in college, in employment, in social media and through engagement with health services. Bookended by reflections from Jeffrey Weeks and Susan Talburt, the book’s empirically grounded chapters also engage with the key debates outlined in its scholarly introduction.
This innovative book is of interest to students and scholars of gender and sexuality, health and sex education, and youth studies, from a range of disciplinary and professional backgrounds, including sociology, education, nursing, social work and youth work.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the number of deaths among people released from prison in Australia in the 2007–08 financial year, within 4 weeks and 1 year of release.
Design, participants and setting: Application of crude mortality rates for ex‐prisoners (obtained from two independent, state‐based record‐linkage studies [New South Wales and Western Australia]) to a national estimate of the number and characteristics of people released from prison in 2007–08.
Main outcome measures: Estimated number of deaths among adults released from Australian prisons in 2007–08, within 4 weeks and 1 year of release, classified by age, sex, Indigenous status and cause of death.
Results: It was estimated that among people released from prison in 2007–08, between 449 (95% CI, 380–527) and 472 (95% CI, 438–507) died within 1 year of release. Of these, between 68 (95% CI, 56–82) and 138 (95% CI, 101–183) died within 4 weeks of release. Most of these deaths were not drug‐related.
Conclusion: The estimated annual number of deaths among recently released prisoners in Australia is considerably greater than the annual number of deaths in custody, highlighting the extreme vulnerability of this population on return to the community. There is an urgent need to establish a national system for routine monitoring of ex‐prisoner mortality and to continue the duty of care beyond the prison walls.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to (1) elaborate a poststructural framework for examining the outcomes of policies (practices) of governmental institutions on the individual as a subjective being (self) (PART I), then (2) to apply the framework to a specific institutional policy (PART II). The framework developed was based on the historical analytics of Michael Foucault; the policy was welfare (poor relief) policy in America from colonial time to the present. In particular for policy analysis, Foucault's notion of technologies of normalization operating in carceral networks suggests an alternate framework for examining the practices (outcomes of policies) of governmental institutions on the individual. Foucauldian analytics reveal how individuals are constructed by institutional policies ostensibly intended to enhance the individual as a free moral agent (the subjective self). In short, institutions created to deal with social problems such as poverty exercise a transparent agenda of discipline. Foucault defines discipline as the exercise of power that renders the body docile and productive, thus politically and economically useful. When viewed through the general Foucauldian framework, the transparent technologies of discipline embedded in the discourses of poor relief are rendered visible, revealing their coercive power. In this study, the discourse of poor relief policies and practices in three historical periods were examined using Foucault's three technologies of normalization. The three technologies are: Modes of Objectification, Docile Bodies, and Means of Correct Training. During the first period, from 1601-1830, the poor were transformed from neighbors to strangers through Foucault's modes of objectification. During the second period, from 1830-1930, the poor were transformed from strangers to inmates and relegated to institutions such as poor houses where they were rendered docile. The final period was from 1930 to the present. Consistent with the Foucauldian framework, the poor were transformed from inmates to "clients" served by professional social service agents responsible for prescribing means of correct training. In view of the Enlightenment ideal of freedom, this study indicates that more attention should be given to the effects of policy outcomes on the individual. In particular for welfare policies, the recipient must be viewed and considered as a subjective person, rather than as an object within categories of need. The Foucauldian method of policy analysis used in this study can supplement conventional policy by illuminating negative unintended consequences on the individual as a free moral agent.

N2  - Summary Previous research revealed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis abnormalities in relation to antisocial and aggressive behavior. Some evidence suggests that low cortisol levels may serve as a biological marker for a severe antisocial subgroup with pronounced callous–unemotional (CU) traits. Children displaying the combination of severe antisocial behavior and CU traits appear to be particularly at risk of developing adult psychopathy. Given the lack of studies on the relationship between cortisol levels and CU traits in antisocial adolescents, the current study investigates whether cortisol levels are uniquely associated with CU traits as compared to other psychopathy dimensions (i.e., narcissism and impulsivity). Detained antisocial adolescents ( n = 63) and a community comparison group ( n = 62) completed diaries and collected three saliva samples daily on two days, with compliance monitored electronically. Psychopathy dimensions were assessed through self-report questionnaires. Externalizing symptoms were assessed by structured clinical interview. Multilevel regression analyses indicated no differences in cortisol levels or diurnal slopes between the two groups. Overall, cortisol levels were not significantly related to psychopathy dimensions. However, greater impulsivity was associated with lower cortisol levels in the community sample, but not in the antisocial group. Conclusion Results cast doubt on the notion of low cortisol levels as a biological marker for CU traits. Low basal cortisol levels appear to be more closely related to a general deficit in behavioral regulation. Implications for future research are discussed.

N2  - The rate of female incarceration continues to surge, resulting in over 714,000 women currently being held behind bars worldwide. Females generally enter carceral facilities with low educational profiles, and educational programming inside is rarely a high priority. Access to education is a proven contributor to women's social and economic empowerment and can minimise some of the obstacles they encounter after being released from custody. Support for the intellectual potential of incarcerated female 'students' can address intersecting inequalities that impede access to social protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure. Policymakers, academics and activists concerned with gender equality must begin by focusing on academic and vocational program development for female prisoners, built through strong community partnerships, and inclusive of trauma informed supports.

N2  - Background. Francisella novicida is a rare cause of human illness despite its close genetic relationship to Francisella tularensis, the agent of tularemia. During April–July 2011, 3 inmates at a Louisiana correctional facility developed F. novicida bacteremia; 1 inmate died acutely. Methods. We interviewed surviving inmates; reviewed laboratory, medical, and housing records; and conducted an environmental investigation. Clinical and environmental samples were tested by culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multigene sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results. Clinical isolates were identified as F. novicida based on sequence analyses of the 16S ribosomal RNA, pgm, and pdpD genes. PmeI PFGE patterns for the clinical isolates were indistinguishable. Source patients were aged 40–56 years, male, and African American, and all were immunocompromised. Two patients presented with signs of bacterial peritonitis; the third had pyomyositis of the thigh. The 3 inmates had no contact with one another; their only shared exposures were consumption of municipal water and of ice that was mass-produced at the prison in an unenclosed building. Swabs from one set of ice machines and associated ice scoops yielded evidence of F. novicida by PCR and sequencing. All other environmental specimens tested negative. Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported common-source outbreak of F. novicida infections in humans. Epidemiological and laboratory evidence implicate contaminated ice as the likely vehicle of transmission; liver disease may be a predisposing factor. Clinicians, laboratorians, and public health officials should be aware of the potential for misidentification of F. novicida as F. tularensis.

N2  - Studies have demonstrated that self-report tools can be used to reliably and validly examine psychopathic-like traits in adolescents. However, it is unclear if self-report instruments are still reliable and valid when confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, such as during routine assessments in juvenile detention centres. To address this issue, the current study used data from the routine mental health screening of 365 detained male adolescents (12–18 years) in two juvenile detention centres. With the intention of gaining insight in the clinical usefulness of self-reported psychopathic-like traits, we examined relations known from literature with emotional and behavioural features. Self-reported psychopathic-like traits, measured by the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory-Short version (YPI-S), were uniquely associated with substance abuse, anger/irritability, conduct problems and hyperactivity, but not with internalizing problems. YPI-S-dimensions showed several specific relationships with variables of interest. For example, only the callous unemotional dimension was negatively related with prosocial behaviour and only the behavioural dimension was positively related with hyperactivity. In conclusion, self-reported psychopathic-like traits showed expected relations with relevant variables. These findings suggest that self-report can be used to identify detained youths with high levels of psychopathic-like traits outside a research context, thus, even when anonymity and confidentiality are not guaranteed.

N2  - Statins are a class of low molecular weight drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
reductase. Statins have been approved and effectively used to control hypercholesterolemia in clinical setting. Recent study
showed statin's antitumor activity and suggested a potential role for prevention of human cancers. In this study, we did cell
viability, DNA fragmentation, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays to evaluate
the action of statins on prostate cancer cells and used Western blotting and RhoA activation assay to investigate the underlying
molecular mechanism of action. Our data showed that lovastatin and simvastatin effectively decreased cell viability in three
prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, and LnCap) by inducing apoptosis and cell growth arrest at G 1 phase. Both lovastatin and simvastatin induced activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and, to a lesser extent, caspase-9. Both
statins suppressed expression of Rb, phosphorylated Rb, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6, but induced p21 and p27 expression
in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, lovastatin and simvastatin suppressed RhoA activation and c-JUN expression, but not
cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Our data showed that the antitumor activity of statins is due to induction of apoptosis and cell
growth arrest. The underlying molecular mechanism of statin's action is mediated through inactivation of RhoA, which in turn
induces caspase enzymatic activity and/or G 1 cell cycle. Future studies should focus on examining statins and other apoptosis-inducing drugs (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors
or curcumin) together to assess their efficacy in prevention of prostate cancer. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2008;17(1):88–94)

N2  - Background:  Although prior studies have shown that detained females are marked by significant adverse circumstances, little is known about their adult outcomes.
Method:  Prospective follow‐up study of 184 (80.4% of original sample of 229) detained adolescent females who were reassessed 4.5 (SD = 0.6) years later in young adulthood (mean age = 20.0, SD = 1.4) on mental health and adjustment outcomes. Associations between these outcomes and detained females’ behavior problems and offense history were examined.
Results:  In the total sample, 59.0% had one or more mental health problems at follow‐up, whereas 96.2% were facing at least one adjustment problem. Subjects with a personality disorder (PD) reported more adjustment problems compared to subjects without PD. Mental health and adjustment problems in young adulthood were predicted by detained adolescent females’ behavior problems and offense history.
Conclusion:  Detained adolescent females suffered from multiple mental health and adjustment problems in young adulthood. Females who developed PD were most impaired. Results of this study underline the compelling need for continued and gender‐specific interventions. The identification of predictors during detention for poor adult outcomes can serve as targets for intervention.

N2  - Abstract The relationship between engagement in outpatient treatment facilities in the public sector and subsequent arrest is examined for clients in Connecticut, New York, Oklahoma and Washington. Engagement is defined as receiving another treatment service within 14 days of beginning a new episode of specialty treatment and at least two additional services within the next 30 days. Data are from 2008 and survival analysis modeling is used. Survival analyses express the effects of model covariates in terms of “hazard ratios,” which reflect a change in the likelihood of outcome because of the covariate. Engaged clients had a significantly lower hazard of any arrest than non-engaged in all four states. In NY and OK, engaged clients also had a lower hazard of arrest for substance-related crimes. In CT, NY, and OK engaged clients had a lower hazard of arrest for violent crime. Clients in facilities with higher engagement rates had a lower hazard of any arrest in NY and OK. Engaging clients in outpatient treatment is a promising approach to decrease their subsequent criminal justice involvement.

N2  - Injection drug use accounts for most of the incident infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States and other developed countries. HCV infection is a complex and challenging medical condition in injection drug users (IDUs). Elements of care for hepatitis C in illicit drug users include prevention counseling and education; screening for transmission risk behavior; testing for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus infection; vaccination against hepatitis A and B viruses; evaluation for comorbidities; coordination of substance-abuse treatment services, psychiatric care, and social support; evaluation of liver disease; and interferon-based treatment for HCV infection. Caring for patients who use illicit drugs presents challenges to the health-care team that require patience, experience, and an understanding of the dynamics of substance use and addiction. Nonetheless, programs are successfully integrating hepatitis C care for IDUs into health-care settings, including primary care, methadone treatment and other substance-abuse treatment programs, infectious disease clinics, and clinics in correctional facilities.

N2  - Objective: This article assessed work-to-family conflict (W-FC) and family-to-work conflict (F-WC) and their impact on depression among corrections officers in two correctional facilities in the United States. Methods: The sample consisted of 220 officers who completed questionnaires that included data on demographics, sense of coherence (SOC), physical health, psychosocial job characteristics, and work-family conflict. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) assessed depression. Results: The mean CES-D score was 7.8 (SD = 5.2); 31% had scores of 10 or more, indicative of serious psychological distress. The SOC, W-FC, and F-WC were significantly and positively associated with depression; W-FC mediated the effects of SOC on depression. Psychosocial job characteristics were not related to depression. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms were high among officers, and W-FC was a critical factor contributing to psychological distress.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To examine the long‐term impact of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) on mortality, re‐incarceration and hepatitis C seroconversion in imprisoned male heroin users.
Design, setting and participants  The study cohort comprised 382 imprisoned male heroin users who had participated in a randomized controlled trial of prison‐based MMT in 1997/98. Subjects were followed‐up between 1998 and 2002 either in the general community or in prison.
Measurements  All‐cause mortality, re‐incarceration, hepatitis C and HIV serostatus and MMT retention.
Findings  There were no deaths recorded while subjects were enrolled in MMT. Seventeen subjects died while out of MMT, representing an untreated mortality rate of 2.0 per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 1.2–3.2). Re‐incarceration risk was lowest during MMT episodes of 8 months or longer (adjusted hazard ratio 0.3 (95% CI, 0.2–0.5; P < 0.001), although MMT periods 2 months or less were associated with greatest risk of re‐incarceration (P < 0.001). Increased risk of hepatitis C seroconversion was significantly associated with prison sentences of less than 2 months [adjusted hazard ratio 20 (95% CI, 5–76; < P = 0.001)] and MMT episodes less than 5 months [adjusted hazard ratio 4.2 (95% CI, 1.4–12.6; P = 0.01)]. Subjects were at greatest risk of MMT dropout during short prison sentences of 1 month or less (adjusted hazard ratio 10.4 (95% CI, 7.0–15.7; P < 0.001). HIV incidence was 0.3 per 100 person‐years (95% CI, 0.03–0.99).
Conclusions  Retention in MMT was associated with reduced mortality, re‐incarceration rates and hepatitis C infection. Prison‐based MMT programmes are integral to the continuity of treatment needed to ensure optimal outcomes for individual and public health.

N2  - Abstract The present study links an empirically-developed quantitative measure of gender-sensitive (GS) substance abuse treatment to arrest outcomes among 5109 substance abusing women in mixed-gender short-term residential programs in Washington State. Frailty models of survival analysis and three-level hierarchical linear models were conducted to test the beneficial effects of GS treatment on decreasing criminal justice involvement. Propensity scores were used to control for the pre-existing differences among women due to the quasi-experimental nature of the study. Men's arrest outcomes were used to control for confounding at the program level. Results show that women in more GS treatment programs had a lower risk of drug-related arrests, and women in more GS treatment programs who also completed treatment had a significant reduction in overall arrests from 2 years before- to 2 years after treatment, above and beyond the reduction in arrests due to treatment alone. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

N2  - Aims
To compare the incidence, timing and risk factors for substance‐related death between Indigenous and non‐Indigenous ex‐prisoners in Queensland, Australia.
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Setting
All adult prisons in the state of Queensland, Australia, linked to deaths registered in Australia.
Participants/cases
We obtained records for all adults released from prison in Queensland, Australia from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2007. Among this cohort of 42 015 individuals we observed 82 315 releases from prison and 2158 deaths in the community by the end of 2007, of which 661 were substance‐related deaths.
Measurements
Incarceration data were obtained from Queensland Corrective Services and linked probabilistically with deaths recorded in the Australian National Death Index.
Findings
In the first year after release, Indigenous ex‐prisoners were more likely to die from alcohol‐related causes [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1–3.1)] but less likely to die of drug‐related causes (HR = 0.34, 95%CI = 0.21–0.53) than were non‐Indigenous ex‐prisoners. Among non‐Indigenous prisoners only, the risk of substance‐related death was significantly higher in the first 4 weeks [relative risk (RR) = 5.1, 95% CI = 3.7–6.9] when compared with the risk after 1 year post‐release. Most evaluated risk factors for substance‐related death were similar for Indigenous and non‐Indigenous ex‐prisoners; however, the hazard of death increased with age more for Indigenous ex‐prisoners (HR = 1.7 per decade of age, 95% CI = 1.4–2.1) than for non‐Indigenous ex‐prisoners (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2–1.4).
Conclusions
In Australia, patterns of substance‐related death in ex‐prisoners differ markedly according to Indigenous status. Efforts to prevent substance‐related deaths in ex‐prisoners should consider heterogeneity in the target population and tailor responses accordingly.

N2  - Background:  Children of prisoners are at increased risk of impaired health, behavioural problems and substance misuse; however, the causal pathways to these problems are unclear. Under some circumstances, parental imprisonment may result in improved outcomes for the child. This study investigates the impact of paternal arrest and imprisonment on child behaviour and substance use, as a function of child gender, and in the context of known social and familial risk factors.
Methods:  Longitudinal analysis of an Australian birth cohort (N = 2,399) recruited 1981–83, with child outcomes measured at age 14. Participants were recruited prenatally from a large, public hospital in Brisbane, Australia and followed up in the community. History of paternal arrest and imprisonment were based on maternal self‐report, at age 14. Outcome measures included mother‐ and child‐reported internalising and externalising behaviour (CBCL and YSR), and child self‐reported alcohol and tobacco use.
Results:  In univariate analyses, paternal imprisonment was associated with maternal reports of increased child internalising (OR = 1.82, 95%CI 1.08–3.06) and externalising (OR = 2.24, 95%CI 1.41–3.57), and alcohol use (OR = 1.68, 95%CI 1.11–2.53) at age 14. However, controlling for socio‐economic status, maternal mental health and substance use, parenting style and family adjustment, these associations became non‐significant. For boys only, in the multivariate model paternal arrest but not imprisonment predicted alcohol (OR = 1.79, 95%CI 1.09–2.95) and tobacco (OR = 1.83, 95%CI 1.03–3.25) use at age 14.
Conclusions:  The association between paternal arrest and imprisonment and adverse outcomes in adolescence is accounted for by well‐established social and familial risk factors. Paternal imprisonment may not, in itself, increase the risk for child behaviour and substance use problems.

N2  - Medicaid is an important source of health care coverage for prison-involved populations. From 2011 to 2012, we surveyed state prison system (SPS) policies affecting Medicaid enrollment during incarceration and upon release; 42 of 50 SPSs participated.
Upon incarceration, Medicaid benefits were suspended in 9 (21.4%) SPSs and terminated in 28 (66.7%); 27 (64.3%) SPSs screened prisoners for potential Medicaid eligibility.
Although many states supported Medicaid enrollment upon release, several did not. We have considered implications for Medicaid expansion.

N2  - Background
Cryoprecipitate may be used to treat bleeding in cardiac surgery. Its effects on plasma fibrinogen and fibrin clotting in this setting are poorly defined.
Study Design And Methods
Patients undergoing on‐pump aortic surgery with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) were recruited prospectively. After protamine reversal, cryoprecipitate was administered to patients with bleeding, and fibrin deficit was indicated by thromboelastometry (ROTEM)‐based FIBTEM test. Coagulation was assessed using ROTEM‐based tests and standard laboratory tests before and after cryoprecipitate.
Results
Thirteen patients were included. Cryoprecipitate significantly elevated EXTEM A10 from (mean ± standard deviation) 29.4 ± 5.8 to 34.8 ± 5.9 mm (p = 0.01), FIBTEM A10 from 3.5 ± 0.9 to 5.8 ± 1.7 mm (p = 0.04), and plasma fibrinogen concentration from 154.2 ± 25.6 to 193.4 ± 30.5 mg/dL (p = 0.01). EXTEM clot elasticity at 10 minutes (CE10) increased from 42.5 ± 12.0 to 54.7 ± 14.9 mm after cryoprecipitate (30.0% increase). FIBTEM CE10 increased from 3.7 ± 0.9 to 6.2 ± 2.0 mm (53.0% increase). A fibrinogen dose of 13.2 ± 5.2 mg/kg was required to increase FIBTEM A10 by 1 mm. In vivo recovery of fibrinogen was 61.6 ± 31.2%.
Conclusions
Cryoprecipitate increased plasma fibrinogen levels and fibrin‐based clotting in bleeding patients undergoing aortic surgery with DHCA. In vivo recovery of fibrinogen was considerably below 100% and fibrinogen content varied between cryoprecipitate units. Trials are needed to assess whether cryoprecipitate impacts clinical outcomes and to evaluate its safety.

N2  - In the last decade of the twentieth century, the century-long medical implementation of instruments and substances that cast forcible feeding as the carceral protocol to hunger striking was torqued and calibrated in the service of human metabolic research and then implemented in medical management protocols. While caring for hunger-striking prisoners who had been transferred to hospitals in 1989, South African university physicians documented clinical research of adult male metabolism under prolonged starvation and recovery. The metabolic functioning and care protocols they developed for managing individual bodies could also be applied more broadly and abstractly as population-wide norms. From their research,

BACKGROUND
Incarceration is associated with poor health and high costs. Given the dramatic growth in the criminal justice system’s population and associated expenses, inclusion of questions related to incarceration in national health data sets could provide essential data to researchers, clinicians and policy-makers.
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate a representative sample of publically available national health data sets for their ability to be used to study the health of currently or formerly incarcerated persons and to identify opportunities to improve criminal justice questions in health data sets.
DESIGN & APPROACH
We reviewed the 36 data sets from the Society of General Internal Medicine Dataset Compendium related to individual health. Through content analysis using incarceration-related keywords, we identified data sets that could be used to study currently or formerly incarcerated persons, and we identified opportunities to improve the availability of relevant data.
KEY RESULTS
While 12 (33%) data sets returned keyword matches, none could be used to study incarcerated persons. Three (8%) could be used to study the health of formerly incarcerated individuals, but only one data set included multiple questions such as length of incarceration and age at incarceration. Missed opportunities included: (1) data sets that included current prisoners but did not record their status (10, 28%); (2) data sets that asked questions related to incarceration but did not specifically record a subject’s status as formerly incarcerated (8, 22%); and (3) longitudinal studies that dropped and/or failed to record persons who became incarcerated during the study (8, 22%).
CONCLUSIONS
Few health data sets can be used to evaluate the association between incarceration and health. Three types of changes to existing national health data sets could substantially expand the available data, including: recording incarceration status for study participants who are incarcerated; recording subjects’ history of incarceration when this data is already being collected; and expanding incarceration-related questions in studies that already record incarceration history.

N2  - While the government struggles to restore economic health, some public officials may be tempted to act out in impulsive, unreflective ways, promoting highly punitive measures for their immediate symbolic and expressive value.3 The apparent surge in firearm purchases in early 2009 and the brazen display of weapons at public events - notably the town meetings called in Summer 2009 to discuss health care reform - are ominous indicators of growing public anxiety that may have important implications for penal policy and law enforcement. [...] focusing too heavily on the economic burden may draw attention away from the fact that the penal system has begun to fundamentally alter how key social and political institutions operate and to pervert what it means to be a citizen in the United States.30 It also undercuts the compelling civil- and human-rights arguments that the carcerai state raises as it removes wide swaths of African Americans, Latinos, and poor Americans from their neighborhoods.

N2  - Most California prisoners experience discontinuity of health care upon return to the community. In January 2006, physicians working with community organizations and representatives of the San Francisco Department of Public Health's safety-net health system opened the Transitions Clinic (TC) to provide transitional and primary care as well as case management for prisoners returning to San Francisco. This article provides a complete description of TC, including an illustrative case, and reports information about the recently released individuals who participated in the program. From January 2006 to October 2007, TC saw 185 patients with chronic medical conditions. TC patients are socially and economically disenfranchised; 86% belong to ethnic minority groups and 38% are homeless. Eighty-nine percent of patients did not have a primary care provider prior to their incarceration. Preliminary findings demonstrate that a community-based model of care tailored to this disenfranchised population successfully engages them in seeking health care.

N2  - This book presents contemporary feminist approaches to key issues in criminal justice. It draws together key researchers from Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand to offer a context-specific textbook that covers all of the major debates in the discipline in an accessible way.
This book examines both the foundational texts and cutting-edge contributions to the topic and acknowledges the unique challenges and debates in the local Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand context. Written as an entry-level text, it introduces undergraduate students to key theories, research and and debates on the topics of offending, victimisation and the criminal justice system. It explores key topics in feminist criminology with chapters exploring sex work, prison abolitionism, community punishment, media representations of crime and victims, and the impacts of digital technology on gendered violence. Centring on an intersectional approach, the book includes chapters that focus on disability, queer criminology, Indigenous perspectives, migration and service-user perspectives. The book concludes by exploring future directions in feminist approaches to crime and justice.
This textbook will be essential reading for undergraduates and researchers studying feminist criminology, gender and crime, queer criminology, sociolegal studies, intersectionality, sociology and criminal justice.

N2  - “Necropolitics” denotes powerful processes that segment populations into those whose lives are valued and those who are exposed to death. The term is often used to go beyond analyses narrowly focused on “biopolitics,” i.e., the government and furthering of the life of the population. Instead, the notion of necropolitics centers governmental practices and rationalities that expose certain groups to premature death, whether through direct killing and slaughter or through abandonment and slow violence. Achille Mbembe introduced the term. In his homonymous essay, Mbembe emphasizes the emergence of sovereign power in modernity through colonial capitalism and the slave plantation to draw attention to the persistence in the contemporary world of racialized dehumanization and militarized “terror formations” that cast those deprived of biopolitical care into liminal “death-worlds.” In geography and cognate disciplines, the bulk of writings on necropolitics examine uneven social and spatial formations and associated governing technologies that rely on violence, bordering, confinement, and abandonment. While a main focus has been on racialization, anti-blackness, and Black resistance, various authors also scrutinize the role of gender, sexuality, dis/ability, intersectionality, and more-than-human necropolitics. In doing so, authors consider a range of sites, scales, and spatialities. Most prominently, this includes the camp, zones of exception, and the plantation. These are examined, on the one hand, as locales of deadly violence and, on the other, as contested topologies that subsist across social realms at local and global scales. Likewise, various works engage with prisons and borders as well as carceral spaces and border regimes. Some authors discuss violence-based displacement and dispossession in geopolitical contexts of imperialism, settler-colonialism, resource conflicts, and war, or how globalized capitalist accumulation and extraction create so-called surplus populations and landscapes of waste and toxicity. Urban and political geographers discuss the necropolitical governance of cities, for instance in connection to exclusionary housing politics or militarized, racist, and anti-poor policing in city centers and peripheries. Moreover, attention has been drawn to “deathscapes” and undignified sites of dying and interment, including in oceans, deserts, or “potter’s fields,” as well as practices of commemoration, survival, and resistance emerging in deadly contexts. Finally, some works interrogate the conceptual foundations of necropolitics and discuss methodological challenges arising from doing research in the presence or aftermath of destruction and death. Taken together, debates in geography and cognate fields have generated a rich vocabulary that expands our understanding of deadly power, including notions of “necropolitical governance,” “necrogeopolitics,” “necro-subjection,” “necroviolence,” “necropolis,” “necroburbia,” “necrosettlements,” “necrolandscaping,” and “necroresistance.”

N2  - The critical question posed by Cheshire West and its aftermath is why are we invoking this classical carceral-era legal machinery at the height of the post-carceral era, and in places far beyond the reaches of the ‘institution’? What ‘problem-space’ (Scott, 2004) shaped the litigation strategies that led to DoLS and its later expansion? Why were problems framed in terms of ‘deprivation of liberty’, and not some other form, inviting an alternative regulatory response? Why, indeed, turn to law at all?

N2  - Background:The prevalence of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is higher among prison inmates compared with the general population because of the high proportion of injecting drug users (IDU).Methods:A meta-analysis of studies on HCV infection in the correctional system was performed. The main objective was to analyse risk factors for HCV infection and to assess HCV seroprevalence and incidence in prison.Results:Thirty studies were included in the meta-analysis on HCV prevalence. IDU were approximately 24 times more likely than non-IDU to be HCV positive. The odds ratio of being HCV positive was three times higher for inmates exposed to tattooing than those not exposed. The odds ratio among women was 1.44 compared with men.Conclusions:The differences in HCV seroprevalence among studies can largely be explained by differences in the proportion of inmates who are IDU and partly by differences in seroprevalence among IDU in the community. Tattooing and female gender were also associated with HCV positivity. These findings should be taken into account when planning prevention activities in prisons.

N2  - Background: Studies of the prison population suggest that the numbers of prisoners with language and communication disorders is higher than that of the overall population. However, the prison population is heterogeneous and it is important to focus on specific areas of the population. This study focuses on juvenile offenders.
Aims: The study aimed to screen language and communication skills in half the population of an establishment for juvenile offenders aged 15-17 years.
Methods & Procedures: A total of 58 participants were selected at random and screened on the oral subtests of the Test of Adolescent and Adult Language, 3rd Edn (TOAL-3), the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS-II) and the Test for Reception of Grammar: Version 2 (TROG-2). Literacy and numeracy information was also obtained.
Outcomes & Results: The mean age of the group was 17 years; 19 were looked-after children; and 90% had ceased to attend school before age 16. On the TOAL-3 subtests, 66-90% of juvenile offenders in the sample had below average language skills, with 46-67% of these being in the poor or very poor group. None of the participants reached their age equivalence on the BPVS, but most of them reached the 12-year and above threshold on the TROG. A total of 62% of the sample had not achieved Level 1 in literacy. The findings suggest that these young people may not have the necessary skills to cope with verbally mediated interventions aimed at reducing re-offending.
Conclusions: The results suggest that speech and language therapy assessment should be available to juvenile offenders with speech and language therapy intervention available to those found to have language and communication difficulties. There are also implications for speech and language therapy provision to young people who are not engaged within the education system. The TOAL-3 appears to be a useful screening instrument for this population, but a number of issues around the suitability of assessments for this population are discussed.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Despite no federal law mandating Medicaid termination for prisoners, 90 percent of states have implemented policies that withdraw inmates’ enrollment upon incarceration. This leaves a medically and psychiatrically vulnerable population uninsured during the months following release, a time period during which former inmates have been shown to have an increased risk of medical problems and death. We believe it is of critical importance for the 10 million Americans who cycle in and out of corrections each year, as well as the communities they return to, that Medicaid be suspended rather than terminated during incarceration.

N2  - Elizabeth Hinton’s From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime is an important contribution to the scholarship on the carceral state. While authors such as Michelle Alexander have traced the origin of mass incarceration to the War on Drugs, Hinton convincingly argues the modern era of mass incarceration originated not with tough-on-crime policies associated with the conservative backlash to the civil rights movement -- beginning with President Nixon’s law-and-order politics and culminating in President Reagan’s War on Drugs -- but with the liberal Johnson administration. With the passage of the Law Enforcement Assistance Act (LEAA) in September of 1965, President Johnson would launch the War on Crime -- little more than a year into the War on Poverty. The LEAA, inspired in part by the Watts riot, provided funding to modernize local law enforcement, equipping urban police departments with technologies and tactics that had previously been reserved for the military or federal law enforcement.

N2  - BackgroundWe examined the experiences of incarcerated adolescent males (N=29) who participated in a one-day meditation retreat and 10-week meditation programme.
MethodSelf-report surveys assessing mindfulness, self-regulation, impulsivity and stress; behavioural assessments; and focus group data were examined.
ResultsWe observed significantly higher scores in self-regulation (p=.012) and psychometric markers demonstrated psychological enhancement. No behavioural change was observed. Six themes emerged: enhanced well-being, increased self-discipline, increased social cohesiveness, expanded self-awareness, resistance to meditation and future meditation practice.
ConclusionsEarly evidence suggests that meditation training for incarcerated youth is a feasible and promising intervention.
Key Practitioner Message This is the first published mixed-methods study on a meditation intervention for incarcerated youth Key quantitative findings were that the meditation programme was associated with a significant increase in self-regulation but no behavioural change was observed Themes identified from focus groups described benefits commonly attributed to meditation as well as challenges with meditation Early evidence suggests that meditation interventions for incarcerated youth are feasible, not harmful and may provide benefit While participating incarcerated youth overall reported positive experiences with the meditation programme, the long-term benefits remain unknown

N2  - The number of older prisoners is increasing exponentially. For example, the number of geriatric female prisoners in California has increased 350% in the past decade. Despite an increasing population of geriatric female prisoners, the degree of functional impairment in this population is unknown. Therefore, the goals of this study were to describe the prevalence and nature of functional impairment in geriatric female prisoners in California and to identify aspects of the prison environment that may exacerbate functional impairments.
Questionnaires were analyzed from 120 geriatric women in California state prisons. Functional impairment was defined as impairment in activities of daily living (ADLs) or in prison ADLs (PADLs), including dropping to the floor for alarms, standing for count, getting to meals, hearing orders, and climbing onto the top bunk. The mean age of participants was 62; 16% were dependent in one ADL, and 69% reported one PADL impairment. Increasing severity of functional impairment was associated with worse health status and more adverse prison experiences. For example, fall rates ranged from 33% in women without impairment to 57% with PADL impairment to 63% with ADL dependence (P=.02). Several prison environmental stressors were identified that likely exacerbate functional impairment. For example, 29% of geriatric women were assigned to a top bunk.
Geriatric female prisoners report high rates of functional impairment. ADL and PADL impairment were associated with worse health status and adverse prison experiences. Therefore, the evaluation of functional impairment in geriatric female prisoners needs to consider the unique demands of the prison environment.

N2  - This study explored the prevalence and related risk behaviors for hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among a sample of male injection drug users (IDUs) in Arak, Iran. One hundred male IDUs attending methadone maintenance clinics between April and September 2012 were enrolled and evaluated for HCV, HBV, and HIV infection. The majority of study participants (56%) had evidence of HCV exposure, 6% had evidence of HBV, and 19% were HIV-infected. Coinfections were frequent; 15% had evidence of HIV and HCV, 6% had evidence of HBV and HCV, and 5% had serologic markers for all three infections. Most (84%) were susceptible to HBV infection. A history of any syringe sharing (54%) and syringe sharing in prison (25%) were common. In bivariate analyses, a history of any syringe sharing and syringe sharing in prison were both associated with all three viral infections. The high prevalence of HCV, HBV, HIV, and coinfections among IDU in Arak is concerning and indicates rapid disease spread outside of Iran's main urban centers. Prevention efforts should expand vaccination for IDUs who are nonimmune to HBV and continue to target syringe sharing with efforts such as needle exchange programs, including inside prisons.

N2  - The policies of mass incarceration and the expansion of the criminal justice system in the USA over the last 40 years have weighed heavily on individuals and communities impacted by drug use and HIV disease. Though less than ideal, jails provide a unique opportunity to diagnose, treat and implement effective interventions. The role of jails in HIV detection, treatment, and continuity of care, however, has yet to be systematically examined. This paper reviews the service strategies and contexts for 10 demonstration sites funded to develop innovative methods for providing care and treatment to HIV-infected individuals in jail settings who are returning to their communities. The sites have implemented varied intervention strategies; each set in unique policy and service system contexts. Collaboration among agencies and between systems to implement these interventions is viewed as particularly challenging undertakings. We anticipate the sites will collectively serve 700-1000 individuals across the duration of the initiative. In this paper, we review the service contexts and strategies developed by the 10 sites. The individual and multi-site evaluations aim to provide new data on testing, treatment, and community linkages from jails that will further develop our knowledge base on effective intervention strategies in these settings.

Strategies to reduce S. aureus transmission will need to consider the high frequency of throat colonization.

N2  - Aim
To evaluate the efficacy of nortriptyline (NOR) added to a multi‐component smoking cessation intervention, which included cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) and provision of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).
Design
Randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two study groups with blinded follow‐up at 3, 6 and 12 months. Both groups received a multi‐component smoking cessation intervention comprising two half‐hour individual sessions of CBT and NRT with either active NOR or placebo.
Setting
Prisons in New South Wales (17) and Queensland (one), Australia.
Participants
A total of 425 male prisoners met inclusion criteria and were allocated to either treatment (n = 206) or control group (n = 219).
Measurements
Primary end‐points at 3, 6 and 12 months were continuous abstinence, point prevalence abstinence and reporting a 50% reduction in smoking. Smoking status was confirmed by expired carbon monoxide, using a cut‐point of ≤10 parts per million.
Findings
Participants' demographics and baseline tobacco use were similar in treatment and control groups. Based on an intention‐to‐treat analysis, continuous abstinence between the treatment and control groups was not significantly different at 3 months (23.8 versus 16.4%), 6 months (17.5 versus 12.3%) and 12 months (11.7 versus 11.9%).
Conclusion
Adding nortriptyline to a smoking cessation treatment package consisting of behavioural support and nicotine replacement therapy does not appear to improve long‐term abstinence rates in male prisoners.

N2  - Each year, more than 10 million people enter US jails, most returning home within a few weeks. Because jails concentrate people with infectious and chronic diseases, substance abuse, and mental health problems, and reentry policies often exacerbate these problems, the experiences of people leaving jail may contribute to health inequities in the low-income communities to which they return.
Our study of the experiences in the year after release of 491 adolescent males and 476 adult women returning home from New York City jails shows that both populations have low employment rates and incomes and high rearrest rates. Few received services in jail. However, overall drug use and illegal activity declined significantly in the year after release. Postrelease employment and health insurance were associated with lower rearrest rates and drug use. Public policies on employment, drug treatment, housing, and health care often blocked successful reentry into society from jail, suggesting the need for new policies that support successful reentry into society.

N2  - BACKGROUND—We investigated the effects of cardioplegic arrest and reperfusion (CP/Rep) on myocardial apoptosis and key apoptotic mediators, such as apoptosis-inducing factor, caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins, and protein kinase C (PKC), in uncontrolled type 2 diabetic, controlled type 2 diabetic, and nondiabetic patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS—Right atrial tissue was harvested pre- and post-CP/Rep from uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients (hemoglobin A1c=9.6±0.25), controlled type 2 diabetic patients (hemoglobin A1c=6.5±0.15), and nondiabetic patients (hemoglobin A1c=5.4±0.12) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n=8/group). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining was used for the identification of apoptotic cells. Total and modified apoptosis-inducing factor, Bcl-2 family proteins, phospho-PKC-α, phospho-PKC-β1, and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase were quantified by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry. At baseline, the number of apoptotic cells and expression of total apoptosis-inducing factor, Bcl-2, Bak, and Bax in the pre-CP/Rep atrial tissue from uncontrolled type 2 diabetic patients were significantly increased compared with those of nondiabetic or controlled type 2 diabetic patients (P<0.05). After CP/Rep, the amount of apoptotic cells, apoptosis-inducing factor, phospho-Bad, phospho-PKC-α, phospho-PKC-β1, and cleaved poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase in post-CP/Rep atrial tissue were increased in all 3 groups compared with pre-CP/Rep. These increases after CP/Rep were more pronounced in the uncontrolled type 2 diabetic group. In addition, there were significant increases in the expression of cleaved caspase 8 and caspase 9 in the basal and post-CP/Rep atrium of uncontrolled type 2 diabetic group compared with nondiabetic or controlled type 2 diabetic group.
CONCLUSIONS—Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is associated with increases in myocardial apoptosis and expression of key apoptosis mediators at baseline and in the setting of CP/Rep.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To determine whether collaborative behavioral management (CBM) reduces substance use, crime and re‐arrest among drug‐involved parolees.
Design  Step'n Out was a randomized behavioral trial of CBM versus standard parole (SP) during 2004–08. CBM adapted evidence‐based role induction, behavioral contracting and contingent reinforcement to provide parole officer/treatment counselor dyads with positive tools in addition to sanctions to manage parolees' behavior over 12 weeks.
Setting  Six parole offices in five states in the USA.
Participants  Parolee volunteers with a mandate for addiction treatment and a minimum of 3 months of parole (n = 476). Follow‐up was 94% at 3 months and 86% at 9 months.
Measurements  Drug use and crime in a given month from calendar interviews 3 and 9 months after parole initiation, and re‐arrests from criminal justice administrative data.
Findings  The CBM group had fewer months in which they used their primary drug [adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05, 0.78, P = 0.02] and alcohol (ARR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.66, P = 0.006) over follow‐up. CBM had its greatest effects among parolees who reported marijuana or another ‘non‐hard’ drug as their primary drug; parolees who preferred stimulants or opiates did not benefit. No differences were seen in total crime, re‐arrests or parole revocations.
Conclusions  Collaborative behavioral management may reduce substance use among primary marijuana or other ‘non‐hard’ drug‐using parolees without increasing revocations. Because the majority of drug violation arrests in the United States are for marijuana, these findings have important implications for the management of a substantial proportion of the US community correctional population.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Reports of increased rates of psychosis in prisons could be due to sampling and ascertainment differences. The authors compared two samples of subjects 16-64 years of age: those from the general population of residents in Great Britain and prisoners in England and Wales. METHOD: A random sample of remanded and sentenced male and female prisoners (N=3,142) and a two-phase, cross-sectional random sample of household residents (N=10,108) were assessed with structured questionnaires and the semistructured Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of probable functional psychosis in the past year was 4.5 per thousand (95% CI=3.1 to 5.8) in the household survey. In the prison survey, the weighted prevalence was over 10 times greater: 52 per thousand (95% CI=45 to 60). One in four prisoners with a psychotic disorder had psychotic symptoms attributed to toxic or withdrawal effects of psychoactive substances. The proportion of subjects with specific types of hallucinations or delusions did not differ between prison and household psychosis cases. CONCLUSIONS: This large study using standardized comparisons showed that the prevalence of psychosis in prisons is substantially higher than in the community and is deserving of greater attention to treatment and prevention. Apart from a minority of prisoners with symptoms attributable to psychoactive substances, the clinical symptom profile of psychosis is the same in both settings. Longitudinal research is needed to better understand these prevalence differences.

N2  - Abstract Persons who abuse or are dependent on opioids are at elevated risk for arrest. Co-occurring behavioral health problems may exacerbate that risk, although the extent of any such increase has not been described. This study examines such risk factors among 40,238 individuals with a diagnosis of opioid abuse or dependence who were enrolled in the Massachusetts Medicaid program in 2010. Medicaid data were merged with statewide arrest data to assess the effects of co-existing mental illness, substance abuse, and previous arrests on arrest during 2010. Persons with serious mental illnesses (psychotic and bipolar disorders) and those with two or more pre-2010 arrests had significantly increased greater odds of arrest. We believe this to be the first study examining effects of co-occurring risk factors on arrest in a large population with opioid dependency/abuse. These findings identify predictors of arrest that could be used to design interventions targeting specific co-occurring risk factors.

N2  - Background.Incarcerated populations are at high risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, yet prisoners are not routinely screened or treated for HCV infection. Understanding the risk factors of HCV infection among prisoners could help improve HCV interventions. Methods.Prevalence and risk of HCV infection among 469 prisoners entering California State correctional facilities were assessed using HCV antibody screening, HCV RNA measurement, and structured interviews. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent correlates of HCV infection. Results.The prevalence of HCV infection was 34.3% overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%–38%) and was 65.7% among those with a history of injection drug use (IDU), compared with 10.2% among those with no history of IDU (odds ratio [OR], 17.24; 95% CI, 10.52–28.25). Significant differences in HCV antibody positivity were found in association with age at first detention but not with the nature of the crime. Independent correlates of HCV infection included age, history of IDU, cumulative time of incarceration, biological sex (OR for females subjects compared with males subjects, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.96), and a history of having sex with a male IDU (OR, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.46–13.37). We identified significant differences in risk factors between male and female subjects—notably, that the risk of HCV infection was significantly elevated among female non-IDUs who reported having sexual partners with a history of IDU. Among non-IDUs, correlates of HCV infection included history of receipt of blood products and cumulative years of incarceration. Conclusions.HCV infection is pervasive among the California prison population, including prisoners who are non-IDUs and women with high-risk sexual behavior. These results should promote consideration of routine HCV antibody screening and behavioral interventions among incarcerated men and women.

N2  - •We examine brain responses during moral judgment in youth with psychopathic traits.•Conduct disorder symptoms negatively predicted anterior temporal responses.•Callous–unemotional traits negatively predicted amygdala-moral rating associations.•Brain dysfunction patterns during moral judgment vary by psychopathic trait type.
Neuroimaging studies have found that adult male psychopaths show reduced engagement of limbic and paralimbic circuitry while making moral judgments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether these findings extend to adolescent males with psychopathic traits. Functional MRI was used to record hemodynamic activity in 111 incarcerated male adolescents while they viewed unpleasant pictures that did or did not depict moral transgressions and rated each on “moral violation severity”. Adolescents were assessed for psychopathic traits using the Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Version (PCL-YV), Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL) Conduct Disorder supplement, and Inventory of Callous and Unemotional Traits-Youth Version (ICU-Y). While viewing pictures depicting moral transgressions, CD scores were negatively correlated with hemodynamic responses in the anterior temporal cortex. Adolescents scoring low on the ICU-Y showed a positive correlation between right amygdala responses and severity of violation ratings; those with high ICU-Y scores showed a negative correlation. While viewing unpleasant pictures with and without moral transgressions, PCL-YV scores were negatively correlated with hemodynamic responses in the left amygdala. Overall, the results are consistent with those previously found in adult male psychopaths, but vary depending on the type of psychopathy assessment.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To identify factors associated with receptive syringe sharing among injection drug users (IDUs) and elucidate the association between syringe possession arrests and syringe sharing.
Design  Cross‐sectional study.
Setting  Mexican border cities of Tijuana, Baja California and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.
Participants  IDUs in Tijuana (n = 222) and Ciudad Juarez (n = 206) were recruited using respondent‐driven sampling (RDS). IDUs were ≥ 18 years and had injected illicit drugs in the past month.
Measurements  An interviewer‐administered survey was used to collect quantitative data on socio‐demographic, behavioral and contextual characteristics, including self‐reported syringe sharing and arrests for syringe possession. Associations with receptive syringe sharing were investigated using logistic regression with RDS adjustment.
Findings  Overall, 48% of participants reported ever being arrested for carrying an unused/sterile syringe, even though syringe purchase and possession is legal in Mexico. Arrest for possessing unused/sterile syringes was associated independently with receptive syringe sharing [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.05; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 3.35], as was injecting in a shooting gallery (AOR = 3.60; 95% CI: 2.21, 5.87), injecting in the street (AOR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.18, 3.54) and injecting methamphetamine (AOR = 2.77; 95% CI: 1.41, 5.47) or cocaine (AOR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.36). More than half of participants (57%) had been arrested for possessing a used syringe; in a second model, arrest for used syringe possession was also associated independently with receptive sharing (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.76, 4.69).
Conclusions  We documented high levels of syringe‐related arrests in two Mexican–US border cities and an independent association between these arrests and risky injection practices. Public health collaborations with law enforcement to modify the risk environment in which drug use occurs are essential to facilitate safer injection practices.

N2  - In Discipline and Punish, Foucault outlines the emergence of a "carceral society," based on modern disciplinary institutions exemplified by the Panopticon, which individualize and embody discipline in novel forms. Among the most salient aspects of disciplinary institutions is that they establish an unequal gaze, in which subjects feel themselves to be under constant observation by an unseen seer, conveying the sentiment of an invisible omniscience. In this paper I suggest that institutions like the Panopticon represent only one among many structures of surveillance—that the question of who is understood to be gazing at whom, by what means, and with what effects, is an important issue for anthropological investigation. I illustrate this argument by drawing ethnographic materials circa 1950 from the Chachapoyas region of northern Peru, where government repression forced a political party called APRA to seek refuge underground. Despite the fact that APRA was forced to operate in secret, beyond the gaze of the authorities, the party precipitated a crisis of rule among government officials, convincing them that they were incapable of carrying out even the most basic of governing functions. Although APRA had nothing even remotely resembling disciplinary institutions at its command, the party nonetheless managed to create its own sentiment of invisible omniscience, and to convince government officials that they were subject to it. I draw on these developments to argue that there are many different modes or technologies of surveillance, each of which reflects specific social conditions, and which produces distinctive ways of ruling at a distance.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to develop a detailed description of the variety of jail release patterns and to learn what factors affect the length of stay (LOS).
Methods. The main data set for the study came from a biennial Bureau of Justice Statistics survey on felony defendants in large urban counties.
Results. The median LOS for the felony defendants was 7 days. One quarter of the jails had a median LOS of less than 2 days; median LOS for 75% of the jails was less than 15 days. Median regression showed that male gender, previous arrests, and violent charges were predictive of longer LOS.
Conclusions. The diversity in release patterns among jails has not been previously described. A public health intervention feasible in one jail may not be feasible in another because of the heterogeneity of release patterns. Individual inmate characteristics could predict a slower rate of release.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To assess if 15–35‐year‐old males released after 14 + days’ imprisonment in Scotland, 1996–99, had a higher drugs‐related death rate in 2 weeks after release than during subsequent 10 weeks; higher than expected death rate from other causes; and if drugs‐related deaths in the first fortnight were three times as many as prison suicides.
Design  Confidential linkage of ex‐prisoner database against deaths.
Setting  Scotland's male prisons and young offenders’ institutions during July to December 1996–99; 19 486 index releases after 14+ days’ incarceration.
Measurements  Relative risk of drugs‐related death in the first 2 weeks after release (34 deaths) versus subsequent 10 weeks (23). Other causes of death (21) relative to expectation. Drugs‐related deaths in first 2 weeks after release relative to suicides in prison (12).
Findings  Drugs‐related mortality in 1996–99 was seven times higher (95% CI: 3.3–16.3) in the 2 weeks after release than at other times at liberty and 2.8 times higher than prison suicides (95% CI: 1.5–3.5) by males aged 15–35 years who had been incarcerated for 14+ days. We estimated one drugs‐related death in the 2 weeks after release per 200 adult male injectors released from 14 + days’ incarceration. Non‐drugs‐related deaths in the 12 weeks after release were 4.9 times (95% CI: 2.8–7.0) the 4.3 deaths expected.
Conclusion  Investment in, and evaluation of, prison‐based interventions is needed to reduce substantially recently released drugs‐related deaths.

N2  - Objectives. Women in correctional institutions have substantial reproductive health problems, yet they are underserved in receipt of reproductive health care. We assessed the level of risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the reproductive health needs of 484 incarcerated women in Rhode Island to plan an intervention for women returning to the community.
Methods. We used a 45-minute survey to assess medical histories, pregnancy and birth control use histories, current pregnancy intentions, substance use during the past 3 months, histories of childhood sexual abuse, and health attitudes and behaviors.
Results. Participants had extremely high risks for STDs and pregnancy, which was characterized by inconsistent birth control (66.5%) and condom use (80.4%), multiple partners (38%), and a high prevalence of unplanned pregnancies (83.6%) and STDs (49%). Only 15.4% said it was not likely that they would have sexual relations with a man within 6 months after release.
Conclusion. Reproductive health services must be offered to incarcerated women. Such interventions will benefit the women, the criminal justice systems, and the communities to which the women will return.

N2  - HIV prevalence is higher in jails than in the community, yet many jails do not conduct HIV testing. Jails in Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the District of Columbia have implemented innovative rapid HIV testing programs. We have summarized the results of these programs, including the numbers of persons tested, rapid and confirmatory HIV test results, and numbers of persons newly diagnosed with HIV. We have described facilitators and challenges of implementation. These programs confirmed that rapid HIV testing in jails was feasible and identified undiagnosed HIV infection. Challenges included limited space to provide confidential rapid HIV testing and rapid turnover of detainees. Implementation required collaboration between local governments, health agencies, and correctional institutions. These programs serve as models for expanding rapid HIV testing in jails.

N2  - Background  The objective of the study was to calculate the prevalence of inmates with intellectual disabilities (ID), and identify historical, medical and criminological characteristics of a certain impact.
Methods  A random sample of 143 inmates from a Norwegian prison cross sectional sample was studied. The Hayes Ability Screening Index (HASI) was validated with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI).
Results  The prevalence of inmates with ID, IQ < 70, was 10.8%. Some essential characteristics of inmates with ID were more frequent medication for mental disorders, a higher number of imprisonments, less drug abuse and less education than the other inmates. The results indicated that the HASI is a valid tool for screening of ID for the Norwegian inmates.
Conclusions  The prevalence of ID in Norwegian inmates is significant, measured by WASI and HASI. Identification, rehabilitation and care, concerning an intellectual handicap, are mostly absent in the Norwegian criminal justice system.

N2  - ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to test whether the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and DSM-5 conduct disorder (CD) subtyping approaches identify adolescents with concurrent psychiatric morbidity and an increased risk to reoffend. A diagnostic interview was used to assess childhood-onset CD (CoCD), adolescent-onset CD (AoCD), and concurrent psychiatric morbidity in 223 detained male adolescents. The callous-unemotional (CU) specifier was established through a self-report questionnaire. Two to four years later, information on official criminal recidivism was collected. The CoCD and AoCD youths were different in concurrent psychiatric morbidity but not in their risk to reoffend. The youths with CD and CU (CD+CU) and the CD-only youths did not differ with regard to concurrent psychiatric morbidity. In addition, the CD+CU youths were at risk to reoffend but merely when compared with their counterparts without CD/CU. Although CD subtyping approaches may identify youths with concurrent psychiatric morbidity, the usefulness to predict recidivism in already delinquent youths is limited.

N2  - Recent guidelines for incarcerated women's programming have called for interventions that address offenders' traumatic experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use in an integrated manner. Seeking Safety (SS) is an empirically supported cognitive behavioral manualized treatment for individuals with PTSD and substance use disorders. This study examined the effectiveness of SS with 59 incarcerated women who completed the intervention and 55 who were waitlisted. Participants in SS demonstrated greater symptom improvement in PTSD and depression as well as improved interpersonal functioning and coping as compared to waitlisted offenders. These findings provide preliminary support for the use of this intervention with incarcerated women.

N2  - Approximately 90 000 inmates are admitted annually to the New York City jail system, many of whom require a high level of medical or mental health services. According to our analysis of deaths in custody from 2001 to 2009, crude death rates have dropped significantly despite the increasing age of the population. Falling HIV-related mortality appears to contribute to this change. Other observations include low rates of suicide across all 9 years and increasing age of the population in recent years.

N2  - The Bournewood case posed a new question of vast numbers of people in hospitals, residential care and other ‘community’ settings: is this person deprived of their liberty? If so, the DoLS or some other formal authority was needed to regulate the situation. Yet this question did not come naturally to the inhabitants of the post-carceral landscape of care, its very meaning imbued with liberation from the legal and institutional structures of the carceral era. Suggestions that people might be ‘deprived of their liberty’ by community care arrangements were outliers, curios for legal enthusiasts (Brearley et al, 1980/2001: 68). For most, this was a ‘hitherto unknown question’ (Allen, 2009: 19), a new game without written rules or clear traditions of practice, to secure or repel the law of institutions in the community through persuasion and other tactics.

N2  - Improving our knowledge of the number of incarcerated youth with disabilities can assist educators, other professionals, and policymakers to develop more effective services for youth. This article reports the findings of a national survey conducted to determine the number of youth identified as having disabilities in the juvenile corrections systems in the United States. The data show that, when compared to the national average, there is an overrepresentation of students identified as having disabilities, especially emotional disturbance, in those systems.

N2  - Background. Chlamydia pneumoniae illness is poorly characterized, particularly as a sole causative pathogen. We investigated a C. pneumoniae outbreak at a federal correctional facility. Methods. We identified inmates with acute respiratory illness (ARI) from 1 November 2009 to 24 February 2010 through clinic self-referral and active case finding. We tested oropharyngeal and/or nasopharyngeal swabs for C. pneumoniae by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and serum samples by microimmunofluorescence. Cases were inmates with ARI and radiologically confirmed pneumonia, positive qPCR, or serological evidence of recent infection. Swabs from 7 acutely ill inmates were tested for 18 respiratory pathogens using qPCR TaqMan Array Cards (TACs). Follow-up swabs from case patients were collected for up to 8 weeks. Results. Among 33 self-referred and 226 randomly selected inmates, 52 (20.1%) met the case definition; pneumonia was confirmed in 4 by radiology only, in 9 by qPCR only, in 17 by serology only, and in 22 by both qPCR and serology. The prison attack rate was 10.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.0%–13.8%). White inmates and residents of housing unit Y were at highest risk. TAC testing detected C. pneumoniae in 4 (57%) inmates; no other causative pathogens were identified. Among 40 inmates followed prospectively, C. pneumoniae was detected for up to 8 weeks. Thirteen (52%) of 25 inmates treated with azithromycin continued to be qPCR positive >2 weeks after treatment. Conclusions. Chlamydia pneumoniae was the causative pathogen of this outbreak. Higher risk among certain groups suggests that social interaction contributed to transmission. Persistence of C. pneumoniae in the oropharynx creates challenges for outbreak control measures.

N2  - The number of older inmates in US correctional facilities is increasing and with it the need for quality palliative health care services. Morbidity and mortality are high in this population. Palliative care in the correctional setting includes most of the challenges faced in the free-living community and several unique barriers to inmate care. Successful models of hospice care in prisons have been established and should be disseminated and evaluated. This article highlights why the changing demographics of prison populations necessitates hospice in this setting and highlights many of the barriers that correctional and consulting physicians face while providing palliative care. Issues specific to palliative care and hospice in prison include palliative care standards, inmate-physician and inmate-family relationships, confidentiality, interdisciplinary care, do-not-resuscitate orders and advance medical directives, medical parole, and the use of inmate volunteers in prison hospice programs. We also include practical recommendations to community-based physicians working with incarcerated or recently released prisoners and describe solutions that can be implemented on an individual and systems basis.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  This study of participants in a US drug treatment court describes the relationship between the imposition of short‐term jail sanctions and substance abuse treatment dropout, and examines offender characteristics moderating or modifying the impact of jail sanctions on treatment dropout.
Methods  Data were derived from administrative information collected by the Dane County Wisconsin Drug Treatment Court from 1996–2004 on all 573 participants achieving a final disposition of treatment completion or failure during those program years. Iterative Cox proportional hazards models of time to treatment failure were created; jail sanctions during drug court participation were framed as time‐dependent covariates. A theoretical framework and specific statistical criteria guided construction of a final parsimonious model of time to treatment drop‐out.
Findings  Treatment failure was associated with unemployment [hazard ratio (HR) in unemployed versus employed = 1.41, P‐value 0.0079], lower educational attainment (HR in high school non‐graduate versus graduate = 1.41, P = 0.02) and application of the first jail sanction (HR 2.71, P < 0.001). The association between treatment failure and a first sanction was considerably stronger for sanctions administered earlier in participation (HR for sanction 1 at <30 days 11.34, P‐value 0.0002).
Conclusions  An initial jail sanction for non‐adherence may be more likely to foster treatment compliance in less refractory individuals (i.e. those not already acclimated or socialized to incarceration or other corrections interventions). More stringent supervisory conditions and individualized services may be required to reintegrate such offenders and promote longer‐term public safety.

N2  - Abstract Background The objective of the study was to estimate the rate of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in male and female offenders newly committed to the Iowa Department of Corrections. We also compared clinical and demographic characteristics of offenders with and without BPD. Methods A random sample of 220 offenders entering Iowa's prison system were evaluated by using a version of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the BPD module of the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders, the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form-36 Health Survey, and the Level of Service Inventory-Revised. Results Borderline personality disorder was present in 65 (29.5%) subjects, although 93.2% had at least one Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV BPD trait. The percentage of women meeting criteria for BPD was more than twice that for men. Subjects with BPD were more likely than those without to be married, employed, and to have a high suicide risk score. Offenders with BPD were more likely than others to report prior mental health treatment, and to have reported high levels of interference from their mental disorder. Offenders with BPD had worse quality of life than offenders without BPD as assessed with the Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 Health Survey, and higher rates of mood, anxiety, psychotic, and eating disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Borderline personality disorder was also associated with higher Level of Service Inventory-Revised total scores, which indicates their having a greater risk for recidivism than nonborderline offenders. These relationships were observed after adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and presence of antisocial personality disorder. Conclusion Borderline personality disorder is relatively common among both male and female offenders in prison, and is associated with substantial psychologic stress and impaired quality of life. Early recognition and treatment of BPD in prisons may be warranted.

N2  - Objectives. We evaluated prevalence and intraprison incidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections among male prison inmates.
Methods. We observed intake prevalence for 4269 sentenced inmates at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institute between 1998 and 2000 and incidence among 446 continuously incarcerated inmates (incarcerated for 12 months or more).
Results. HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus prevalences were 1.8%, 20.2%, and 23.1%, respectively. Infections were significantly associated with injection drug use (odds ratio = 10.1, 7.9, and 32.4). Incidence per 100 person-years was 0 for HIV, 2.7 for HBV, and 0.4 for HCV.
Conclusions. High infection prevalence among inmates represents a significant community health issue. General disease prevention efforts must include prevention within correctional facilities. The high observed intraprison incidence of HBV underscores the need to vaccinate prison populations.

N2  - While the prevalence of mental illness is higher in prisons than in the community, less is known about comparative rates of psychotropic medicine prescribing. This is the first study in a decade to determine the prevalence and patterns of psychotropic medication prescribing in prisons. It is also the first study to comprehensively adjust for age when making comparisons with the general population. Four East of England prisons, housing a total of 2222 men and 341 women were recruited to the study. On census days, clinical records were used to identify and collect data on all prisoners with current, valid prescriptions for hypnotic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, antimanic, antidepressant and/or stimulant medication, as listed in chapters 4.1 to 4.4 of the British National Formulary. Data on 280,168 patients were obtained for comparison purposes from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. After adjusting for age, rates of psychotropic prescribing in prison were 5.5 and 5.9 times higher than in community-based men and women, respectively. We also found marked differences in the individual psychotropic drugs prescribed in prison and community settings. Further work is necessary to determine whether psychotropic prescribing patterns in prison reflect an appropriate balance between managing mental illness, physical health risks and medication misuse.

N2  - Objectives. We tested the hypothesis that higher rates of previous hard drug–related arrests predict lower rates of injection drug use.
Methods. We analyzed drug-related arrest data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program for 93 large US metropolitan statistical areas in 1992 to 2002 to predict previously published annual estimates of the number of injection drug users (IDUs) per 10 000 population.
Results. In linear mixed-effects regression, hard drug–related arrest rates were positively associated (parameter = +1.59; SE = 0.57) with the population rate of IDUs in 1992 and were not associated with change in the IDU rate over time (parameter = −0.15; SE = 0.39).
Conclusions. Deterrence-based approaches to reducing drug use seem not to reduce IDU prevalence. Alternative approaches such as harm reduction, which prevents HIV transmission and increases referrals to treatment, may be a better foundation for policy.

N2  - Smart cities surveil through ubiquitous and intrusive data collection via networked sensors. Smart city efforts are also frequently imagined as primarily top-down and male visions of the future in service of economic benefit. The smart campus presents a new dimension of smart city urbanism as an identified gap in literature. In the following dissertation, I trace sociotechnical imaginaries of a large R1 research university as a smart campus, using an Internet of Things (IoT) pole deployment as a case study. My primary research questions consider the localized co-production and imagining of the smart campus and its implications, explored through four research approaches: (1) interviews with designers, (2) archival review (3) qualitative analysis of visual case study artifacts, and (4) student interviews supported with observational study.Key findings include parallels to existing research on smart city imaginaries based in technosolutionistic, male-dominated, science fiction visions of the future. There is a reproduction of Big Data narratives of efficiency, and top-down implementation of visions extended to the smart campus. I also identify tensions in narratives of purpose, between privacy and surveillance, and digital citizenship dynamics. I employ an intersectional feminist technoscience lens rooted in Science and Technology Studies (STS), as well as notions of data justice and data power, from Critical Data Studies (CDS), and narrative inquiry methods to examine the stabilization and legitimization of these smart campus narratives. I also incorporate analysis of gender, power, and racialized surveillance relevant to carceral imaginaries in the smart campus. With support from narrative inquiry methods, I explore rhetoric underpinning the smart campus imaginary, specifically around promises of democracy, egalitarianism, and technoutopias, tracing influences in national geopolitics, science fiction, and Silicon Valley ideology.This work contributes to existing knowledge on sociotechnical imaginaries of the smart city, documenting a genealogy as it is embedded into the urban space of the smart campus, and presenting an empirically grounded study of smart cities. This work also contributes to understandings of data as power, data assemblages, and data narratives, and to feminist technoscience literature on smart cities and the smart campus in the fields of CDS and STS.

N2  - This thesis examines the relationship between prisons, their aesthetics and those that live around them. It meets a gap in carceral geography research, where there is a need for greater understanding of how prison affects those without a direct connection to the institution (Moran, 2015). The study takes advantage of interdisciplinary emphasis that begins in carceral geography and spans other aspects of human geography, as well as criminology, sociology, planning and politics. To ascertain whether community relationships differ depending on the age, siting and aesthetic of prison, data is gathered using diverse, qualitiative methodologies, from the surrounding communities of two markedly different prisons: Victorian city-centre prison HMP Manchester and industrial-estate based newbuild, HMP Berwyn. The resulting thesis yields rich data on the ways in which local residents engage, and have historically engaged, with prison architecture, eliciting responses around seeing and being seen, historic and contemporary NIMBYism, YIMBYism, and fear.

N2  - At this political moment within the university, mass incarceration and its most recognizable constituents, the prisoner and the prison, are at a predictable tipping point: the violence of inclusion. Neoliberal multiculturalism appears capacious enough to hold select representations of mass incarceration in its pursuit of new markets and deft enough to deploy this difference to whitewash other forms of institutional violence. Building from a long genealogy of scholarship and organizing that maps the coconstitutiveness of the university with our prison-industrial complex, Underground Work makes visible emergent lines and arrangements of power and resistance that inhibit and build abolition.To that end, Work intervenes by problematizing formerly incarcerated subjectivity in the university. Institutional liberal promises cannot be delinked from processes of labor reproduction and racial capitalism. Beyond the neoliberal formation of higher education lies deeper contradictions endemic to enlightenment thought. Work relies on neo-Marxist thought, known as value form theory, to trouble the technologies of possessive individualism and value by suggesting that labor as the value form must be abolished. Work introduces new theory to explain the disciplining features of the carceral state vis-a-vis the political economy and convicted people’s relationship to it. Work claims that we, as convicted people, experience a shadow consciousness. Shadow consciousness exposes how our subjectivities are under threat, especially during moments of crisis and political resistance to state violence. Through an analysis of carcerality, labor and resistance, Work exposes the state sponsored projects intended to discipline our political agency in more detail. Despite the limitations that the framework exposes, we are not without agency. Because of the looming threat of rearrest, shadow consciousness understands the power of clandestine organizing. It is often in the shadows that formerly incarcerated and especially incarcerated people can organize. Though this framing borrows heavily from W. E. B. DuBois’ concept of double consciousness, shadow consciousness involves the purposeful evading of state surveillance as a political project, and this differentiates it from double consciousness.

N2  - Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates obtained from patients who were inmates of the San Francisco County jail system showed an increase in the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from 29%, in 1997, to 74%, in 2002; 91% of the MRSA isolates carried staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type IV. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing demonstrated 2 major clonal groups. One of these clonal groups is genetically indistinguishable from the strain responsible for an outbreak of MRSA in the Los Angeles County jail system in 2002.

N2  - Objectives. We identified factors associated with testing HIV positive in a prison system performing voluntary HIV testing on inmates and estimated the number of undetected HIV cases to evaluate the efficacy of risk-factor–based HIV testing.
Methods. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between HIV serostatus and HIV risk behaviors, mental health, coinfection status, and sociodemographic characteristics for prisoners entering the North Carolina Department of Correction from January 2004 through May 2006. We estimated the number of undetected HIV cases on the basis of age-, gender-, and race-specific HIV prevalences among prisoners and in the state.
Results. Nearly 3.4% (718/21 419) of tested prisoners were HIV positive. The strongest risk factors for infection among men were having sex with men (odds ratio [OR] = 8.0), Black race (OR = 6.2), other non-White race (OR = 7.4), and being aged 35 to 44 years (OR = 4.1). The strongest risk factor among women was Black race (OR = 3.8). Among HIV-positive prisoners, 65% were coinfected with HCV. We estimated that between 24% (223) and 61% (1101) of HIV cases remained undetected.
Conclusions. The associations between HIV serostatus and a variety of factors highlight the potential limitations of risk-factor–based HIV testing in prisons, as do the high number of potential undetected HIV cases.

N2  - Despite increasing numbers of geriatric prisoners, little is known about geriatric disability or health care in prison. Although correctional officers often act as a liaison between prisoners and the healthcare system, the role of officers in recognizing geriatric disability has not been characterized. The goals of this study were to assess officers' assessment of disability in their assigned geriatric prisoners and to contrast their views with reports from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). Questionnaires were given to 71 officers assigned to 618 randomly selected geriatric prisoners in 11 prisons. Information about 41 additional prisoners identified by correctional officers as “high risk” was also analyzed. Prisoner disability and health were determined through correctional officer questionnaires (activity of daily living (ADL) impairment, geriatric syndromes, level of care), chart review (medical diagnoses), and CDCR data (demographics, disability designation). Overall, 211 (34.1%) geriatric prisoners were unknown to their officer. Of the 407 known prisoners, officers reported that 5.0% had ADL impairment and 3.1% were unsafe. Discordance between officer and CDCR reports of disability was common, with officers reporting higher disability rates. The 41 high‐risk prisoners were more likely to have ADL impairment (22.0% vs 5.2%, P<.01) and geriatric syndromes such as falls and incontinence than the random sample. Overall, nearly one‐third of geriatric prisoners were unknown to their assigned officer. Officers identified more disability than the CDCR, and prisoners they identified as high risk had nursing home–level functional impairments. Significant improvement in disability assessment is needed for officers and the CDCR.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Background  Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in primary care settings is used increasingly as a standard method of delivering treatment for heroin users. It has been shown to reduce criminal activity and incarceration over periods of periods of 12 months or less; however, little is known about the effect of this treatment over longer durations.
Aims  To examine the association between treatment status and rates of convictions and cautions (judicial disposals) over a 5‐year period in a cohort of heroin users treated in a general practitioner (GP)‐led MMT service.
Design  Cohort study.
Setting  The primary care clinic for drug dependence, Sheffield, 1999–2005.
Participants  The cohort comprised 108 consecutive patients who were eligible and entered treatment. Ninety were followed‐up for the full 5 years.
Intervention  The intervention consisted of MMT provided by GPs in a primary care clinic setting.
Measurements  Criminal conviction and caution rates and time spent in prison, derived from Police National Computer (PNC) criminal records.
Findings  The overall reduction in the number of convictions and cautions expected for patients entering MMT in similar primary care settings is 10% for each 6 months retained in treatment. Patients in continuous treatment had the greatest reduction in judicial disposal rates, similar to those who were discharged for positive reasons (e.g. drug free). Patients who had more than one treatment episode over the observation period did no better than those who dropped out of treatment.
Conclusions  MMT delivered in a primary care clinic setting is effective in reducing convictions and cautions and incarceration over an extended period. Continuous treatment is associated with the greatest reductions.

N2  - To determine hepatitis C incidence and the demographic and behavioural predictors in seronegative drug injecting prisoners. Prisoners in New South Wales, Australia who: were aged 18 years and over; reported IDU; had been continuously imprisoned; had a documented negative HCV antibody test result in prison in the last 12 months; provided written informed consent. Subjects were interviewed about their demographic characteristics and detailed risk factors for transmission prior to, and since, imprisonment. A blood sample was collected to screen for HCV antibodies by ELISA and RNA by PCR. Of 253 inmates recruited, 120 were continuously imprisoned and included in this analysis. Sixteen acquired HCV infection indicating an incidence of 34.2 per 100 person years (CI: 19.6-55.6). Risk factors for transmission included prior imprisonment, methadone treatment and greater than 10 years of education. Although the frequency of injecting was reduced in prison, 33.6% continued to inject drugs, most commonly methamphetamine, and 90% of these reported sharing injecting equipment. Prison inmates were at high risk of HCV infection, despite some reduction in high-risk behaviours and access to prevention services. To prevent HCV transmission in prisons, better prevention strategies are required.

N2  - The literature on older inmates' health is fragmented and insufficiently developed. In this integrative review, 21 research articles on health and older inmates were identified, critiqued, and synthesized to determine: the minimum age criterion most commonly used; health‐related variables explored; health status; the health impact of incarceration; and aging‐specific policies, programs, and facilities. Age 50 and older was used most often. The top three health variables were psychiatric conditions, physical illnesses, and substance abuse. Self‐reports of health status varied across studies; however, inmates consistently reported health declines since incarceration. Older inmates' health needs appear often to be left unmet. Nursing investigations are needed leading to practice innovations to enhance prisoners' self‐management to reduce disease burden and fiscal and societal costs. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  We examined whether a current major depressive episode (MDE) at baseline predicted crack use and arrests at follow‐up among women enrolled in drug court.
Design  Primary analyses used zero‐inflated Poisson (ZIP) and zero‐inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression analyses to predict both yes/no and number of (i) days of crack use and (ii) arrests at 4‐month follow‐up from current (30‐day) MDE at baseline. Secondary analyses addressed risk conferred by current versus past MDE at baseline.
Setting/Participants  Participants were 261 women in drug court.
Measurements  MDE was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Days using crack and number of arrests were assessed using the Washington University Risk Behavior Assessment for Women.
Findings  Having a current MDE at baseline predicted likelihood of crack use at follow‐up, but not days of crack use among those who used. Current MDE at baseline did not predict presence or number of arrests at the 4‐month follow‐up. Women with current MDE at baseline were more likely to be using crack at follow‐up than were those with recent (31+ days to 12 months) but not current MDE (odds ratio = 5.71); past MDE at baseline did not increase risk of crack use.
Conclusions  Predictors of any versus no crack use or arrests appear to differ from predictors of frequency of these behaviors. Current major depression, but not past major depression, appears to be associated with increased risk of crack use among women attending drug court.

N2  - Continuity of health care among the formerly incarcerated is an emerging public health challenge. We used data from the San Francisco County Jail to determine whether discharge planning improves access to care on release. Inmates who were HIV positive and received discharge planning were 6 times more likely to have a regular source of care in the community compared with inmates with other chronic medical conditions, and they were as likely to have a regular source of care compared with the general San Francisco population.

N2  - An overview of German, Nazi, and Holocaust medicine brings together a group of subjects discussed separately elsewhere. Topics considered include German medicine before and during the Nazi era, such as advanced concepts in epidemiology, preventive medicine, public health policy, screening programs, occupational health laws, compensation for certain medical conditions, and two remarkable guidelines for informed consent for medical procedures; also considered are the Nuremberg Code; American models for early Nazi programs, including compulsory sterilization, abusive medical experiments on prison inmates, and discrimination against black people; two ironies in US and Nazi laws; social Darwinism and racial hygiene; complicity of Nazi physicians, including the acts of sterilization, human experimentation, and genocide; Nazi persecution of Jewish physicians; eponyms of unethical German physicians with particular emphasis on Reiter, Hallervorden, and Pernkopf; eponyms of famous physicians who were Nazi victims, including Pick and van Creveld; and finally, a recommendation for convening an international committee of physicians and ethicists to deal with five issues: (a) to propose alternative names for eponyms of physicians who exhibited complicity during the Nazi era; (b) to honor the eponyms and stories of physicians who were victims of Nazi atrocities and genocide; (c) to apply vigorous pressure to those German and Austrian Institutes that have not yet undertaken investigations to determine if the bodies of Nazi victims remain in their collections; (d) to recommend holding annual commemorations in medical schools and research institutes worldwide to remember and to reflect on the victims of compromised medical practice, particularly, but not exclusively, during the Nazi era because atrocities and acts of genocide have occurred elsewhere; and (e) to examine the influence of any political ideology that compromises the practice of medicine. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

N2  - During what Unsworth (1991) and Castel (1988) called the carceral era, a period dating from the late 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century, the landscape of care became increasingly dominated by institutional confinement. A bifurcated legal framework developed to regulate the institutional confinement of people with mental disabilities, which I call the ‘law of institutions’. One branch of the law of institutions conferred safeguards for individual liberty; the second branch deployed licensing and inspection to regulate the conditions within. I address these frameworks together, referring to them as the ‘law of institutions’, to highlight that they were directed toward governing institutions and their operators as much as acting upon their target populations. These classical carceral-era legal structures have endured for almost 250 years. In England and Wales today, the liberty safeguards branch is performed by the MHA and the MCA DoLS/LPS, and regulatory functions are performed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England, and the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) and Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW). Similar structures exist across most Global North and some Global South countries (Pathare and Sagad, 2013; World Health Organization, 2017).

N2  - Traumatic experiences may dramatically influence later behavior and cognitive processing. This study investigated how trauma shapes the way that we remember personal experiences. Specifically, we investigated overgeneral autobiographical memory, which is the tendency to remember autobiographical events in an overgeneral rather than specific way. We administered the Autobiographical Memory Test (Williams & Broadbent, ) to 86 survivors of political imprisonment 37 years after they had been released from imprisonment. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were not significantly related to overgeneral autobiographical memory. Significant overgeneral autobiographical memory correlates included embitterment, r = −.28, and being released to former East Germany, d = 0.67. Survivors with social support, r = .30 were better able to recall specific memories. Certain trauma characteristics and the way the trauma is processed may thus influence how personal memories are later remembered. This study also furthers the understanding of memory processes in political prisoners, who are not commonly studied in psychological research.

標題：前政治犯中，囚禁對過度概化的自傳式記憶的影響

N2  - Abstract Living donor liver transplantation has evolved to an indispensable surgical strategy to minimize the mortality of adult and pediatric patients awaiting transplantation. The crucial prerequisite to performing this procedure is a minimal risk of donor morbidity and mortality. A 46-year-old woman underwent right hepatectomy for living donor liver transplantation. Two and a half years after liver donation, she presented with upper abdominal pain and fullness. Radiographic evaluation revealed an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia of the right hemithorax. After emergency laparotomy and evaluation of the right hemithorax, a partial jejunal resection was performed due to ischemic findings. The diaphragmatic hernia was repaired. Diaphragmatic hernia is a rarely reported complication of right donor hepatectomy for transplantation and should be considered to be a potential late complication.

N2  - Problem In Malaysia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is highly concentrated among people who inject opioids. For this reason, the country undertook a three-phase roll-out of a methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programme. In Phase 3, described in this paper, MMT was implemented within prisons and retention in care was assessed.
Approach After developing standard operating procedures and agreement between its Prisons Department and Ministry of Health, Malaysia established pilot MMT programmes in two prisons in the states of Kelantan (2008) and Selangor (2009) those with the highest proportions of HIV-infected prisoners. Community-based MMT programmes were also established in Malaysia to integrate treatment activities after prisoners' release.
Local setting Having failed to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, in 2005 Malaysia embarked on a harm reduction strategy.
Relevant changes Standard operating procedures were modified to: (i) escalate the dose of methadone more slowly; (ii) provide ongoing education and training for medical and correctional staff and inmates; (iii) increase the duration of methadone treatment before releasing prisoners; (iv) reinforce linkages with community MMT programmes after prisoners'release; (v) screen for and treat tuberculosis; (vi) escalate the dose of methadone during treatment for HIV infection and tuberculosis; and (vii) optimize the daily oral dose of methadone (>80 mg) before releasing prisoners.
Lessons learnt Prison-based MMT programmes can be effectively implemented but require adequate dosing and measures are needed to improve communication between prison and police authorities, prevent police harassment of MMT clients after their release, and improve systems for tracking release dates.

N2  - BACKGROUND
The challenge posed to prison health systems in the U.S. by an immense incarcerated population is significant. However, the patterns of presentation and associated mortality of cancer among the incarcerated population is unknown.
METHODS
An historical cohort of cancers diagnosed among inmates of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice over the course of 20 years who were followed at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas was identified. There were 1807 inmates who were diagnosed with cancer. Two cohorts were chosen for comparison: a random sample of 179,757 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, and an age‐matched, gender‐matched, race‐matched SEER population comprised of 6124 patients (MSEER). Disease sites and associated mortality of the inmate cancer patients were determined and compared with SEER cohorts.
RESULTS
A marked rise in cancer diagnoses among inmates paralleled the rise in the inmate population. The leading cancers were lung carcinoma, non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and carcinomas of the oral cavity and pharynx. Among women, cervical carcinoma was the most common. Lung carcinoma, NHL, and hepatic carcinoma accounted for more cancer deaths among inmates than in the SEER cohort (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Lung carcinoma, hepatic carcinoma, and NHL were significantly more common in the inmate cohort than in the MSEER cohort (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). The median survival was inferior in the inmate cohort (21 mos) compared with the SEER cohort (55 mos) and the MSEER cohort (54 mos) (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS
Cancers with unique epidemiology and high associated mortality have emerged among the incarcerated. This has significant implications for prison health systems. Cancer 2005. © 2005 American Cancer Society.
The emergence of cancers with unique epidemiology and high associated mortality among the incarcerated population in the U.S. has significant implications for prison healthcare systems.

N2  - Objectives. We determined whether or not juvenile detainees with major mental disorders received treatment, and the variables that predicted who received services.
Methods. Our sample was 1829 randomly selected juvenile detainees taking part in the Northwestern Juvenile Project. To determine need for mental health services, independent interviewers administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and rated functional impairment using the Child Global Assessment Scale. Records on service provision were obtained from the juvenile justice and public health systems.
Results. Among detainees who had major mental disorders and associated functional impairments, 15.4% received treatment in the detention center and 8.1% received treatment in the community by the time of case disposition or 6 months, whichever came first. Significantly more girls than boys were detected and treated. Receiving treatment was predicted by clinical variables (having a major mental disorder or reported treatment history or suicidal behavior) and demographic variables.
Conclusions. The challenge to public health is to provide accessible, innovative, and effective treatments to juvenile detainees, a population that is often beyond the reach of traditional services.

N2  - Shortage of organs for transplantation has led to the renewed interest in donation after circulatory–determination of death (DCDD). We conducted a retrospective analysis (2001–2009) and a subsequent prospective validation (2010) of liver Maastricht‐Category‐3‐DCDD and donation‐after‐brain‐death (DBD) offers to our program. Accepted and declined offers were compared. Accepted DCDD offers were divided into donors who went on to cardiac arrest and those who did not. Donors who arrested were divided into those producing grafts that were transplanted or remained unused. Descriptive comparisons and regression analyses were performed to assess predictor models of donor cardiac arrest and graft utilization. Variables from the multivariate analysis were prospectively validated. Of 1579 DCDD offers, 621 were accepted, and of these, 400 experienced cardiac arrest after withdrawal of support. Of these, 173 livers were transplanted. In the DCDD group, donor age < 40 years, use of inotropes and absence of gag/cough reflexes were predictors of cardiac arrest. Donor age >50 years, BMI >30, warm ischemia time >25 minutes, ITU stay >7 days and ALT ≥ 4× normal rates were risk factors for not using the graft. These variables had excellent sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of cardiac arrest (AUROC = 0.835) and graft use (AUROC = 0.748) in the 2010 prospective validation. These models can feasibly predict cardiac arrest in potential DCDDs and graft usability, helping to avoid unnecessary recoveries and healthcare expenditure.
The authors conduct a retrospective data analysis and prospective validation of predictive models of donor cardiac arrest and potential graft utilization in the setting of donation after circulatory determination of death for liver transplantation.

N2  - Women involved in the criminal justice system, particularly those with a history of drug use, are at elevated risk of HIV infection, yet few HIV prevention interventions have been tailored for delivery to incarcerated women. Drawing on the Relational Model, the Reducing Risky Relationships for HIV (RRR-HIV) intervention was developed and evaluated in a multisite randomized clinical trial. Women with weekly drug use prior to incarceration (n = 444) who were incarcerated within correctional institutions in four states were randomized to (1) the RRR-HIV intervention consisting of an HIV educational video, five group sessions, and one postrelease booster session or (2) a control condition consisting of the HIV educational video. The RRR-HIV intervention combined didactic and interactive content regarding seven "thinking myths" about intimate relationships that may result in decisions to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Data were collected while women were still incarcerated and approximately 90 days following release from prison by trained interviewers. A negative binomial regression (NBR) model of unprotected sexual behaviors at the 90-day follow-up indicated that RRR-HIV participants reported fewer unprotected sexual behaviors than women in the control condition once the analysis was adjusted for study site. Future studies should examine the sustainability of the RRR-HIV intervention's effect on risk reduction. Implementation research is needed to determine whether delivery of this intervention by correctional staff or peers, rather than research staff, yields similar reductions in unprotected sexual behaviors.

N2  - Abstract Suicides in prisons are common. There is a pressing need to understand more about the causes and prevention of prisoner suicides. A particularly informative approach is through studying survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts. However, the extent to which this approach is a good proxy for completed suicide requires verification. In this article we aimed to assess (1) the extent to which male and female prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts in prison are similar to prisoners who die by suicide; (2) the suicidal intent of those making near-lethal suicide attempts; and (3) the applicability of the Suicide Intent Scale in prisons. Survivors of near-lethal suicide attempts and prisoners who died by suicide were compared on sociodemographic and criminological characteristics. The suicidal intent of prisoners engaging in near-lethal self-harm was assessed using Beck's Suicide Intent Scale. There were no significant differences when the sociodemographic and criminological profiles of prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts and those who died by suicide were compared, except that male prisoners who made near-lethal suicide attempts were somewhat younger. Most prisoners carrying out near-lethal acts had high suicidal intent. However, some questions in the Suicide Intent Scale were inappropriate for assessing intent in prisoners. Prisoners who survive near-lethal self-harm would appear to be a valid proxy for those who die by suicide in prison. The Suicide Intent Scale requires some modifications for use in prisons.

N2  - The present study evaluated whether Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptom severity was associated with participation and treatment outcomes comparing a Vipassana meditation course to treatment as usual in an incarcerated sample. This study utilizes secondary data. The original study demonstrated that Vipassana meditation is associated with reductions in substance use. The present study found that PTSD symptom severity did not differ significantly between those who did and did not volunteer to take the course. Participation in the Vipassana course was associated with significantly greater reductions in substance use than treatment as usual, regardless of PTSD symptom severity levels. These results suggest that Vipassana meditation is worthy of further study for those with comorbid PTSD and substance use problems.

N2  - ABSTRACTSystems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) is a manual-based group treatment of persons with borderline personality disorder (BPD). We report results from a study of offenders supervised by the Iowa Department of Corrections. Seventy-seven offenders participated in STEPPS groups. The offenders experienced clinically significant improvement in BPD-related symptoms (d = 1.30), mood, and negative affectivity. Suicidal behaviors and disciplinary infractions were reduced. Baseline severity was inversely associated with improvement. The offenders indicated satisfaction with STEPPS. We conclude that STEPPS can be successfully integrated into the care of offenders with BPD in prison and community corrections settings.

N2  - Background An estimated 162,460 people will die of lung cancer in the United States in 2006, making it the leading cause of cancer deaths. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 20% of all lung cancers and exhibits aggressive behavior with early metastases. Current treatments yield five-year survival rates of 5 to 10%, indicating a need for novel therapeutic approaches. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) represent a new class of anticancer agents. Trichostatin A (TSA), an HDACI, has been shown to inhibit growth in several cancers. We hypothesized that TSA may inhibit proliferation of SCLC cells. Materials and methods Human SCLC DMS53 cells were treated with TSA (0 to 400 nM). Light microscopy was used to assess changes in cell morphology. Western analysis was performed for acetylated histone 4 to confirm HDAC inhibition. The effect of TSA treatment on cellular growth was measured by the MTT assay. Finally, levels of BCL-2, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, p21, and p27 proteins were measured to look for induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Results DMS53 cells treated with TSA underwent dramatic changes in cell appearance. Treated cells assumed round and spindle shapes with distinct cellular borders. Western analysis demonstrated increased levels of acetylated histone 4. TSA treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of growth. Lastly, elevated p21, p27, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase along with decreased BCL-2 protein levels were observed. Conclusions TSA causes morphological differentiation and dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth via cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis. This suggests that TSA and other HDACIs may represent a new potential therapy for patients with SCLC.

N2  - The current study tested hypotheses associated with the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy (Patrick, 2010b; Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009), which describes three distinctive, albeit related, phenotypic domains-boldness, meanness, and disinhibition. We used two samples consisting of 209 female prison inmates and 627 undergraduate students whom had been administered a range of psychopathy and psychopathy-relevant measures. Our results indicated that the triarchic domains explained variance in other psychopathy models to degrees consistent with conceptual expectations. We also examined associations between the triarchic domains and personality traits relevant to psychopathy in the female correctional sample. The results showed that boldness was preferentially associated with narcissism, thrill/adventure seeking, and low behavioral inhibition system functioning; meanness with Machiavellianism, low empathy, and low behavioral inhibition system; and disinhibition with impulsivity and fun seeking.

N2  - Why in this period of so-called liberal democracy are so many wars of genocide committed, yet these wars arenotseen as contradicting democracy? While we often articulate racism as an aberration of democracy or as a result of scapegoating in times of social crisis, Foucault argues that racism is endemic and permanent in the modern state. He contends that the rise of the carceral system entailed a shift from punishment to normalization. This shift was effected through a policing of the body through the technology of the soul. That is, the person who failed to follow the norms of

N2  - Purpose
Unprecedented growth in the US prison population has highlighted the overrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities in prisons. This study examined the hypothesis that veteran status is protective against incarceration for veterans of different racial/ethnic minorities and compared the clinical characteristics of incarcerated veterans by race/ethnicity.
Methods
Using national data from a prisoner re-entry program and data from the 2010 National Survey of Veterans, this study examined the risk of incarceration among veterans who were racial/ethnic minorities and compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to White incarcerated veterans.
Results
Of a sample of 30,834 incarcerated veterans, 52 % were White, 39 % African American, 7 % Hispanic, and 2 % were categorized as “Other.” African American veterans were 5.6 times and Hispanic veterans 4.3 times more likely to be incarcerated than White veterans across age groups. However, the published odds of being incarcerated as an African American in the general population compared to Whites (6.7 times) is higher, suggesting that veteran status may be somewhat protective against incarceration for African Americans, particularly among certain age groups. Among incarcerated veterans, multivariate analyses found that African American veterans were significantly more likely to have a drug/abuse dependency diagnosis and be currently incarcerated for a drug offense than Whites. Hispanic veterans were significantly more likely to be chronically homeless and also more likely to be incarcerated for a drug offense.
Conclusions
Racial/ethnic differences in incarceration persist among veterans, although are slightly attenuated. Efforts to connect incarcerated veterans with mental health services post-release should be supported, especially in connecting veterans to substance abuse treatment.

N2  - Although there is broad consensus that people with serious mental illnesses (SMI) are overrepresented in correctional settings, there is less agreement about the policy trends that may have created this situation. Some researchers and policymakers posit a direct link between deinstitutionalization and increased rates of SMI in jails and prisons, a phenomenon described as
transinstitutionalization.
Others offer evidence that challenges this hypothesis and suggest that it may be a reductionist explanation. This paper reviews claims from both sides of the debate, and concludes that merely increasing access to state psychiatric hospital beds would likely not reduce the number of people with SMI in jails and prisons. A more nuanced approach is recommended for explaining why people with SMI become involved in the criminal justice system and why developing effective strategies to divert them out of jails and prisons and into community-based treatment is needed to improve both their mental health and criminal justice outcomes.

N2  - Background. More than one-third of people in the United States with hepatic C virus (HCV) infection pass through the correctional system annually. Data are lacking on outcomes of treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-RBV) in correctional settings. Methods. During 2002–2006, we analyzed patients in the Connecticut Department of Correction who received PEG-RBV. We assessed the rates of sustained virological response, hospitalization, and use of medications to treat psychiatric disorders and anemia. Results. Of 138 treatment-naive patients referred for treatment, 68 (49%) were approved. Overall, sustained virological response occurred in 47.1% of patients (for HCV genotype 1, 43.1%; for HCV genotypes 2 and 3, 58.8%). Only 9 patients (13%) discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. Multiple regression analysis revealed that not achieving a sustained virological response was correlated with HCV genotype 1 infection plus cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio, 12.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–148) and baseline major depression (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–11.6), but not with HIV infection, a baseline HCV RNA level ⩾400,000 IU/mL, or black race. Compared with baseline, the rate of prescription of a new mood stabilizer (2.2 vs. 0.8 prescriptions per person-year) or an opioid (1.8 vs. 0.5 prescriptions per person-year) was higher during treatment, whereas there was no change in the rate of prescription of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications. Conclusions. These results support the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of PEG-RBV for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in correctional facilities.

N2  - This article addresses a critical inflection point in the history of the long War on Terror: Israel’s 1992 deportation of over four hundred Palestinians to the “no-man’s-land” between Israel and Lebanon, and the camp that the deportees fashioned for the better part of one year to contest the legitimacy of Israeli colonialism and demand their return. The deportation—meant to incapacitate Islamic militant resistance to the US-brokered peace process between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization—paradoxically provided the conditions of possibility for conversation and collaboration among attorneys, doctors, professors, university students, and imams, which had heretofore been highly restricted and regulated by Israel’s carceral practices in the West Bank and Gaza. The deportees—those who in Giorgio Agamben’s estimation had been literally abandoned in a zone of indistinction—engaged in a political practice of “habitational resistance,” refusing their conversion into homines sacri by performing instead a mode of life that rendered multiple lines of transterritorial affiliation, self-assertion, and continuity. The deportees’ published archive—poetry, photobooks, autoethnographies—is understood as a technology of mediation that operates beyond the bounds of the prevailing Islamophobic and orientalist frames while also addressing Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The case of the deportees thus illuminates the articulation of race, religion, and war as it rubs against the linkage between settler colonial dispossession and the Westphalian trinity of nation, state, and territory.

N2  - Objectives. We compared the effects of an enhanced multisession intervention with a single-session intervention on the sexual risk behavior of young men released from prison.
Methods. Young men, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from US prisons in 4 states and systematically assigned to the prerelease single-session intervention or the pre- and postrelease enhanced intervention. Both interventions addressed HIV, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted infections; the enhanced intervention also addressed community reentry needs (e.g., housing, employment). Assessment data were collected before intervention, and 1, 12, and 24 weeks after release.
Results. A total of 522 men were included in intent-to-treat analyses. Follow-up rates ranged from 76% to 87%. Unprotected vaginal or anal sex during the 90 days before incarceration was reported by 86% of men in the enhanced intervention and 89% in the single-session intervention (OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46, 1.32). At 24 weeks, 68% of men assigned to the enhanced intervention reported unprotected vaginal or anal sex compared with 78% of those assigned to the single-session intervention (OR=0.40; 95% CI=0.18, 0.88).
Conclusion. Project START demonstrated the efficacy of a sexual risk–reduction intervention that bridges incarceration and community reentry.

N2  - Communicable diseases are common in people who are incarcerated. We aimed to define the prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis in people who are incarcerated and to identify subgroups with the highest risk of infection. We searched for prevalence studies of chlamydia, gonorrhoea or syphilis in incarcerated populations. Pooled estimates were generated, and meta-regression was conducted. Random effects models yielded pooled prevalence estimates of 5.75% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.01, 6.48) and 12.31% (95% CI 10.61, 14.01) for chlamydia in men and women, 1.4% (95% CI 1.09, 1.70) and 5.73% (4.76, 6.69) for gonorrhoea in men and women, and 2.45% (95% CI 2.08, 2.82) and 6.10% (95% CI 4.75, 7.46) for syphilis in men and women, respectively. Each infection was associated with female gender in meta-regression models. Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis are highly prevalent in these populations. Primary and secondary prevention efforts could improve individual and population health.

N2  - Aim
This study was performed to investigate relations between psychopathology and psychopathy in adolescent female and male detainees.
Method
We examined 91 male and 123 female adolescent detainees (aged 14–19) for psychopathology -using the Youth Self Report, the Overt Aggression Scale-Modified and a Conduct Disorder Self Report Scale- and for psychopathic dimensions using the psychopathy checklist youth version (PCL:YV). Based on a linear regression analysis we compared the specific associations between psychopathology and psychopathy in both male and female delinquent juveniles.
Results
Our results revealed higher scores for externalizing behavior and psychopathic dimensions in delinquent males, and higher internalizing problem scores in delinquent females. Furthermore, we found a positive relationship between suicidal behavior and the psychopathy total score as well as the affective, the lifestyle and the antisocial dimension only in girls. No association was found for suicidal behavior in boys. Regarding anxious-depressive behavior, we found a negative relation to the psychopathy total score and to the affective psychopathy factor for the boys.
Conclusion
Expectedly, the population of incarcerated adolescents exhibited a high prevalence of psychopathology. At the same time our results referred to meaningful gender-related differences with respect to associations with psychopathy. The gender-related differences in psychopathological symptoms could indicate varied subtypes of psychopathy in boys and girls.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  Drug law enforcement remains the dominant response to drug‐related harm. However, the impact of incarceration on deterring drug use remains under‐evaluated. We sought to explore the relationship between incarceration and patterns of drug use among people who inject drugs (IDU).
Design  Using generalized estimating equations (GEE), we examined the prevalence and correlates of injection cessation among participants in the Vancouver Injection Drug User Study followed over 9 years. In subanalyses, we used McNemar's tests and linear growth curve analyses to assess changes in drug use patterns before and after a period of incarceration among participants reporting incarceration and those not incarcerated.
Findings  Among 1603 IDU, 842 (53%) reported injection cessation for at least 6 months at some point during follow‐up. In multivariate GEE analyses, recent incarceration was associated negatively with injection cessation [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37–0.50], whereas the use of methadone was associated positively with cessation (AOR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.22–1.56). In subanalyses assessing longitudinal patterns of drug use among incarcerated individuals and those not incarcerated over the study period, linear growth curve analyses indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in patterns of drug use between the two groups (all P > 0.05).
Conclusions  These observational data suggest that incarceration does not reduce drug use among IDU. Incarceration may inhibit access to mechanisms that promote injection cessation among IDU. In contrast, results indicate that methadone use is associated positively with injection cessation, independent of previous frequency of drug use.

N2  - Our study examines gender differences in traumatic exposure and associated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by a 266 male and female inmates. In our sample, 94.7% of the inmates had experienced at least one traumatic event identified in Trauma History Questionnaire - Modified. Male inmates reported higher rates of witnessing harm to others in childhood (22.4%) and adolescence (43.25) and female inmates, higher rates of interpersonal sexual trauma in childhood (31.2%), adolescence (35.3%), and adulthood (27.7%). Women showed higher rates of PTSD (40.2%) when compared to men (12.5%), as measured by the total PTSD score of the Impact of Event Scale - Revised. The combined trauma types explained 12% and 16% of the total PTSD score in the female and male samples, respectively. In the female model, interpersonal sexual trauma was a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms; whereas in the male model, interpersonal nonsexual trauma was a significant predictor. We discuss these findings as they inform our understanding of gender differences in trauma response and psychiatric morbidity in adulthood.

N2  - Objectives. We tested the efficacy of a combined pharmacologic and behavioral smoking cessation intervention among women in a state prison in the southern United States.
Methods. The study design was a randomized controlled trial with a 6-month waitlist control group. The intervention was a 10-week group intervention combined with nicotine replacement therapy. Two hundred and fifty participants received the intervention, and 289 were in the control group. Assessments occurred at baseline; end of treatment; 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment; and at weekly sessions for participants in the intervention group.
Results. The intervention was efficacious compared with the waitlist control group. Point prevalence quit rates for the intervention group were 18% at end of treatment, 17% at 3-month follow-up, 14% at 6-month follow-up, and 12% at 12-month follow-up, quit rates that are consistent with outcomes from community smoking-cessation interventions.
Conclusions. Female prisoners are interested in smoking cessation interventions and achieved point-prevalence quit rates similar to community samples. Augmenting tobacco control policies in prison with smoking cessation interventions has the potential to address a significant public health need.

N2  - With the number of older adult arrestees and prisoners increasing rapidly, legal professionals increasingly provide front‐line identification and response to age‐related health conditions (including cognitive and physical impairments) that may affect legal outcomes, such as the ability to participate in one's defense or stay safe in jail. The goals of this study were to assess the ability of legal professionals to recognize and respond to age‐related conditions that could affect legal outcomes and to identify recommendations to address important knowledge gaps. This was a mixed quantitative–qualitative study. Legal professionals (N = 72) in the criminal justice system were surveyed to describe their demographic characteristics, expertise, and prior aging‐related training and to inform the qualitative interview guide. Those surveyed included attorneys (district attorneys (25%), public defenders and legal advocates (58%)), judges (6%), and court‐affiliated social workers (11%). In‐depth qualitative interviews were then conducted with a subset of 10 legal professionals who worked with older adults at least weekly. Results from the surveys and interviews revealed knowledge deficits in four important areas: age‐related health, identification of cognitive impairment, assessment of safety risk, and optimization of services upon release from jail. Four recommendations to close these gaps emerged: educate legal professionals about age‐related health, train professionals to identify cognitive and sensory impairment, develop checklists to identify those at risk of poor health or safety, and improve knowledge of and access to transitional services for older adults. These findings suggest that geriatrics knowledge gaps of legal professionals exist that may contribute to adverse medical or legal outcomes for older adults involved in the criminal justice system and that partnerships between healthcare and legal professionals are needed to address these challenges.

N2  - Individual and environmental correlates of nonsuicidal self‐injury (NSSI) and co‐occurring suicide attempts (SA) among incarcerated women (N = 104) were examined. Participants completed measures of putative risk and protective factors, including coping styles, childhood maltreatment, and hopelessness. Results indicated that active coping was uniquely, negatively associated with the presence and frequency of NSSI, whereas avoidant coping and childhood physical/emotional abuse were positively associated with NSSI frequency. Conversely, among women with a history of NSSI, hopelessness was uniquely, positively associated with the presence and frequency of SA. Further, childhood sexual abuse was associated with the presence of SA, while physical/emotional abuse was associated with SA frequency. Hopelessness was more strongly related to SA frequency than NSSI frequency. These findings help disentangle the unique risk and protective factors for NSSI and co‐occurring SA in incarcerated samples.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the long‐term effects of the prisoner of war (POW) experience on U.S. World War II (WWII) veterans.
DESIGN: Exploratory study.
SETTING: Participants were recruited through the Hines Veterans Affairs Hospital; a POW reunion in Orlando, Florida; and the WWII veterans periodical, “The QUAN.”
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty‐seven American military veterans who were former WWII POWs.
MEASURMENTS: Participants completed a mailed survey describing their POW experiences, POW effects on subsequent psychological and physical well‐being, and ways in which these experiences shaped major decisions in their lives.
RESULTS: Participants from the European and Pacific theaters reported that their captivity during WWII affected their long‐term emotional well‐being. Both groups reported high rates of reflection, dreaming, and flashbacks pertaining to their POW experiences, but Pacific theater POWs did so at higher rates in the present than in the past. Large portions of both groups reported greater rumination on POW experiences after retirement. Finally, 16.6% of participants met the requirements of a current, clinical diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) based on the Mississippi PTSD scale, with PTSD rates in Pacific theater POWs (34%) three times those of European theater POWs (12%).
CONCLUSION: Traumatic memories and clinical levels of PTSD persist for WWII POWs as long as 65 years after their captivity. Additionally, rumination about these experiences, including flashbacks and persistent nightmares, may increase after retirement, particularly for those held in the Pacific theater. These findings inform the current therapeutic needs of this elderly population and future generations of POWs from other military conflicts.

N2  - This article offers a critical genealogy of the neoliberal-carceral state by engaging the writing of Black Liberation Army member Assata Shakur. Shakur's work is read as a black feminist theorization of neoliberalism at the very moment of its emergence. By engaging Shakur's discussion of race, gender, time, and the market, the article pursues a connection between chattel slavery and the present that has yet to garner attention among scholars: slavery's haunting possession of neoliberalism. Although slavery's antiblack technologies inhabit and structure the prison, they also live on in the operations of the market. In particular, this article examines the relationship between the carceral, the market, the body, and population to consider how the necropolitics of slavery possess and drive the biopolitics of neoliberalism. The author argues that under neoliberalism, the market not only colludes with the prison, but also mimics it.

N2  - To date, psychological revenge phenomena have not been investigated systematically as factors potentially contributing to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This follow-up study (1995N = 146; 2008N = 93) assessed the predictive power of revenge phenomena for current PTSD symptoms in a sample of former East German political prisoners some four decades after traumatization. As the results of multiple hierarchical regression analyses have revealed, revenge feelings and cognitions significantly contributed to the prediction of both self-reported and clinician-rated PTSD symptoms above and beyond standard predictor variables. In contrast, revenge intentions did not contribute to the prediction of current PTSD. The findings suggest that revenge feelings and cognitions may be a maintaining factor for longtime PTSD. Identification and therapeutic modification of dysfunctional revenge phenomena may therefore enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy for persistent PTSD.

N2  - The use of selective cerebral perfusion with warmer temperatures during circulatory arrest has been increasingly used for arch replacement over concerns regarding the safety of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). However, little data actually exist on outcomes after arch replacement and DHCA. This study examines modern results with DHCA for proximal arch replacement to provide a benchmark for comparison against outcomes with lesser degrees of hypothermia. Between July 2005 and June 2010, 245 proximal arch replacements (“hemiarch”) were performed using deep hypothermia; mean minimum core and nasopharyngeal temperatures were 18.0 ± 2.1°C and 14.1 ± 1.6°C, respectively. Adjunctive cerebral perfusion was used in all cases. Concomitant ascending aortic replacement was performed in 41 per cent, ascending plus aortic valve replacement in 23 per cent, and aortic root replacement in 32 per cent. Mean age was 58 ± 14 years; 36 per cent procedures were urgent/emergent. Mean duration of DHCA was 20.4 ± 6.2 minutes. Thirty-day/in-hospital mortality was 2.9 per cent. Rates of stroke, renal failure, and respiratory failure were 4.1 per cent (0.8% for elective cases), 1.2 per cent, and 0.4 per cent, respectively. Deep hypothermia with adjunctive cerebral perfusion for circulatory arrest during proximal arch replacement affords excellent neurologic as well as nonneurologic outcomes. Centers using lesser degrees of hypothermia for arch surgery, the safety of which remains unproven, should ensure comparable results.

N2  - Existing literature stresses that the far-reaching effects of mass incarceration extend beyond prison walls, profoundly shaping familial experiences. Despite this, families remain consistently overlooked in criminal justice discourse, leading to heightened stress and diminished resilience. This thesis is a program review of a community-based program, referred to here as the Storytelling, Creativity, and Care (SCC) program, to protect the confidentiality of its participants and activities. The SCC program integrates neuroscience and narrative theory to explore how storytelling influences cultural perceptions, shapes lived experiences, and supports psychological and physiological healing. Additionally, this work investigates the socio-political narratives that perpetuate stigma and shame, further entrenching the carceral system’s impact on families. By tailoring interventions to the unique challenges faced by system-impacted families, this review emphasizes the essential role of community-based programs in breaking cycles of recidivism and intergenerational incarceration while amplifying the voices of families to drive healing and social justice.

N2  - More than 6 million men and 1 million women are under US correctional control, be it jail, prison, probation, or parole. On any given day, about 250 000 women and adolescent girls are behind bars, a number well in excess of those documented for all other sovereign nations. Moreover, women and girls represent the fastest-growing segment of the prison and jail populations. Approximately 75% of these women are mothers of minor children (leaving 200 000 children “motherless”) and as many as 10 000 may be pregnant. Primarily designed for male offenders, the US correctional system is struggling to meet the specialized needs of its female inmates. Although incarceration during pregnancy is both stressful and dehumanizing, most studies paradoxically document better outcomes for pregnancies managed behind bars than for women of similar socioeconomic status whose pregnancies are managed in the community. Using the case of Ms A as a springboard for discussion, the issues, benefits, and challenges of caring for an incarcerated pregnant woman are addressed, as is the importance of family planning services to those about to be released.

N2  - Abstract Social stressors are associated with relapse to substance use among people receiving addiction treatment and people with substance use risk behaviors. The relationship between social stressors and drug use/hazardous drinking in former prisoners has not been studied. We interviewed former prisoners at baseline, 1 to 3 weeks post prison release, and follow up, between 2 and 9 months following the baseline interview. Social stressors were characterized by unemployment, homelessness, unstable housing, problems with family, friends, and/or significant others, being single, or major symptoms of depression. Associations between baseline social stressors and follow-up drug use and hazardous drinking were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Problems with family, friends, and/or significant others were associated with reported drug use (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.18–7.67) and hazardous drinking (AOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.05–6.87) post release. Further research may determine whether interventions and policies targeting social stressors can reduce relapse among former inmates.

N2  - OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effectiveness of a participatory approach using an employee design team for a 12-week weight-loss program with an 8-week follow-up.
METHODS:Twenty-four employees with mean [standard error (SE)] for weight 233.24 lb [8.16], body mass index 33.29 kg/cm [0.82], and age 42.7 years [1.5] participated in the study, among whom 75% were men and 25% women.
RESULTS:Significant reductions in weight, body mass index, and waist circumference (among men) were observed before and after intervention (P < 0.05). About 73% and 68% of the variation in weight change (P < 0.01) and waist circumference (P < 0.01), respectively, were explained by Nutrition Knowledge and Exercise Confidence scores after controlling for gender and age.
CONCLUSIONS:A participatory program with employee involvement resulted in positive outcomes. Increasing participantsʼ knowledge and providing skills to manage their weight seem to change their attitudes, resulting in better outcomes.

N2  - Background
The life sentence population is growing older and increasing in number. Despite the potential negative physical and social environment in prisons little is known about the prevalence or aetiology of depression in elderly ‘lifers’.
Aims
To determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of depression in elderly life sentence prisoners.
Method
One hundred and twenty‐one elderly life/indeterminate sentence prisoners from two category B prisons in the United Kingdom were interviewed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and the relationship with prison and non prison specific variables analysed.
Results
Over half of the prisoners scored above the threshold for mild depression. The length of sentence served and other prison related variables were not associated with the depression score. However, the imported chronic physical ill health was strongly related to depression score.
Conclusions
Depression in long term prisoners is common and is related to the burden of imported chronic ill health as opposed to specific effects of imprisonment. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in prisons ranges from 12% to 31%. There are generally accepted - albeit still evolving - guidelines for identification and treatment of hepatitis C in the community. However, there is less agreement among health professionals caring for prisoners about best practices for identification, medical management, and treatment of hepatitis C. inmates often lack health care before incarceration. In prisons, infected persons could be identified and the management of infection initiated; however, the high prevalence of HCV infection among prisoners would impose a disproportionate cost for hepatitis C care on the correctional system. The optimal solution is for prison and public health systems in the United States to jointly provide targeted HCV testing and standard-of-care hepatitis C medical management, treatment, and prevention programs to prison inmate populations. The authors report on a January 2003 meeting of experts in prison health, public health, hepatology, and infectious diseases and explore the clinical care, prevention, and collaboration needed to provide hepatitis C management in prisoners.

N2  - Purpose The
Prevalhep
study seeks to determine the prevalence of factors associated with the hepatitis C (HCV) and B (HBV) virus in Spanish prisoners. Methods This was an observational, cross-sectional study which randomly selected 18 Spanish prisons to participate, with 21 prisoners per centre. Results There were 378 prisoners selected, 370 of whom had serological HCV and 342 had HBV data. The HCV population was predominantly male (91.6%), middle age (66.7% ≤ 40 years of age), of Spanish origin (60.5%), with a history of injection drug use (IDU; 23.2%), in prison <5 years (71.2%) and having entered prison after 2006 (51.9%). The prevalence of HCV was 22.7% (
n
 = 84; 95% CI, 18.3–27.1) and HBV was 2.6% (
n
 = 9; 95% CI, 0.2–4.9%). Of the patients with HCV, 40.5% were co-infected with HIV, 0.3% co-infected with HBV, and 1.5% with triple virus co-infection (HBV + HCV + HIV). The three markers of HB had been measured in 99 inmates: 32.1% had post-vaccination immunity (antiHBS+) and 30.4% contact status with HBV (HBcAb + and/or HBsAg+), while 37.5% were susceptible to HB. Conclusions The prevalence of HBV and HCV has decreased in the Spanish prison population, probably as a result of decrease in IDU transmission, and an increase in immigrant prisoner population that does not have this risk behaviour.

N2  - Abstract The presence of gunshot residues (GSRs) on arrested suspects can help the Court to form an opinion regarding the possibility of utilization of firearms by these suspects. Since the presence of a few particles can in some cases already have a strong indicative value, the GSR experts have to evaluate in their daily work the risk of a potential contamination of these suspects during their arrest. A few studies conducted on police officers and police facilities concluded that the risk of secondary transfer on arrested suspects is quite negligible. However, the case of special force units of the police should be taken into account, since these units can be assumed to be highly contaminated by GSR due to their intensive training. The aim of this study is to evaluate this possibility of particle transfer by performing simulations of arrests by special force police units, according to both low and high contamination scenarios. The results show that secondary transfers of GSR during these simulations are in most cases not negligible, even for the low contamination scenario. This is especially apparent on the vests of the target persons, with an average of 7 GSR particles (2 PbBaSb and 5 TiZn) found on the stubs used on these materials. Of course, the major contamination levels were observed in the case of the high contamination scenario, due to the use of highly contaminated gloves by the police officers during the arrests. Some recommendations are proposed to take into account this risk of contamination and to try to minimize it, or at least to better identify it.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the assessment and treatment outcomes of a prison hepatitis service.
Design and setting: A retrospective, observational cohort study of prison inmates who attended hepatitis clinics from 1996 to 2005 at correctional centres in New South Wales.
Patients: Inmates who attended the clinics, including a nested case–control series of patients who received antiviral treatment and age‐ and sex‐matched patients who did not receive treatment.
Main outcome measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who attended the service; correlates of selection for antiviral treatment; and clinical and virological outcomes of treatment.
Results: Of the 1043 inmates who attended the clinics, 851 were men (82%) and 994 (95%) were referred for HCV infection; the mean age for this group was 33 years (range, 18–74 years). In the case–control series (185 treated and 186 untreated patients), selection for treatment was not biased by culturally and linguistically diverse background, current methadone treatment or psychiatric status. In the treated group, 76 of 138 genotyped patients had a genotype that is predictive of favourable treatment response, and a small minority of those with available liver biopsy results had established cirrhosis (7/119 patients). Of treated patients for whom complete follow‐up data were available, 55% achieved sustained virological response and 100% adhered to therapy. In addition, treatment episodes were not especially complicated.
Conclusion: Although the prison population has high rates of injecting drug use and poor mental health, imprisonment offers an opportunity for assessment and treatment of chronic HCV infection.

N2  - This thesis questions the ability of the present juvenile justice system (JJS) in England and Wales to deliver justice to the individual child offender. It begins with a critique of the early development of the JJS within the historical context of the industrialisation and urbanisation of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It also assesses the present approaches for processing child offenders, and the conflict which persists within the JJS between rehabilitation and punishment. This is followed by an examination of the Scottish JJS in its pre- and postKilbrandon reforms and the present system which continues to evolve whilst remaining focused on the child as an individual in need of help preferably provided outside the formalised courtbased system. The examination of the Irish JJS again explores the divergence in approaches to child offending with the development of a diversionary programmes implemented by the Irish police to direct child offenders away from crime and where possible the formal court system. However, the Irish system also maintains more traditional interventions, including custody, for those who fail to respond. The thesis broadens to assess the extent to which the JJS itself contributes to criminality because of its inherent carceral features which are also present in wider society. It examines the potential negative carceral effects and how they may undermine attempts by child offenders to adopt more positive behaviours. The revolving door of further contact with the JJS is considered and, in some instances, this can continue into adulthood and the adult criminal justice system. The thesis concludes with a proposal for the fundamental reform of the present JJS. It advocates radical approach to child offenders which reflects the insights gained from the examination of the Scottish and Irish JJS, and the field of therapeutic jurisprudence. It proposes the use of behavioural problem solving, rather than punishment, to promote behavioural change in child offenders. It promotes recognition of the child offender as, firstly, a vulnerable child deserving of treatment by a non-criminalised system wherever possible. Such an approach, it is argued, would offer a more sustainable and effective pathway to behavioural change and encourage desistance from offending and though it would benefit primarily the individual child offender, it would also provide benefits to society as a whole.

N2  - BACKGROUND
Older adults comprise an increasing proportion of the prison and homeless populations. While older age is associated with adverse post-release health events and incarceration is a risk factor for homelessness, the health status and homelessness risk of older pre-release prisoners are unknown. Moreover, most post-release services are geared towards veterans; it is unknown whether the needs of non-veterans differ from those of veterans.
OBJECTIVE
To assess health status and risk of homelessness of older pre-release prisoners, and to compare veterans with non-veterans.
DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS
Cross-sectional study of 360 prisoners (≥55 years of age) within 2 years of release from prison using data from the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities.
MAIN MEASURES
Veteran status, health status (based on self-report), and risk of homelessness (homelessness before arrest).
KEY RESULTS
Mean age was 61 years; 93.8% were men and 56.5% were white. Nearly 40% were veterans, of whom 77.2% reported likely VA service eligibility. Veterans were more likely to be white and to have obtained a high school diploma or GED. Overall, 79.1% reported a medical condition and 13.6% reported a serious mental illness. There was little difference in health status between veterans and non-veterans. Although 1 in 12 prisoners reported a risk factor for homelessness, the risk factors did not differ according to veteran status.
CONCLUSIONS
Older pre-release prisoners had a high burden of medical and mental illness and were at risk for post-release homelessness regardless of veteran status. Reentry programs linking pre-release older prisoners to medical and psychiatric services and to homelessness prevention programs are needed for both veterans and non-veterans.

Design, setting and participants: Retrospective cohort study of 85 203 adult offenders who had spent some time in full‐time custody in prisons in New South Wales between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2002.
Main outcome measures: Association between time after release and risk of suicide and overdose death.
Results: Of 844 suicides (795 men, 49 women), 724 (86%) occurred after release. Men had a higher rate of suicide than women both in prison (129 v 56 per 100 000 person‐years) and after release (135 v 82 per 100 000 person‐years). The suicide rate in men in the 2 weeks after release was 3.87 (95% CI, 2.26–6.65) times higher than the rate after 6 months. Male prisoners admitted to the prison psychiatric hospital had a threefold higher risk than non‐admitted men both in prison and after release. No suicides among women were observed in the 2 weeks after release. No increased risk of suicide was observed among Aboriginal Australians in the first 2 weeks after release. Of 1674 deaths due to overdose, 1627 (97%) occurred after release. Drug‐related mortality in men was 9.30 (95% CI, 7.80–11.10) times higher, and in women was 6.42 (95% CI, 3.88–10.62) times higher, in the 2 weeks after release than after 6 months.
Conclusions: Prisoners are at a heightened risk of suicide and overdose death in the immediate post‐release period. After 6 months post‐release, the suicide rate approaches the rate observed in custody.

N2  - Abstract Background Research on hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among non-injecting drug treatment clients in the United States, Europe and Asia indicate substantial differences by place. To date, little or no research on HCV and non-injection drug use (NIDU) has been conducted in Mexico. Methods We examined the prevalence of HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HIV among non-injecting drug users (NIDUs) in community-based drug treatment ( N = 122) and NIDUs in a prison-based drug treatment program ( N = 30), both located in west central Mexico. Results Among the community clients, prevalence was 4.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8–9.2) for HCV, 5.7% for HBV (95% CI: 2.8–11.4), and 1.6% for HIV (95% CI: 0.4–5.8). Among the in-prison clients, prevalence was 40.0% (95% CI: 24.6–57.7) for HCV, 20.0% for HBV (95% CI: 9.5–37.3), and 6.7% for HIV (95% CI: 1.9–21.3). None of the clients were aware of being infected. Conclusion The HCV prevalence found for the NIDU community treatment clients ranks among the lower HCV estimates published for NIDUs in treatment to date. The prevalence found for the in-prison clients ranks among the higher, raising a concern of possible elevated HCV infection among NIDUs in the west central Mexico prison—one compounded by the finding that none of this study's clients knew they were HCV positive.

N2  - Background. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of a person destined to become an organ donor has been associated with overall poor donor quality, especially for the intestinal donor, as splanchnic vasoconstriction that is intended to preserve coronary and cerebral blood flow may result in clinically relevant intestinal ischemia. Outcomes of recipients who receive intestine grafts that have suffered CPR are unknown. We sought to analyze our clinical experience in using intestinal grafts from donors who suffered cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation and to evaluate the outcome of recipients of organs coming from resuscitated donors when compared with recipients of non resuscitated donors.
Methods. We retrospectively analyzed the donor and recipient charts of all of our intestinal transplants with regard to the performance of donor CPR.
Results. Sixty-seven intestinal transplants were performed in 65 patients from November 2003 to December 2007. Twelve donors (18%) were identified as having suffered cardiac arrest and subsequent CPR. Mean duration of CPR was 19.3 +/- 12.7 min. Terminal laboratory profiles of CPR donors and non-CPR donors were similar. Of the 12 resuscitated grafts, two were used for multivisceral, one for a modified multivisceral, seven for liver-intestine, and two for isolated intestinal transplant. There were no significant differences in outcome parameters such as operative time, blood use, ventilation days, length of stay, time to enteral independence, rejection, enteric bacteremia, and survival between the 12 resuscitated grafts and the 55 nonresuscitated grafts.
Conclusion. A donor history of cardiac arrest should not automatically exclude the use of the intestine graft for transplantation.

N2  - To characterize injuries occurring in jails, we analyzed injury report forms from the New York City jail system. We abstracted data from 4695 injury report forms representing 3863 patients. Of the injuries reported, 66% were classified as intentional. The 2 leading causes of injuries were inmate-on-inmate aggression (40%) and slips and falls (27%). Injuries place a considerable burden on jail health care systems, and there is a need for more studies on this problem and development of injury prevention programs.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To describe a proposed national model for controlling the risk presented by offenders convicted of driving while impaired (DWI) and promoting behavioral change to reduce future recidivism.
Setting  Traditional methods of controlling the risk they present to the driving public are not adequate, as indicated by the fact that approximately 1000 people are killed each year‐in alcohol‐related crashes involving drivers convicted of DWI in the previous three years. However, stimulated by the success of special drug courts for substance abusers and new technological methods for monitoring drug and alcohol use, new criminal justice programs for managing impaired driving offenders are emerging.
Intervention  A national model for a comprehensive system applicable to both drug and alcohol impaired drivers is proposed. The program focuses on monitoring offender drinking or the offender driving employing vehicle interlocks with swift, sure but moderate penalties for non‐compliance in which the ultimate sanction is based on offender performance in meeting monitoring requirements.
Findings  Several new court programs, such as the 24/7 Sobriety Project in South Dakota and North Dakota and the Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) Project, which feature alcohol/drug consumption monitoring, have produced evidence that indicates even dependent drinkers can conform to abstinence monitoring requirements and avoid the short‐term jail consequence for failure.
Conclusions  Based on the apparent success of emerging court monitoring systems, it appears that the cost of incarcerating driving‐while‐impaired offenders can be minimized by employing low‐cost community correction programs paid for by the offender.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To track the effect of the French harm reduction programme targeted at intravenous drug users (IDUs) and associated health outcomes.
Material  Since 1996, we have collected monthly sales of sterile syringes and substitution treatments (buprenorphine high dosage and methadone) sold to IDUs in the 23 000 pharmacies in France and collated these figures in a single data base (SIAMOIS). To this data base we have also added the number of syringes distributed through community associations, as well as methadone treatments prescribed in public drug dependence clinics.
Methods  For the period 1996–2003 we analysed syringe sales and prescribed substitution treatments as indicators of access to harm reduction services. We compared variations of these figures over time with trends in health outcome indicators [annual number of fatal overdoses, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence among intravenous drug users], risk behaviour indicators (rate of syringe sharing or rate of syringe re‐use) and legal indicators (heroin and cocaine use‐related arrests).
Findings  The number of sterile syringes sold or distributed to IDUs increased from 1996 to 1999 (+ 21%) and then decreased dramatically from 1999 to 2003 (−40%). In 2003, we estimated that more than 100 000 drug users used substitution treatments. Between 1996 and 2003, a decrease in syringe sharing and syringe re‐use was observed, HIV prevalence among IDUs decreased from 40% to 20% and HCV prevalence remained high (60–70%). From 1996 to 2003, arrests due to heroin use declined (from 17 328 to 4025) and deaths due to overdoses also decreased (from 465 to 89), whereas arrests for cocaine use increased from 1184 to 2511.
Conclusion  Our results indicate that, since 1996 in France, IDUs have had greatly improved access to sterile syringes and substitution treatments. The decrease in syringe sharing and re‐use practices and of HIV prevalence during the same time period indicates that the harm reduction policy implemented in France has had a positive impact. However, because of the persistent sharing and re‐use of syringes and a remaining high HCV prevalence in IDUs, efforts to facilitate access to sterile syringes must continue, and targeting of at‐risk groups must be improved. Behavioural surveys associated with HIV and HCV seroprevalence data are needed to further assess prevention of blood‐borne infections among IDUs in France.

N2  - Summary Previous studies have reported decreasing hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection rates in the general population. However, differential susceptibility in institutionalized populations suggest that HCV infection is even more prevalent in prison populations than previously reported yet, routine screening for HCV infection among prisoners is not generally available. We estimated the HCV prevalence and identified associated exposures at two maximum-security prisons using data obtained from 2788 inmates from the Risk Factors for Spread of Staphylococcus aureus in Prisons Study in New York, which recruited participants from January 2009 and January 2013. HCV prevalence was 10.1% ( n = 295); injection drug use, injection drug use sex partners, and HIV diagnosis exhibited the strongest associations with HCV infection in multivariable models, adjusting for covariates. Taken together, the findings of the present study provide an updated estimate of HCV prevalence and suggest that incarcerated populations represent a declining yet significant portion of the hepatitis epidemic.

N2  - Objective To determine the prevalence and behavioural correlates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among Indonesian prisoners and to examine the impact of voluntary counselling and testing for all incoming prisoners on access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Methods In a non‐anonymous survey in an Indonesian prison for drug‐related offences, all incoming prisoners and symptomatic resident prisoners were counselled and offered testing for HIV, hepatitis B and C. Results Screening was performed in 679 incoming prisoners, of whom 639 (94.1%) agreed to be tested, revealing a seroprevalence of 7.2% (95% CI 5.2-9.2) for HIV, 5.8% (95% CI 3.9-7.6) for HBsAg and 18.6% (95% CI 15.5-21.6) for HCV. Of 57 resident prisoners tested, 29.8% were HIV‐positive. HIV infection was strongly associated with injecting drug use (IDU; P < 0.001), but not with a history of unsafe sex. Screening of incoming prisoners was responsible for diagnosing and treating HIV in 73.0%, respectively, and 68.0% of HIV‐positive individuals. Conclusions HIV and HCV are highly prevalent among incoming Indonesian prisoners and almost entirely explained by IDU. Our study is the first to show that voluntary HIV counselling and testing during the intake process in prison may greatly improve access to ART in a developing country.

N2  - This dissertation examines the use of electronic monitoring (EM) technologies within the U.S. criminal legal system in the context of broader efforts to reform the system. In the wake of mass incarceration, there is widespread and bipartisan consensus that criminal legal reform and change is necessary and urgent. Across the country, strained budgets and greater public knowledge about the social harms of over-incarceration have weakened the assumption that jail and prison are the best tools to deter and prevent crime. EM has been heralded as one possible solution, argued to be both a cheaper and more humane alternative. While previous scholarship has examined the experience of being supervised on EM, scholars have not examined the actors making decisions about how these programs operate and who should be on them. Drawing on interviews with a variety of policy and legal stakeholders, this project explores the penal and policy logics that motivate the use of EM and the knowledge infrastructures that help to create those motivations. I find due to a lack of clear guidance and research about how EM operates in practice, stakeholders attach various meanings and expectations to the technology. By studying EM, I find evidence for a widening bifurcation of policy and penal logics within the criminal legal system that allows for an expansion rather than a shrinking of the carceral state. The intrusion and surveillance of EM is justified for a wide range of legal-involved individuals because of these multiple logics.

N2  - Background. Prisons are recognised internationally as institutions with very high tuberculosis (TB) burdens where transmission is predominantly determined by contact between infectious and susceptible prisoners. A. recent South African court case described the conditions under which prisoners awaiting trial were kept. With the use of these data, a mathematical model was developed to explore the interactions between incarceration conditions and TB control measures.
Methods. Cell dimensions, cell occupancy, lock-up time, TB incidence and treatment delays were derived from court evidence and judicial reports. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between prisoners, we estimated the current TB transmission probability within prison cells, and estimated transmission probabilities of improved levels of case finding in combination with implementation of national and international minimum standards for incarceration.
Results. Levels of overcrowding (230%) in communal cells and Poor TB case finding result in annual TB transmission risks of 90% per annum. Implementing current national or international cell occupancy recommendations would reduce TB transmission probabilities by 30% and 50%, respectively. Improved passive case finding, modest ventilation increase or decreased lock-up time would minimally impact on transmission if introduced individually. However, active case finding together with implementation of minimum national and international standards of incarceration could reduce transmission by 50% and 94%, respectively.
Conclusions. Current conditions of detention for awaiting-trial prisoners are highly conducive for spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Combinations of simple well-established scientific control measures should be implemented urgently.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of release from prison and subsequent re-incarceration on the viral loads of HIV-infected individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Methods: Fifteen re-incarcerated HIV-infected prisoners on HAART were identified from a retrospective cohort of HIV-infected prison inmates released from January 1, 1997, to August 31, 1999. The re-incarcerated prisoners were matched (1:2) to 30 HIV-infected incarcerated prisoners on HAART who remained incarcerated during the re-incarcerated participants' release time period. The outcomes measured were plasma HIV RNA levels, CD4⁺ lymphocyte counts, percentage of re-incarcerated and incarcerated participants with plasma HIV RNA levels &lt400 copies/mL, and the median change in plasma HIV RNA levels of the re-incarcerated and incarcerated participants at the end of the study. Results: At the beginning of the study, 8/15 re-incarcerated participants had plasma HIV RNA levels &lt400 copies/mL, compared with 15/30 incarcerated participants. At the end of the study, only three of those eight re-incarcerated participants had plasma HIV RNA levels &lt400 copies/mL, compared with 14/15 incarcerated participants (p = 0.0086). The median change in plasma HIV RNA levels of the re-incarcerated participants was 1.29$\text{log}_{10}$copies/mL (interquartile range 0.04 to 1.70), compared with -0.03$\text{log}_{10}$copies/mL (interquartile range -0.65 to 0.09) in the incarcerated participants (p = 0.0183). Conclusions: Release from prison was associated with a deleterious effect on virological and immunological outcomes. These data suggest that comprehensive discharge planning efforts are required to make certain that HIV-infected inmates receive access to quality care following incarceration.

N2  - Screening for mental health problems on reception into custody has been criticised. However, there have been few studies on care pathways through custody as a result of screening identification. We aimed to identify what actions were taken as a result of screening positive for suicidal ideation and mental health problems. Case records for 2166 prisoners newly received into five prisons in England and documented contact with health care professionals in the following month were examined by hand over a four-month period. Altogether, 3% of prisoners were screened as having current suicidal ideas, of whom 30% had no contact with mental health services or risk assessment documentation. Another 21% of new receptions received psychotropic medication, for whom over 60% received no primary mental health assessment, and only 36% received psychotropic medication in prison. Care pathways need to be defined, and screening needs to be delivered as originally intended by initial screen for life-threatening matters, followed by a later, comprehensive assessment of health needs.

N2  - Background: Trans people are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates relative to cisgender people and are at increased risk of negative experiences while incarcerated, including poor mental health, violence, sexual abuse, dismissal of self-identity, including poor access to healthcare.Aims: This scoping review sought to identify what is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of correctional staff toward incarcerated trans people within the adult and juvenile justice systems.Method: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the five-stage iterative process developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), utilizing the PRISMA guidelines and checklist for scoping reviews and included an appraisal of included papers. A range of databases and grey literature was included. Literature was assessed against predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with included studies written in English, online full text availability, and reported data relevant to the research question.Results: Seven studies were included with four using qualitative methodologies, one quantitative, and two studies employing a mixed methods approach. These studies provided insights into the systemic lack of knowledge and experience of correctional staff working with trans people, including staff reporting trans issues are not a carceral concern, and carceral settings not offering trans-affirming training to their staff. Within a reform-based approach these findings could be interpreted as passive ignorance and oversights stressing the importance of organizational policies and leadership needing to set standards for promoting the health and wellbeing of incarcerated trans persons.Conclusions: From a transformational lens, findings from this study highlight the urgent need to address the underlying structural, systemic, and organizational factors that impact upon the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors staff have and hold in correctional, and other health and community settings to meaningfully and sustainably improve health, wellbeing, and gender-affirming treatment and care for trans communities, including make possible alternative methods of accountability for those who do harms.

N2  - Juvenile crime affects not only the victims of the crime but also the delinquents’ future. How to prevent adolescent criminal behavior has become an important public policy issue. This study contributes to this interesting issue by examining the relationship between tattooing and adolescents’ criminal behavior. In particular, this study investigates whether or not having a tattoo/tattoos is connected to the incidence of various criminal activities, including: larceny, robbery, fraud, assault, drug use, and homicide. A unique sample of 973 juvenile detainees drawn from the administrative profiles in Taiwan and the coarsened exact matching method were utilized. Results show that compared to their nontattooed counterparts, tattooed juvenile detainees were significantly more likely to commit fraud, assault, drug abuse, and homicide by 3%, 13%, 9%, and 9%, respectively. In contrast, tattooing was not significantly associated with larceny or robbery. From a policy perspective, given the significant link between tattooing and criminal behavior, the presence of a tattoo in adolescents may serve as a valuable indicator regarding adolescents’ high probability of committing crimes.

N2  - Objectives. We estimated the effects of high incarceration rates on rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies.
Methods. We calculated correlations between rates of incarceration in state prisons and county jails and rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies for each of the 100 counties in North Carolina during 1995 to 2002. We also estimated increases in negative health outcomes associated with increases in incarceration rates using negative binomial regression analyses.
Results. Rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies, adjusted for age, race, and poverty distributions by county, consistently increased with increasing incarceration rates. In the most extreme case, teenage pregnancies exhibited an increase of 71.61 per 100000 population (95% confidence interval [CI]=41.88, 101.35) in 1996 after an increase in the prison population rate from 223.31 to 468.58 per 100000 population in 1995.
Conclusions. High rates of incarceration can have the unintended consequence of destabilizing communities and contributing to adverse health outcomes.

N2  - US prison inmates are disproportionately indigent young men of color. These individuals are severely affected by HIV/AIDS, largely owing to the high-risk behavior that they engage in prior to incarceration.
Researchers and practitioners have issued a call for the importance of offering HIV prevention services in prison settings. However, this call has largely been ignored.
In this article, we outline reasons why these recommendations have been largely ignored, discuss innovative HIV prevention programs that are currently being implemented in prison settings, and offer recommendations for securing support for HIV prevention services in correctional settings.

N2  - This dissertation analyzes digital documentaries that utilize second-person address and roleplay to make users feel implicated in contemporary refugee crises, mass incarceration in the U.S., and state and corporate surveillances. Digital documentaries are seemingly more interactive and participatory than linear film and video documentary as they are comprised of a variety of auditory, visual, and written media, utilize networked technologies, and turn the documentary audience into a documentary user. I draw on scholarship from documentary, game, new media, and surveillance studies to analyze how second-person address in digital documentaries is configured through user positioning and direct address within the works themselves, in how organizations and creators frame their productions, and in how users and players respond in reviews, discussion forums, and Let’s Plays. I build on Michael Rothberg’s theorization of the implicated subject to explore how these digital documentaries bring the user into complicated relationality with national and international crises. Visually and experientially implying that users bear responsibility to the subjects and subject matter, these works can, on the one hand, replicate modes of liberal empathy for suffering, distant “others” and, on the other, simulate one’s own surveillant modes of observation or behavior to mirror it back to users and open up one’s offline thoughts and actions as a site of critique.This dissertation charts how second-person address shapes and limits the political potentialities of documentary projects and connects them to a lineage of direct address from educational and propaganda films, museum exhibits, and serious games. By centralizing the user’s individual experience, the interventions that second-person digital documentaries can make into social discourse change from public, institution-based education to more privatized forms of sentimental education geared toward personal edification and self-realization. Unless tied to larger initiatives or movements, I argue that digital documentaries reaffirm a neoliberal politics of individual self-regulation and governance instead of public education or collective, social intervention.Chapter one focuses on 360-degree virtual reality (VR) documentaries that utilize the feeling of presence to position users as if among refugees and as witnesses to refugee experiences in camps outside of Europe and various dwellings in European cities. My analysis of Clouds Over Sidra (Gabo Arora and Chris Milk 2015) and The Displaced (Imraan Ismail and Ben C. Solomon 2015) shows how these VR documentaries utilize observational realism to make believable and immersive their representations of already empathetic refugees. The empathetic refugee is often young, vulnerable, depoliticized and dehistoricized and is a well-known trope in other forms of humanitarian media that continues into VR documentaries. Forced to Flee (Zahra Rasool 2017), I am Rohingya (Zahra Rasool 2017), So Leben Flüchtlinge in Berlin (Berliner Morgenpost 2017), and Limbo: A Virtual Experience of Waiting for Asylum (Shehani Fernando 2017) disrupt easy immersions into realistic-looking VR experiences of stereotyped representations and user identifications and, instead, can reflect back the user’s political inaction and surveillant modes of looking.Chapter two analyzes web- and social media messenger-based documentaries that position users as outsiders to U.S. mass incarceration. Users are noir-style co-investigators into the crime of the prison-industrial complex in Fremont County, Colorado in Prison Valley: The Prison Industry (David Dufresne and Philippe Brault 2009) and co-riders on a bus transporting prison inmates’ loved ones for visitations to correctional facilities in Upstate New York in A Temporary Contact (Nirit Peled and Sara Kolster 2017). Both projects construct an experience of carceral constraint for users to reinscribe seeming “outside” places, people, and experiences as within the continuation of the racialized and classed politics of state control through mass incarceration. These projects utilize interfaces that create a tension between replicating an exploitative hierarchy between non-incarcerated users and those subject to mass incarceration while also deimmersing users in these experiences to mirror back the user’s supposed distance from this mode of state regulation. Chapter three investigates a type of digital game I term dataveillance simulation games, which position users as surveillance agents in ambiguously dystopian nation-states and force users to use their own critical thinking and judgment to construct the criminality of state-sanctioned surveillance targets. Project Perfect Citizen (Bad Cop Studios 2016), Orwell: Keeping an Eye on You (Osmotic Studios 2016), and Papers, Please (Lucas Pope 2013) all create a dual empathy: players empathize with bureaucratic surveillance agents while empathizing with surveillance targets whose emails, text messages, documents, and social media profiles reveal them to be “normal” people. I argue that while these games show criminality to be a construct, they also utilize a racialized fear of the loss of one’s individual privacy to make players feel like they too could be surveillance targets. Chapter four examines personalized digital documentaries that turn users and their data into the subject matter. Do Not Track (Brett Gaylor 2015), A Week with Wanda (Joe Derry Hall 2019), Stealing Ur Feelings (Noah Levenson 2019), Alfred Premium (Joël Ronez, Pierre Corbinais, and Émilie F. Grenier 2019), How They Watch You (Nick Briz 2021), and Fairly Intelligent™ (A.M. Darke 2021) track, monitor, and confront users with their own online behavior to reflect back a corporate surveillance that collects, analyzes, and exploits user data for profit. These digital documentaries utilize emotional fear- and humor-based appeals to persuade users that these technologies are controlling them, shaping their desires and needs, and dehumanizing them through algorithmic surveillance.

N2  - Endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) is an ER luminal protein that has a role in protein unfolding and secretion, but its role in cancer is unclear. Recently, we reported that overexpression of ERp29 significantly inhibited cell proliferation and prevented tumorigenesis in highly proliferative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Here, we show that ERp29-induced cancer cell growth arrest is modulated by the interplay between the concomitant phosphorylation of p38 and upregulation of the inhibitor of the interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, p58IPK. In this cell model, ERp29 overexpression significantly downregulates modulators of cell proliferation, namely urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, β1-integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor. Furthermore, ERp29 significantly (P<0.001) increases phosphorylation of p38 (p-p38) and reduces matrix metalloproteinase-9 secretion. The role of ERp29 in upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p15 and p21) and in downregulating cyclin D2 is demonstrated in slowly proliferating ERp29-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the opposite response was observed in ERp29-knockdown MCF-7 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of p-p38 downregulates p15 and p21 and inhibits eIF2α phosphorylation, indicating a role for p-p38 in this process. Furthermore, p58IPK expression was increased in ERp29-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells and highly decreased in ERp29-knockdown MCF-7 cells. This upregulation of p58IPK by ERp29 suppresses the activation of p-p38/p-PERK/p-eIF2α by repressing eIF2α phosphorylation. In fact, reduction of p58IPK expression by RNA interference stimulated eIF2α phosphorylation. The repression of eIF2α phosphorylation by p58IPK prevents ERp29-transfected cells from undergoing ER-dependent apoptosis driven by the activation of ATF4/CHOP/caspase-3. Hence, the interplay between p38 phosphorylation and p58IPK upregulation has key roles in modulating ERp29-induced cell-growth arrest and survival.

N2  - An intra-aortic balloon pump and a temporary tunnelled dual chamber pacemaker were placed, which permitted potent vasodilator therapy (intravenous glyceryl trinitrate and verapamil, with nifedipine via a nasogastric tube) to be established without the need for prolonged use of inotropes. In a recent study of 1429 patients with vasospastic angina, 35 (2·4%) had an out-of-hospital arrest and were younger (mean age 58 years) and more likely to have spasm of the left anterior descending coronary artery than were patients who had not had cardiac arrest.4 Since predicting which patients will have recurrent events is difficult, one suggestion is that all patients with vasospastic angina and a history of life-threatening arrhythmia could benefit from an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator alongside calcium channel blockers.2 In the absence of ventricular arrhythmias in our patient, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was not felt to be beneficial.

N2  - Purpose: To describe sexual health risks in an understudied group, youth in detention, and compare these to sexual health risks among non-detained youth. In addition, variables predicting adverse sexual health outcomes are sought and compared. Methods: In 2009, a self-administered questionnaire on sexuality was conducted amongst youth in Sweden. In 2010, the same Internet-based questionnaire was applied in a study at Swedish detention centres. In this article, sexually active youth aged 15-20 years in the two groups are compared and bivariate logistic regression analyses are conducted in order to find predictors of adverse sexual health outcomes, among detainees and non-detainees respectively. Results: Major differences between the detained and the non-detained concerning a majority of risk-taking variables exist. Conclusions: Although detained youth display several risky sexual behaviors, no specific risk factors are found in a logistic regression analysis. However, this is a vulnerable group. The mere fact that an adolescent is placed at a detention centre should be an imperative for professionals to address the subject of sexual health and safer sex. Furthermore, the results will be used in a forthcoming sex education curriculum tailored especially at detained youth. This is one, but by far not the only way to minimize the health inequalities that are presented in this study.

N2  - This is a study of how prisons became a common sense solution to economic and social decline in northern New York in the 1980s, about how prisons became synonymous with development in rural counties in the long wake of New York City’s fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s. The United States imprisons more people per capita than any other nation-state on earth. The number of U.S. prisoners has increased nearly six fold since 1970 and there are now over 2.25 million people incarcerated across the country. Accompanying and encouraging this rise in the prison population was an expansion of the prisons themselves, with many states building new correctional facilities in depressed rural areas or deindustrializing small towns. New York State, emerging from the economic crisis of the mid-70s and shifting its development priorities from urban renewal to carceral expansion, presided over a vast prison infrastructure build-up in rural areas and deindustrializing small towns from the 1980s to 2000. The increase in the prison population over the past 40 years involved a concomitant broadening and deepening of prison capacity: one of the most expansive and expensive infrastructural projects in the history of a state that has led the country in massive public works. Thirty-eight new prisons were built in New York in the period between 1983 and 2000, despite the electorate’s rejection, in a referendum in 1981, of a bond issue meant to fund new prison construction. To bypass the voters of the state, in order to continue to expand carceral infrastructure, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and the New York State Legislature funded new prison construction in the 80s and 90s through the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), a public corporation created by Nelson Rockefeller in 1968 to build low income urban housing. The story of how New York expanded the state prison system is then also the story of how financial technologies and governmental and quasi-governmental (or shadow-governmental) institutions transformed and were transformed by the economic and social crises of the 60s, 70s and 80s.

N2  - Few social dynamics have altered the landscape of communities in the United States as profoundly as the buildup of a Prison Nation and the expansion of the carceral state. In this chapter, we will use the terms "carceral expansion," "carceral state," and "buildup of a Prison Nation" interchangeably. As the discussion will show, these concepts refer to the ways that ideology, economic policy, and legal/legislative initiatives have supported the growth of legal apparatuses associated with punishment. We have witnessed dramatic shifts in how this country understands, uses, responds to, and, in some sense, creates "crime" in contemporary society, from massive financial investments in law enforcement and surveillance technology; the amplification of deep ideological commitments to retributive justice; aggressive punishment regimes (including preemptive arrests); the swell in the number of the facilities that imprison over 7 million people (for longer periods of time, in harsher conditions) to the co-optation of major reform efforts, these shifts are comprehensive and well-documented. The impact of this shift affects the communities that have been the focus of social work attention for decades; those that have been the most disadvantaged by historical patterns of discrimination and social policies of exclusion.

N2  - Objective: To compare offenders with high versus low perceptions of risk for being stopped by police for drinking and driving using measures of beliefs, behaviors, social context of drinking, and perceived influence from a significant other in their social network.
Method: Telephone interviews were conducted with 161 individuals who received a first-time driving under the influence (DUI) citation in Maryland. They were divided into 2 groups: those who felt that it was almost certain or very likely that they would be stopped by the police if they drove after having too much to drink (n = 56) and those who felt that it was only somewhat likely or unlikely (n = 105).
Results: The 2 groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, employment, or marital status. Offenders with a low perceived risk of being stopped were less likely to believe that they would be convicted if they were stopped and arrested. They were more likely to report having an encounter with an aggressive driver, running through a stop sign or traffic light, drinking in a context of social facilitation, knowing someone in their social network who had received a DUI citation, and having a member of their social network suggest that they had had too much to drink and could not drive safely.
Conclusions: The social context of drinking and the relationship they have to their social network have important implications for influencing first DUI offenders and preventing them from recidivating.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To describe the profile of imprisoned opioid‐dependent patients, prescriptions of maintenance therapy at imprisonment and 3‐year outcome in terms of re‐incarceration and mortality.
Design  Prospective, observational study (France, 2003–06).
Setting  Health units of 47 remand prisons.
Participants  A total of 507 opioid‐dependent patients included within the first week of imprisonment between June 2003 and September 2004, inclusive.
Measurements  Physicians collected socio‐demographic data, penal history, history of addiction, maintenance therapy and psychoactive agent use, general health status and comorbidities. Prescriptions at imprisonment were recorded by the prison pharmacist. Re‐incarceration data were retrieved from the National Register of Inmates, survival data and causes of death from the National Registers of vital status and death causes.
Findings  Prison maintenance therapy was delivered at imprisonment to 394/507 (77.7%) patients. These patients had poorer health status, heavier opioid use and prison history and were less socially integrated than the remaining 113 patients. Over 3 years, 238/478 patients were re‐incarcerated [51.3 re‐incarcerations per 100 patient‐years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 46.4–56.2]. Factors associated independently with re‐incarceration were prior imprisonment and benzodiazepine use. After adjustment for confounders, maintenance therapy was not associated with a reduced rate of re‐incarceration (adjusted relative risk 1.28, 95% CI 0.89–1.85). The all‐cause mortality rate was eight per 1000 patient‐years (n = 10, 95% CI 4–13).
Conclusions  Prescription of maintenance therapy has increased sharply in French prisons since its introduction in the mid‐1990s. However, the risk of re‐imprisonment or death remains high among opioid‐dependent prisoners. Substantial efforts are needed to implement more effective preventive policies.

N2  - Objective Delayed preconditioning genetically reprograms the response to ischemic injury. Subclinical bacterial lipopolysaccharide acts through preconditioning, powerfully protecting against experimental stroke. We investigated the potential for lipopolysaccharide to protect against brain injury related to cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods Neonatal piglets were blindly and randomly preconditioned with lipopolysaccharide (n = 6) or saline (n = 6). Three days later, they experienced 2 hours of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest before being weaned and supported anesthetized for 20 hours in an intensive care setting. Controls included cardiopulmonary bypass without deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (n = 3) and no cardiopulmonary bypass (n = 3). Brain injury was quantified by light and fluorescent microscopy (Fluoro-Jade; Histo-Chem, Inc, Jefferson, Ark). Results All animals were clinically indistinguishable before surgery. Perioperative and postoperative parameters between experimental groups were similar. No control animal scored falsely positive. Histologic scores were 0.33 ± 0.21, 0.66 ± 0.42, and 0.5 ± 0.24 in the cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus, respectively, in the lipopolysaccharide-treated animals but significantly worse in all saline control animals (1.33 ± 0.21, P < .01; 1.66 ± 0.33, P = .09; and 6.0 ± 1.5, P < .01). One lipopolysaccharide-treated brain was histologically indistinguishable from controls. Conclusion This is the first evidence that lipopolysaccharide can precondition against cardiopulmonary bypass–related injury. Because lipopolysaccharide preconditioning is a systemic phenomenon offering proven protection against myocardial, hepatic, and pulmonary injury, this technique offers enormous potential for protecting against systemic neonatal injury related to cardiopulmonary bypass.

N2  - This essay reflects on the prison stories of three women migrant workers in Hong Kong. All three women initially entered Hong Kong as domestic workers, then overstayed their visas and worked illegally before surrendering to immigration and serving prison time. Their stories of life inside and outside of prison raise many questions, especially about the forms of power and control they encountered. Drawing from what Deleuze, building on Foucault, has provocatively characterized as “societies of discipline” and “societies of control” (1992), I show how both sorts of discipline and control (and punitive sovereign ones) coexist in migrant’s lives. Prison, as Foucault described, is characterized by carceral forms of discipline aimed at reforming individuals. Women’s experiences of prison, I argue, are colored by its conventional disciplinary form and function, including expectations of post-incarceration societal reincorporation. Life outside of prison, by contrast, is characterized by more fluid and diffuse assemblages, information technologies, and networks of control. The lives of overstayers before prison, can offer them freedom and temporary escape from networks of control, but also produce anxiety, fear, and exclusion. These women’s experiences thus point to limitations and provocative aspects of Foucault and Deleuze’s models, and to ways in which migratory lives are shaped and characterized by multiple types of control and discipline.

N2  - The Depression Hopelessness Suicide Screening Form (DHS) includes 12 'critical items', which have not been validated for the prospective prediction of self-harm. We conducted a retrospective cohort study (N = 4196) to validate the ability of the DHS critical items to prospectively predict inmates with at least one incident of self-harm during the first six months of imprisonment. While the critical items were highly sensitive (89.5%) at predicting incidents of self-harm, 51.3% of the inmates endorsed at least one item. Five items reflecting more recent and specific risk factors reduced the referral rate to 17.7%, while maintaining high sensitivity (84.2%). While the DHS has high sensitivity to predict inmates at risk of self-harm, treating all items as equally critical results in excessive numbers of false positives that likely exceed the capacity of prison resources for professional assessment and intervention. Referral rules based on recency and specificity of risk factors are proposed.

N2  - It has long been assumed that risk taking is closely associated with criminal behavior. One reason for placing criminals behind bars—aside from punishment and protecting the public—is to prevent them from engaging in further risky criminal activities. Limited attention has been paid to whether being inside or outside prison affects offenders’ risk‐taking behaviors and attitudes. We compared risk‐taking behaviors and attitudes in five risk domains (ethical, financial, health/safety, recreational, social) among 75 incarcerated offenders (i.e., offenders who are currently in prison) and 45 ex‐offenders (i.e., offenders who have just been released from prison). Ex‐offenders reported higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior, driven largely by a willingness to take more risks in the recreational and ethical domains. Benefits attributed to risk taking as well as risk perception did not differ between incarcerated and ex‐offenders, indicating that the opportunity to take risks might underlie behavioral risk intentions. Our results also indicate that risk‐taking activities are better predicted by the expected benefits rather than by risk perception, aside from the health/safety domain. These results highlight the importance of studying the person and the environment and examining risk taking in a number of content domains.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to assess appropriateness of medication prescribing for older Texas prisoners.
Methods. In this 12-month cross-sectional study of 13 117 prisoners (aged ≥ 55 years), we assessed medication use with Zhan criteria and compared our results to prior studies of community prescribing. We assessed use of indicated medications with 6 Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders indicators.
Results. Inappropriate medications were prescribed to a third of older prisoners; half of inappropriate use was attributable to over-the-counter antihistamines. When these antihistamines were excluded, inappropriate use dropped to 14% (≥ 55 years) and 17% (≥ 65 years), equivalent to rates in a Department of Veterans Affairs study (17%) and lower than rates in a health maintenance organization study (26%). Median rate of indicated medication use for the 6 indicators was 80% (range = 12%–95%); gastrointestinal prophylaxis for patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories at high risk for gastrointestinal bleed constituted the lowest rate.
Conclusions. Medication prescribing for older prisoners in Texas was similar to that for older community adults. However, overuse of antihistamines and underuse of gastrointestinal prophylaxis suggests a need for education of prison health care providers in appropriate prescribing practices for older adults.

N2  - Objective:
A growing body of research consistently shows that detained minors bear substantial mental health needs. However, the relation between mental disorder and criminal recidivism has largely remained unexplored. Our study examines whether psychiatric disorders increase the likelihood of recidivism after controlling for time at risk, criminal history, and the presence of other disorders.
Method:
Participants (n = 232) were detained male adolescents from all 3 youth detention centres in Flanders, Belgium, who were interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV. Two to 4 years later, information on serious recidivism was retrieved from the official judicial registration system. Serious recidivism was defined as having at least one arrest charge for violent, severe property crime, or substance-related offences.
Results:
Serious recidivism was high, with 81% (n = 191) of the participants being rearrested. Psychiatric disorders predicted neither serious recidivism in general nor violent and severe property recidivism. However, other drug use disorder (OR 2.41; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.75) and general comorbidity (OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.40 to 4.99) were significantly predictive of substance-related recidivism.
Conclusion:
Common psychiatric disorders in detained male adolescents do not significantly increase the likelihood of subsequent arrests, with the exception that substance use disorders appear to increase the risk of later substance-related recidivism. Effective treatment of these disorders may prevent detained juveniles to experience the detrimental outcomes associated with substance-related crimes as adults (for example, mental illness).

N2  - Objectives
Chinese correctional officers (COs) consist of frontline COs in direct contact with the prisoners and non-frontline COs (including administrative staff and professionals). Male COs compose the majority of Chinese COs, especially for frontline COs. Although they are quite susceptible to depressive symptoms due to highly risky and stressful working environment, few studies focus on this issue. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and to explore its associated factors among Chinese male frontline and non-frontline COs.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was performed during the period of March/April 2011. The study population comprised of 1,900 male COs in four male prisons in a province of northeast China. A questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, demographic factors, work conditions, effort–reward imbalance questionnaire was distributed to these COs. A total of 1,494 effective respondents became our subjects (981 frontline COs and 513 non-frontline COs). Frontline and non-frontline COs were analyzed separately.
Results
Approximately 61.4 % of Chinese male COs had depressive symptoms (63.5 % in frontline COs and 57.3 % in non-frontline COs). Multivariate logistic analyses showed that effort–reward ratio, overcommitment, chronic disease, and threat perception were associated with depressive symptoms in frontline and non-frontline COs, whereas weekly work time had an effect only in frontline COs.
Conclusions
Chinese male COs, especially frontline COs, might have high-level prevalence of depressive symptoms. Moreover, this study had identified important risk factors that might be important in planning strategies for prevention and intervention of depressive symptoms for Chinese male COs.

N2  - Abstract Objective The objective of the study was to identify sex-specific psychopathologic predictors of criminal recidivism among a representative sample of incarcerated youths. Method In this prospective longitudinal study, the Mini-International Psychiatric Interview for children and adolescents was used to assess psychopathology in juveniles entering an Austrian pretrial detention facility between March 2003 and January 2005. From the beginning of the study until January 2006, data on criminal history were obtained from the Integrierte Vollzugsverwaltung , a database containing criminal information of every individual incarcerated in Austria. Of the 370 eligible participants, the final study sample comprised 328 juveniles (56 girls and 272 boys, age range = 14-21 years, mean = 16.7). Results Reincarceration rates within the specified follow-up period were 52.6% for the boys and 37.5% for the girls. Using Cox forward stepwise regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses, age at first incarceration ( B = −.296, Wald statistic = 17.11, P < .001) and oppositional defiant disorder ( B = .751, Wald statistic = 19.25, P < .001) were identified as significant predictors for reoffending in boys. In girls, generalized anxiety disorder ( B = 1.97, Wald statistic = 13.71, P < .001) was found to be a predictor for reoffending, whereas dysthymia ( B = −1.44, Wald statistic = 4.02, P = .045) was found to serve as protective factor. Conclusion Our study confirms high rates of reoffending after release from correctional facilities in both sexes. It further defines sex-specific psychopathologic risk factors for relapse in incarcerated juveniles. According to our results, in boys, oppositional defiant disorder and early age at first incarceration are predictive of reincarceration. In girls, anxiety disorder was found to be a risk factor for future offending, whereas dysthymia was found to have a protective influence. Consequently, rehabilitation programs should be sex specific.

N2  - How do Caribbean islands figure in the Anthropocene, the so-called "Age of the Human," when anthropogenic climate change threatens the Earth system? The attempt to situate this work at the intersection of multiple disciplinary fields reveals Sheller's ambition to challenge received ideas about mobility and migration, humanitarian aid, economic development, and climate change. By way of a mobility justice framework, Sheller reinvigorates Michel Foucault's theory of the "carceral archipelago" with attention to the organization of systems (technologies, goods, capital) and discourses of power that both facilitate and prevent the movement of people.3 Such unequal access to and control of circuits of political and economic exchange, coupled with the slow violence of extraction and degradation, have created the conditions for what Sheller calls "the coloniality of climate," which, she explains, "is the result both of coloniality in the past and of neocolonial restructuring today" (10). In two case studies, examining a water filtration system furnished by a foreign charity and a solar-powered, public water kiosk provided by a nongovernmental organization (NGO), Sheller demonstrates how the right to clean water "produces new social conflicts over infrastructure" (49).

N2  - Abstract Objective To increase understanding of how the prison environment influences the mental health of prisoners and prison staff. Design Qualitative study with focus groups. Setting A local prison in southern England. Participants Prisoners and prison staff. Results Prisoners reported that long periods of isolation with little mental stimulus contributed to poor mental health and led to intense feelings of anger, frustration, and anxiety. Prisoners said they misused drugs to relieve the long hours of tedium. Most focus groups identified negative relationships between staff and prisoners as an important issue affecting stress levels of staff and prisoners. Staff groups described a “circle of stress,” whereby the prison culture, organisation, and staff shortages caused high staff stress levels, resulting in staff sickness, which in turn caused greater stress for remaining staff. Staff shortages also affected prisoners, who would be locked up for longer periods of time, the ensuing frustration would then be released on staff, aggravating the situation still further. Insufficient staff also affected control and monitoring of bullying and reduced the amount of time in which prisoners were able to maintain contact with their families. Conclusions Greater consideration should be given to understanding the wider environmental and organisational factors that contribute to poor mental health in prisons. This information can be used to inform prison policy makers and managers, and the primary care trusts who are beginning to work in partnership with prisons to improve the mental health of prisoners.

N2  - The point-of-reception into prison is a critical juncture as it provides early opportunities to identify mental illness and initiate treatment. Although large numbers of mentally ill prisoners are received into prison each day, research investigating mental health screening outcomes at the point-of-reception is limited. This study aimed to address this gap by examining reception screening outcomes for all prisoners received into an Australian prison during 2009 (n = 4229). Overall, 19% of all prisoners were mentally ill, and another 20% had a history of psychiatric illness that required ongoing care. Mentally ill prisoners had a higher risk of suicide or self-harm and required more observation than other prisoners. At reception, no mentally ill prisoners were transferred to the state's forensic hospital and few were transferred to the prison's mental health unit, or provided support service referrals. These findings highlight that outcomes made at the point-of-reception are heavily influenced by the availability of prison mental health resources.

N2  - This study evaluated effectiveness of group therapy for incarcerated women with histories of childhood sexual and/or physical abuse. The intervention was based on a two‐stage model of trauma treatment and included Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills and writing assignments. We randomly assigned 24 participants to group treatment (13 completed) and 25 to a no‐contact comparison condition (18 completed). We evaluated treatment effects, using the Beck Depression Inventory, Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, and Trauma Symptom Inventory. The data demonstrate significant reductions in PTSD, mood, and interpersonal symptoms in the treatment group.

N2  - As most universities move to blended or entirely online digital delivery models, large cohorts of students are excluded from participation. For those universities that espouse the idea that education is democratic, this proves to be problematic. The digital delivery of education, while enabling participation from certain groups such as regional learners or stay-at-home carers, excludes those without ready access to technology or connectivity. Prominent among the latter group are prisoners who in most correctional jurisdictions do not have access to modern technologies or to the internet. This chapter will examine how one university, the University of Southern Queensland, responded to the challenge of delivering digital higher education to prisoners. The journey has been a tortuous one that began with a few idealistic academics acting as champions some three decades ago and became a university-wide project pushing the boundaries of what was technically possible and culturally palatable. The university is now the largest supplier of higher education into prisons in Australia and one of the largest in the world. This chapter will argue that this was enabled by a shift in culture in both the university and in the correctional jurisdictions in which it operates. The university has challenged the largely unspoken but widely held notion that prisoners have limited intellects and are only capable of completing low-level qualifications. The incarcerated learners engaged with the university boast both higher retention rates and better results than their non-incarcerated counterparts.

N2  - Abstract The deprivation of liberty in police custody can be associated with violent situations and traumatic injuries. The rare available data did not mention whether alleged assaults occurred at the time of the arrest or during custody. Our objectives were to describe the frequency of recent traumatic injuries observed in detainees at the time of medical examination and to record detainees’ self-reports of received physical violence, either before being arrested, at the time of the arrest, or during custody. In 2694 consecutive detainees examined in a suburban area near Paris, we compared persons’ characteristics in four groups, according to the existence of alleged assaults or the presence of recent traumatic injuries, or both. Detainees reported to be victims of physical assaults in 25% of cases (686 of 2694): 374 assaults of 686 (55%) occurred at the time of arrest and 87 of 686 (13%) during custody. The opinion of assaulted detainees on custody was worse than non-assaulted detainees. Detainees alleging assaults by the police, whatever the time of the assault, accounted for 396 cases (15%). Three quarters of detainees (547 of 686, 79%) alleging assaults had recent traumatic injuries. When we considered all detainees, medical examination showed recent traumatic injuries in 724 of 2694 (27%). Injured detainees were declared unfit for detention more frequently than non-injured non-assaulted detainees ( P < 0.05). These results strengthen the need and usefulness that the attending physician systematically takes note of detainees’ self reports of assaults and investigates recent traumatic injuries at the time of custody.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of mental illness among prisoners in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
Method: Mental illness was examined in two NSW prisoner populations: (i) new receptions to the correctional system; and (ii) sentenced prisoners. Reception prisoners were screened at four male centres and one female centre in NSW. The sentenced population was randomly selected from 28 correctional centres across the state. Reception prisoners were screened consecutively whenever possible while the sentenced group was randomly selected as part of the 2001 Inmate Health Survey. We adopted the same instrument, Composite International Diagnostic Interview – Auto (CIDI-A), for diagnosing mental illness as used in the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing.
Results: Overall, 43% of those screened had at least one of the following diagnoses: psychosis, anxiety disorder, or affective disorder. Reception prisoners suffered from mental illness to a greater extent than sentenced prisoners (46% vs. 38%). Women had higher levels of psychiatric morbidity than men (61% vs. 39%). Nine percent (9%) of all prisoners had experienced psychotic symptoms (due to any cause) in the prior 12 months. Twenty percent (20%) of all prisoners had suffered from at least one type of mood disorder and 36% had experienced an anxiety disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder was the most common disorder, diagnosed in 26% of receptions and 21% of sentenced prisoners.
Conclusions: These findings confirm that prisoners are a highly mentally disordered group compared with the general community. Given the high prevalence of mental illness identified by this study, it is essential that prison mental health services be adequately resourced to address the demand and, at minimum, ensure that mental health does not deteriorate during incarceration.

N2  - Background: Perceived health is a subjective measure of an individual's health based on self-reported, and self-knowledge about one's health status. It is related to one's functional status, morbidity, and mortality and serves as an important indicator in determining an individual's health status and health-related quality of life. The main purpose of this study is to explore (i) how a sample of adult inmates perceived their health and (ii) identify factors that may be associated with their perceived health. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study, where data collection involved the use of a structured questionnaire. The study sites were six prisons. A total of 144 inmates, 13 women (14%) and 131 men (91%) took part in the study. Results: The odds of having perceived good health were reduced by increasing age of the inmate (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.98) and increased by high level of education (OR = 4.11, 95% CI = 1.09-15.50) and long time spent in prison (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.09-15.50), adjusting for ethnicity and a previous history of murder/manslaughter (p > .02). In the same adjusted analysis, the odds of perceived good health were decreased with medium high and high depressive score (OR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02-0.17 and OR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.00-0.48, respectively). Conclusions: Psychological distress, time spent in prison, level of education and age were independent predictors of perceived health. High levels of psychological distress predict poor perceived health. Low level of education predict poor perceived health, while time spent in prison and age predict good perceived health.

N2  - We examined factors associated with increased mortality in a cohort of 85,203 adults with a history of imprisonment in New South Wales, Australia, between 1988 and 2002. Information on death was collected through linkage to the Australian National Death Index. The influence of demographic and criminological factors on the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for all-cause mortality, and deaths due to drug overdose and suicide was examined using negative binomial regression models. The number of deaths identified was 5,137 (4,714 men, 423 women, 303 in custody). The overall SMR was 3.7 (3.6–3.8) in men and 7.8 (7.1–8.5) in women. SMRs raised for deaths due to drug overdose (men: 12.8, women: 50.3) and suicide (men: 4.8, women: 12.2). The high SMR was associated with hospitalisation for mental illness, multiple imprisonments, and early stage of follow-up independently of causes of death. Being released from prison increased the SMRs for all-cause and drug-related mortality, but not suicide. For women, significant trends for decreasing risk with increasing age were noted. Minority groups, in particular men, had a lower risk of death than white people. In men a sex or drug offence was associated with a lower risk and a property or violence offence was related to higher mortality. Our results reinforce how disadvantaged prisoners are, measured by mortality as the most fundamental scale of human wellbeing. Certain demographic and imprisonment characteristics are indicators of high mortality among this population. The underlying causes of some of these characteristics such as mental illness or multiple imprisonments are potentially treatable and preventable. Prison health services need to develop interventions targeting high-risk groups to avoid this situation.

N2  - The American system of prisons and prisoners—described by its critics as the prison–industrial complex—has grown rapidly since 1970. Increasingly punitive sentencing guidelines and the privatization of prison-related industries and services account for much of this growth.
Those who enter and leave this system are increasingly Black or Latino, poorly educated, lacking vocational skills, struggling with drugs and alcohol, and disabled. Few correctional facilities mitigate the educational and/or skills deficiencies of their inmates, and most inmates will return home to communities that are ill equipped to house or rehabilitate them.
A more humanistic and community-centered approach to incarceration and rehabilitation may yield more beneficial results for individuals, communities, and, ultimately, society.

N2  - Abstract Introduction The physiology of many sudden, unexpected arrest-related deaths (ARDs) proximate to restraint has not been elucidated. A sudden decrease in central venous return during restraint procedures could be physiologically detrimental. The impact of body position and applied weight force on central venous return has not been previously studied. In this study, we use ultrasound to measure the size of the inferior vena cava (IVC) as a surrogate of central venous return in the standing position, prone position, and with weight force applied to the thorax in the prone position. Methods This was a prospective, observational study of volunteer human subjects. The IVC was visualized from the abdomen in both the longitudinal and transverse section in the standing and prone positions without weight force applied, and with 100 lbs (45 kg) and 147 lbs (67 kg) of weight force on the upper back in the prone position. Maximum and minimum measurements were determined in each section to account for possible respiratory variation of the IVC. Results The IVC significantly decreased in size with each successive change: from standing to prone, from prone to prone with 100 lbs (45 kg) weight compression, from prone with 100 lbs (45 kg) weight compression to prone with 147 lbs (67 kg) weight compression ( p < 0.0001). The vital sign measurements had no statistical change. Conclusions The physiology involved in many sudden, unexpected ARDs has not been elucidated. However, in our study, we found a significant decrease in IVC diameter with weight force compression to the upper thorax when the subject was in the prone position. This may have implications for the tactics of restraint to aid in the prevention of sudden, unexpected ARD cases.

N2  - This chapter considers how dominant forms of contemporary punishment are enacted and practiced, and how they are experienced. It focuses primarily on imprisonment as one of our favourite forms of punishment, looking at how penal practices are legitimised-that is, how we have come to accept carceral spaces as necessary, useful and unavoidable features of contemporary life-and how experiences of incarceration are navigated by the punished. The first part of the chapter explores the means of contemporary carceral expansion, discussing how the pervasive presence of punishment within and beyond criminal justice reflects its modern presentation as a useful and necessary institution that is nevertheless constantly in crisis, and therefore constantly in need of more resources, more attention and new sites and technologies. Paying attention to the link between punishment and crisis thus helps us to understand how punishment develops, expands and perpetuates itself. The second part of the chapter turns to an examination of how punishment is felt and experienced by those who are subjected to it. It draws on scholarship on the pains of imprisonment to enquire into the embodied character of punishment, and how it shapes the identities and lived experiences of the punished. This second part finishes by looking into the rehabilitative ideal within punishment, and the potential for resistance.
This chapter considers how dominant forms of contemporary punishment are enacted and practiced, and how they are experienced. It focuses primarily on imprisonment as the dominant and most widely favoured form of punishment, looking at how penal practices are legitimised-that is, how people have come to accept carceral spaces as necessary, useful and unavoidable features of contemporary life-and how experiences of incarceration are navigated by the punished. The chapter argues that the general outlook, purpose and consequences of the prison become paradigmatic of how punishment is engendered and perpetuated, so that even when people do not resort to imprisonment, they seek to perform punishment in the prison's image-that is, they punish carcerally. It starts with a general look at the question 'how', exploring how they structure, perform and legitimise practices of punishment, and end by looking more closely at lived experiences of incarceration.

N2  - Objective: Describe health risks/obstacles to health among correctional employees. Methods: Mixed-methods approach combined results from four focus groups, 10 interviews, 335 surveys, and 197 physical assessments. Results: Obesity levels were higher than national averages (40.7% overweight and 43.3% obese), with higher levels associated with job tenure, male gender, and working off-shift. Despite widespread concern about the lack of fitness, leisure exercise was higher than national norms. Respondents had higher levels of hypertension than national norms, with 31% of men and 25.8% of women hypertensive compared with 17.1% and 15.1% for national norms. Stress levels were elevated. Officers related their stress to concerns about security, administrative requirements, and work/family imbalance. High stress levels are reflected in elevated levels of hypertension. Conclusions: Correctional employees are at high risk for chronic disease, and environmental changes are needed to reduce risk factors.

N2  - We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV Counseling and Testing System data from 2007 to determine the percentage and characteristics of persons newly identified as HIV-positive in US correctional facilities. The newly identified HIV positivity was 0.7%, and 30% of detainees newly identified with HIV were categorized as having low-risk heterosexual contact or no acknowledged risk. Correctional facilities should provide detainees with routine opt-out HIV testing, unless the prevalence of previously undiagnosed HIV infection has been documented to be less than 0.1%.

N2  - The study of security within a prison environment implies the observation of a complex phenomenon: on the one hand, inmates are defined as agents of insecurity, insofar as they are the authors of criminal acts, which to the outside world represent everything that is perceived as a threat – in terms of the law, order and general well‐being. On the other hand, the prison is often characterised as a space riddled with fear, uncertainty and insecurity, manifest in the everyday life of prisons. In this article, based on a two‐year fieldwork in three Portuguese male prisons, I explore the meaning attributed to security from inmates’ perspectives and discourses. This analysis, which includes inmates with different ages, origins, types of crime and sentence length, as well as specificities inherent to the chosen field sites, allows us to expand and deepen our understanding of the significance of security within a population that is often excluded from this discussion, albeit invariably related with it.
L'insécurité proche: les conceptions de la sécurité fluide dans la détention prisonnière
L'étude de la sécurité au sein d'un environnement carcéral implique l'observation d'un phénomène complexe : d'une part, les détenus sont définis comme des agents d'insécurité, dans la mesure où ils sont les auteurs d'actes criminels, qui à l'extérieur représentent tout ce qui est perçu comme une menace ‐ en termes de la loi, d'ordre et de bien‐être général. D'autre part, la prison est souvent caractérisée comme un espace criblé de peur, d'incertitude et d'insécurité, qui se manifeste dans la vie quotidienne des prisons. Dans cet article, basé sur un travail de terrain de deux ans dans trois prisons pour hommes portugais, j'explore la signification attribuée à la sécurité à partir des discours et points de vue des détenus. L'analyse comprend des détenus ayant différents âges, origines, types de criminalité et de durée de leurs peines, ainsi que les spécificités inhérentes aux sites de domaine choisi. Elle nous permet d'élargir et d'approfondir notre compréhension de l'importance de la sécurité au sein d'une population qui est souvent exclue de cette discussion, mais toujours liés avec elle.

N2  - Primary objective : To determine the prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among inmates in a county jail population. Research design : Cross-sectional, observational study. Methods and procedures : A standardized interview was used to determine prevalence of TBI in 69 randomly selected inmates. To examine cognitive and emotional differences between subjects with and without recent TBI, neuropsychological tests and structured psychiatric diagnostic interviews were conducted with 50 subjects (the first 25 with TBI and the first 25 without TBI in the prior year). Results : Sixty (87.0%) reported TBI over their lifetime; 25 (36.2%) reported TBI in the prior year. The latter group had significantly worse anger and aggression scores and had a trend towards poorer cognitive test results and a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders than the group without TBI in the prior year. Conclusion : This study suggests the need for increased attention to TBI and its cognitive, behavioural and psychiatric sequelae in jail populations.

N2  - It is estimated that up to one-fourth of the people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States pass through a correctional facility each year. The majority of persons who enter a correctional facility today will return home in the near future. Most inmates with HIV infection acquire it in the outside community; prison does not seem to be an amplifying reservoir. How correctional health services deal with the HIV-infected person has important implications to the overall care of HIV-infected people in the community. Routine HIV testing is well accepted. Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with a reduction in mortality in prisons. A link between area HIV specialists and correctional health care providers is an important partnership for ensuring that HIV-infected patients have optimal care both inside prison and after release.

N2  - Background Work ability is predicted by age- and work-related psychosocial hazards; however, its association with work experience has not been studied. Work ability has not been studied in prison environments as well.
Aims To describe work ability and its associates among prison workers.
Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in two prisons in Spain, one large and one medium prison, randomly selected from 17 in total. Prison workers were randomly administered a voluntary anonymous questionnaire to measure work ability [Work Ability Index (WAI)], work-related psychosocial hazards (Spanish version of COPSOQ), sociodemographic, lifestyle and work-related variables.
Results Four hundred and forty-one workers (54%) participated. Results confirmed that older and more experienced workers (analysis of variance analysis) and workers in large prisons (t-student) presented significantly lower WAI scores. Quantitative and emotional demands, family work conflict, low work control, low autonomy, low social support from colleagues and stress had negative significant associations with WAI. Age, which highly correlated with work experience (Spearman's r = 0.85), had significant association with WAI (beta = −0.62). In the stepwise linear regression, the association between age and WAI lost statistical significance after controlling for work experience, which maintained significant correlation with WAI (beta = −0.37).
Conclusions The apparent association between age and WAI was confounded by work experience. Interventions to improve work ability among prison workers may benefit from results of this study to focus their efforts on the risk groups in such a psychologically demanding wok environment rarely examined in previous research.

N2  - Each year, more than 10 million people enter US jails, most returning home within a few weeks. Because jails concentrate people with infectious and chronic diseases, substance abuse, and mental health problems, and reentry policies often exacerbate these problems, the experiences of people leaving jail may contribute to health inequities in the low-income communities to which they return.
Our study of the experiences in the year after release of 491 adolescent males and 476 adult women returning home from New York City jails shows that both populations have low employment rates and incomes and high rearrest rates. Few received services in jail. However, overall drug use and illegal activity declined significantly in the year after release. Postrelease employment and health insurance were associated with lower rearrest rates and drug use. Public policies on employment, drug treatment, housing, and health care often blocked successful reentry into society from jail, suggesting the need for new policies that support successful reentry into society.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  Few studies have examined the statistical association between methamphetamine/amphetamine use and acquisitive crime. Both methamphetamine/amphetamine and cannabis use have been implicated by New Zealand Police as factors in acquisitive offending among active criminal populations. The aim of our study was to examine the statistical association between spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine and cannabis and earnings from acquisitive crime among police detainees in New Zealand.
Setting  Four police stations in different regions.
Participants  A sample of 2125 police detainees were interviewed about their drug use and acquisitive crime.
Design  Statistical models were developed to predict involvement in acquisitive crime using spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine and cannabis for personal use, and to examine associations between the level of spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine and cannabis for personal use and level of dollar earnings from acquisitive crime.
Measurements  Self‐reported spending on drug use and self‐reported earnings from acquisitive crime in the past 30 days.
Findings  Spending on cannabis and methamphetamine/amphetamine could predict involvement in acquisitive crime. Level of spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine and cannabis was associated positively with the level of earnings from property crime. Level of spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine was also associated positively with level of earnings from drug dealing. There was a largely negative association between level of spending on cannabis and level of earnings from drug dealing.
Conclusions  High spending on methamphetamine/amphetamine is associated statistically with higher earnings from acquisitive crime among police detainees. Further research into this association, and in particular the causal nature of the association, is required to obtain clear policy recommendations.

N2  - Within forty years of her efforts, U.S. jails went from containing large numbers of poorly treated prisoners with mental illness to the point where they constituted only 0.7 per cent of inmates.1 Further and ongoing efforts to provide humane and enlightened treatment for people with mental illness resulted in the construction of a large number of state and provincial psychiatric hospitals across North America. Unfortunately, and for various reasons, the intended comprehensive community support systems that were meant to be in place either did not materialize, materialized and then evaporated, or were just insufficient to manage the flood of patients with mental illness now living in the community, and later on the streets.4 Unfortunately, too, along with the reduction in psychiatric beds in Canada and the United States (and much of the industrialized world), an increase began in the number of people with mental illness within the also enlarging criminal justice system.5 The information about the increasing numbers of people with mental illness in the criminal justice system was slow to come to light, manifesting in the 1970s. The increase of people with mental illness within the criminal justice system appeared to correspond with the reduction in psychiatric beds,6 and the notion that people with mental illness were becoming criminalized became better publicized.7 Along with the increasing number of people with mental illness in jails and prisons came the myriad of associated problems, such as victimization of incarcerated people with mental illness and difficulty getting timely psychiatric care. [...] it was likely in 1970 that the first reports of increasing numbers of people with mental illness in jails and prisons started to emerge.

N2  - Civil society plays a vital role in providing services and advocating for vulnerable populations. This dissertation includes three papers that examine how civil society actors aim to fill in the gaps left by governmental and market failure to address social issues. These studies address human trafficking and environmental migration, complex human rights issues that suffer from a lack of precise definitions and entail providing services for displaced individuals. The findings highlight ways potential donors, NGOs, and labor unions offer promising avenues for combatting these issues. However, the results also illustrate different types of failures within civil society, highlighting areas for improvement in how these actors should better serve marginalized people.Following an introduction, the first paper examines dominant narratives of human trafficking in the United States. Sensational stories of human trafficking perpetuate a narrative that often misrepresents the true nature of the problem. These stories typically depict a young girl or woman who is sex trafficked and overshadow other cases, such as the labor trafficking of boys and men. The widespread dissemination of these stories from the media, news, and political discourse shapes the public’s understanding of what it looks like. Do these stories also affect who donors perceive as most deserving of their aid? This is an important question because civil society is essential to anti-trafficking efforts in the United States. Furthermore, civil society plays a critical role in anti-trafficking policymaking. Thus, it’s necessary to understand if donor preferences align with these dominant narratives.I conduct a nationally representative survey experiment of potential U.S. donors to examine this. I ask individuals to choose between two fictitious charities to donate to, each serving a different type of trafficking survivor. I theorize that donors will be most likely to support legal services for young girls who are sex trafficked and are non-U.S. citizens. I find support for three out of five of my hypotheses. Overall, donors are most likely to support housing services for young girls who have been sex trafficked and are U.S. citizens.The second paper takes a closer look at labor trafficking in the United States. Labor trafficking remains a concealed and pervasive issue in the United States, overshadowed by the more recognized problem of sex trafficking. A recent analysis revealed that 80% of labor trafficking victims were migrant workers, underscoring the urgent need for attention. Employers often do not face pushback from migrant workers due to issues such as their fear of deportation, visa revocation, language barriers, and lack of community support. Thus, community activists and civil society play an important role in advocating for this population.In response to the prevailing human rights and carceral frameworks to address human trafficking, the paper advocates for a labor rights approach, positioning labor unions as central protectors of workers. I argue that labor protections warrant a collective voice because individual workers, especially migrants, lack the structural power to confront employers. Through a qualitative analysis of 100 U.S. labor union websites, this study explores whether and how these unions address labor trafficking and provide specific migrant protections. I find that unions in sectors with high immigrant salience, such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, are more likely to include online programming and information directed to migrant members and to protect members from labor exploitation.The third paper turns to environmental migration to assess how migration and refugee organizations in the United States engage with this issue. Climate change is causing widespread environmental degradation and increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, leading to displacement and migration. However, limitations in international refugee law and growing xenophobia decrease the likelihood of sufficient state action in providing environmental migrants with essential services necessary for everyday living. In response to government failure, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) will likely emerge as crucial actors in providing services for and advocating on behalf of environmental migrants. What factors are associated with migration and refugee organizations expanding their work to invest in the link between climate change and migration? This question will only become more significant as climate change worsens.Using data from organization websites and public tax forms, I analyze this question by creating an original dataset of 110 migration and refugee organizations in the United States. This study focuses on organizations that serve cross-border environmental migrants rather than internally displaced persons. I further analyze the driving mechanisms by conducting four in-depth interviews - two with organizations that do indicate investing in environmental migration on their website and two with organizations that do not. My findings support a supply-side theory that suggests that more revenue significantly influences whether an organization actively invests in programs and advocacy focused on environmental migration. I theorize that organizations with more significant financial capacity can go beyond low-cost virtue signaling about their commitment to environmental justice and instead invest resources in this issue. On the contrary, I do not find support for the demand-side theory, where I posited that organizations working in countries more vulnerable to climate change are more likely to invest in environmental migration.

N2  - We investigated the circumstances and psychological processes involved in the near-lethal self-harm acts of 60 women prisoners, using qualitative and quantitative methods. Most incidents involved hanging or ligaturing and high levels of suicidal ideation, and were attributable to individual and prison-related factors. Half of the incidents were described as impulsive, but mostly occurred against a background of longer-term suicidality and multiple repeated attempts. Hopelessness and images of past trauma were common in the lead-up to the acts. These findings have implications for prevention of suicidal behaviour in female prisoners.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE —A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to investigate the clinical and economic impact of teleophthalmology in evaluating
diabetic retinopathy in prison inmates with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS —Based on a hypothetical teleophthalmology system to evaluate diabetic retinopathy patients with type 2 diabetes in a prison
care setting, a Markov decision model was developed with probability and cost data derived primarily from published epidemiological
and outcome studies. A 40-year-old African-American man with type 2 diabetes was used as a reference case subject. The number
of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was used as the clinical outcome, and the cost in U.S. dollars from the year
2003 was used as the economic outcome. Teleophthalmology and nonteleophthalmology strategies were compared using an expected
QALYs calculation and two types of sensitivity analyses: probabilistic and traditional n -way sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS —The teleophthalmology strategy dominates in the cost-effectiveness analysis for the reference case subject: $16,514/18.73
QALYs for teleophthalmology and $17,590/18.58 QALYs for nonteleophthalmology. Ninety percent of the Monte Carlo simulations
showed cost effectiveness (annual cost/QALYs ≤$50,000) in the teleophthalmology strategy based on an assumed inmate population.
Teleophthalmology is the better strategy if the number of diabetic inmates in the prison community is >500.
CONCLUSIONS —Our cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that teleophthalmology holds great promise to reduce the cost of inmate care
and reduce blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients.

N2  - Objective
We examined positive and negative religious coping as moderators of the relation between physical limitations, depression, and desire for hastened death among male inmates incarcerated primarily for murder.
Methods
Inmates over the age of 45 years who passed a cognitive screening completed face‐to‐face interviews (N = 94; mean age = 57.7 years; SD = 10.68). Multiple regression analyses included age, race/ethnicity, parole belief, physical health, positive or negative religious coping, and all two‐way interactions represented by the product of health and a religious coping variable.
Results
Older inmates and those who reported greater levels of positive religious coping endorsed fewer symptoms of depression, whereas those who reported greater levels of negative religious coping endorsed more symptoms of depression. Inmates who reported higher levels of depression endorsed a greater desire for hastened death. The effect of physical functioning on desire for hastened death is moderated by negative religious coping such that those who endorsed higher levels of negative religious coping reported a greater desire for hastened death.
Conclusions
Examinations of religious/spiritual practices and mindfulness‐based interventions in prison research have assumed a positive stance with regard to the potential impact of religious/spiritual coping on physical and mental health. The current findings provide cautionary information that may further assist in selection of inmates for participation in such interventions. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - ABSTRACTThe aim of this study was to prospectively examine whether psychotic-like symptoms (PLSs) are positively associated with violent recidivism and whether this relation is stronger when PLSs co-occur with substance use disorders (SUDs). Participants were 224 detained male adolescents from all youth detention centers in Flanders. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to assess PLSs and the number of SUDs. Two to 4 years later, information on official recidivism was obtained. Although hallucinations were unrelated to violent recidivism, paranoid delusions (PDs) and threat/control override delusions (TCODs) were negatively related to violent recidivism. The relation between PLSs and violent recidivism did not become stronger in the presence of SUDs. Detained youths with PLSs do not have a higher risk for violent recidivism than detained youths without PLSs. In contrast, by identifying detained youths with PDs or TCODs, clinicians are likely to identify youths with a low risk for future violent crimes.

N2  - Abstract This study examined the impact of prison-initiated methadone maintenance at 12 months postrelease. Males with preincarceration heroin dependence ( N = 204) were randomly assigned to (a) Counseling Only: counseling in prison, with passive referral to treatment upon release; (b) Counseling + Transfer: counseling in prison with transfer to methadone maintenance treatment upon release; and (c) Counseling + Methadone: counseling and methadone maintenance in prison, continued in the community upon release. The mean number of days in community-based drug abuse treatment were, respectively, Counseling Only, 23.1; Counseling + Transfer, 91.3; and Counseling + Methadone, 166.0 ( p < .01); all pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (all p s < .01). Counseling + Methadone participants were also significantly less likely than participants in each of the other two groups to be opioid-positive or cocaine-positive according to urine drug testing. These results support the effectiveness of prison-initiated methadone for males in the United States. Further study is required to confirm the findings for women.

N2  - Philadelphia has a long and tragic history of redlining and disinvestment, impacting African American residents at disproportionate rates. Neighborhoods where African Americans and other communities of color have lived have lost opportunities to green spaces, clean air, quality education, and healthy food retailers. Redlining and disinvestment can also lead to higher rates of crime, violence, and policing. The relationship between redlining, food access, and incarceration shows the way marginalized groups have been targeted by unjust policing and unhealthy circumstances. This thesis examines the relationship between redlining, food access, and incarceration in Philadelphia neighborhoods. By speaking with field experts in food access, food justice, and the carceral justice system, I present a case study of Philadelphia and how decades of disinvestment have led to neighborhoods with low access to quality healthy foods and high rates of pedestrian stop and frisk incidents, gentrification, and policing. I then offer four recommendations for policymakers nationwide to end disinvestment and increase food access: reduce poverty, create accessible and affordable food production, address the impacts of climate change on food, and reverse the links between food, policing, and incarceration.

N2  - Abstract Background Whilst impulsivity is most commonly linked to the development of internalizing disorders, high levels of impulsivity, anxiety, and depression have been found in detained juvenile offenders. We therefore sought to determine whether impulsivity is associated with the development of self-reported anxiety or depression in a sample of detained juvenile offenders. Methods 323 male juvenile offenders and 86 typically developing controls, aged 15–17 were assessed. The Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime (SADS-PL) was used to assess psychiatric diagnoses, the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) was used to measure impulsivity, and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the Birleson Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) were used to assess self-reported anxiety and depression respectively. Results Compared to controls, juvenile offenders had significantly higher scores on the BIS-11 total, as well as on the motor and nonplanning subscales (all p values <0.001), as well as higher DSRS ( p < 0.001) and SCARED ( p < 0.05) scores. Within the juvenile offender group, scores on the SCARED correlated positively with BIS-11 total, attention subscale, motor subscale, and total DSRS (all p values <0.01). DSRS scores correlated positively with BIS-11 total, attention subscale, nonplanning subscale, and total SCARED scores (all p values <0.01). Participants were then categorized low, middle or high impulsivity according to scores on the BIS-11. One-way ANOVAs demonstrated a significant difference between these tertiles on DSRS [F(2,320) = 4.862, p < 0.05] and SCARED total scores [F(2,320) = 3.581, p < 0.05]. Specifically, post-hoc analyses found that the high impulsivity tertile scored significant higher than the remaining tertiles on both DSRS (16.1 ± 0.3 vs. 14.0 ± 0.6, p < 0.05) and SCARED (23.3 ± 0.9 vs. 18.4 ± 1.4, p < 0.05) scores. Using multiple linear regression, BIS-11 attention scores, number of months served in custody, age, and BIS-11 nonplanning scores predicted higher levels of anxiety, whilst only BIS-11 attention and nonplanning scores predicted higher levels of depression. Conclusions In detained juvenile offenders, high impulsivity may be an important risk factor not only for the externalizing disorders, but also for anxiety and depression. Results of this study, therefore, suggest that specific facets of impulsivity may represent one mechanism underlying the emergence of anxiety and depression in this population.

N2  - Abstract Use of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) has been associated with adverse psychiatric effect, violent behavior, and criminality. The aim of this study was to further investigate the motives for and consequences of AAS use, with focus on violent and antisocial behavior. Fifty-nine prisoners were interviewed on their use of AAS, and their history was mapped with Addiction Severity Index interviews. Of these prisoners, 56% admitted previous use of AAS, of whom 24% declared to have committed violent crimes in connection with use of AAS. However, the only significant difference between users and nonusers with regard to criminal history when measured with the Addiction Severity Index was that the AAS users more often stated that they had been prosecuted for crimes labeled as “other crimes,” which did not include violent crimes. The reported side effects of AAS corresponded well to those previously reported. These results indicate that use of AAS is common among Swedish prisoners and that the motives and consequences of such use are similar to what has been observed in other AAS-using populations. Furthermore, this study supports earlier notions that misuse of AAS might cause violent behavior, but only in certain individuals and mainly in combination with other substances.

N2  - Objective: In order to prevent suicidal behaviour among adolescents and young adults it would be valuable to know if altering the conditions of their upbringing could reduce their suicidal behaviour. The study surveys possible risk factors.
Method: Population‐based registers covering children born in Denmark in 1966 at the age span of 14–27 years and their parents for: health, education, family dissolution, suicidal behaviour, substance abuse, criminality and unemployment. A discrete‐time proportional hazard modelling was used to analyse the longitudinal observations.
Results: First‐time suicide attempts were associated with parental psychiatric disorder, suicidal behaviour, violence, child abuse and neglect. Increased risks were also found among adolescents and young adults who suffered from psychiatric disorder or physical handicap, had been legally imprisoned, were addicted to drugs, or without graduation, vocational training or employment.
Conclusion: Stigmatization, social exclusion, and mental disorders in the adolescents or young adults and parents increased risks for attempted suicide.

N2  - Background: Older prisoners are a minority within the prison population but their numbers are increasing at a greater rate than any other age group. The mental health of younger prisoners has been well researched but this is not the case for older inmates. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the existing literature on the mental health of older prisoners. Methods: Relevant papers were identified through database searches and an examination of cited references in the selected papers. The literature was divided into different sections in order to examine the contributing factors and rates of mental illness in older prisoners. Results: The first section looks at demographic factors relevant to older prisoners. Subsequent sections examine psychosocial factors, environmental factors and physical health factors that may have a detrimental effect on mental health. The final sections look at the prevalence of mental illness in older offenders before and after sentencing. Conclusions: Mental illness in older prisoners is a result of complex interactions between numerous individual and environmental factors. It currently remains poorly researched and service provision for older prisoners with mental illness is poorly developed. Further research is needed, with a particular focus on the different groups of older prisoners and the most beneficial service models, because the number of older prisoners, including those with mental illness, is likely to increase in the future.

N2  - The mental health needs of children and adolescents in secure care are a matter of concern, but little systematic research has been done. Our aim was to assess the mental health, social, and educational needs of these young people in a prospective, longitudinal study.
We enrolled 97 boys aged 12–17 years who had been admitted to secure care. We assessed their needs (n=97) at the time of admission and 3 months later (n=90) with standardised interviews and psychometric tests.
26 (27%) boys had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of less than 70. The need for psychiatric help was high on admission to a secure unit, with the most frequent disorders being depression and anxiety. There were high rates of aggression, substance misuse, self harm, and social, family, and educational problems, and associated needs. The mean number of needs was 8·5 (SD 2·9) on admission and 2·9 (SD 2·4) after 3 months (mean difference 5·6, 95% CI 5·0–6·3). Areas in which needs were mostly met included education, substance misuse, self care, and diet. Areas where the frequency of need fell substantially, but remained high, were social and family problems, and aggressive behaviours. Psychological needs persisted, with new onsets of depression, anxiety problems, and post-traumatic-stress symptoms shortly after admission. The most frequently required interventions were psychological assessment and cognitive behavioural work.
Boys in secure care have many needs and a high rate of psychiatric morbidity. During the admission period, secure care units address some domains of need, but others remain unchanged or get worse. Psychological and psychiatric provision in secure units need to be improved.

N2  - We conducted a prospective study to investigate access to treatment in hepatitis C in 268 prisoners. Hepatitis C positivity had been known for 182 prisoners previously and 19 reported previous attempts to treat (10%). In comparison, during our study, 86/268 prisoners (32%) started therapy (P < 0.0001). They represented 41% of 211 prisoners with a positive viral load. In the genotype 2 or 3 group, 46 prisoners (50%) started therapy versus 40 prisoners (33%) with other genotypes (P = 0.01). This difference was due to prisoners waiting for liver biopsy. On an intention to treat basis, 45 prisoners (52%) achieved sustained virological response 6 months after the end of therapy. We conclude that a stay in prison is an effective opportunity to treat a group of hepatitis C patients which otherwise have very limited access to therapy.

N2  - This culturally and politically timely collection examines new Black films and moving images that have, once again, excited and possibly shifted the global media landscape.
At a moment some scholars have described as post-post-racial, Black Cinema & Visual Culture provides new, urgent definitions and theories for Black cinema and furthers the development of its critical discourses. Gathering some of the leading scholars and critics in the field, this book enriches and advances the study of Black film and media and its social and political implications at a breakthrough period of expansion in the 21st century. This anthology tackles a wide range of topics from social justice, new media, and Afrofuturism, to race, gender, sexuality, mass incarceration, cultural memory, and Afrosurrealism, exploring the current climate of Black cinematic art that has proven wildly popular with domestic and global audiences, including hit films like Get Out and Marvel's Black Panther. Together, these essays deepen understandings of Black visual culture, its creative image-makers, the political economy of Hollywood, and the cultural politics at the intersection of modern cinema, streaming platforms, and digital technologies.
Black Cinema & Visual Culture will serve as an important learning tool for university courses spanning topics in film studies, American film and television, cultural studies, American studies, African Diaspora studies, media activism, social analysis, and African-American studies. This volume will also provide a benchmark in popular and intellectual circles for anyone interested in popular culture, Black-American cinema, media, issues of race in Hollywood, or Black culture and the conditions that shape both its art and politics.

N2  - Rates of self-harm/suicide in prisons are high and procedures for the management of risk are important in reducing such rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate a pilot initiative developed to improve the management of those at risk of self-harm/suicide (Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork [ACCT]). The method involved reception screening, clinical presentations of prisoners, care planning and mental health provision for prisoners at risk being compared before and after the pilot. The results were as follows: At reception, there was no change in the proportion of prisoners with suicidal ideation who were placed on an at risk document. While in prison, ACCTs being more likely to be opened following factors indicative of risk rather than actual self-harm and were more likely to contain 'quality' entries suggesting improved care of and engagement with vulnerable prisoners. While under the care of an at risk system, a higher proportion of prisoners were likely to be receiving primary mental health care input prior to ACCT implementation and prisoners on ACCT were more likely to be depressed but to be receiving no mental health care. Post-closure reviews were significantly less likely after the introduction of ACCT. The ACCT was piloted followed by phased implementation across the prison estate and findings are discussed in relation to further policy developments.

N2  - Abstract Objective Although detained adolescent females show high rates of severe aggression, we know little about the long-term impact of this risk-behavior. Furthermore, qualitative differences in aggression between males and females argue for gender specific research. In contrast to males, females display aggressive acts more often towards themselves (inward aggression; self harm behavior) than towards others (outward aggression). Therefore, this prospective study investigated the prevalence and predictive validity of different types of aggression in detained adolescent females. Method Participants were 139 adolescent females (mean age 20.1) assessed at start of detention and 5 years later. Both inward and outward aggression subtypes were assessed twice using standardized instruments. Mutual relations over time were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling. Results High levels of all types of aggression were found repeatedly, suggesting substantial persistence over time. While inward aggression predicted both inward and outward aggression at follow-up, outward aggression was related to outward aggression only. Furthermore, the covert form of outward aggression only, and not the overt subtype, predicted outward aggression 5 years later. Conclusions This study suggests that aggression in detained adolescent females does not fade away, and should thus be given substantial clinical attention. In assessment, focus should also be on inward and covert subtypes. Further research should explore the necessity of developing gender-specific diagnostic instruments, treatment modules and risk assessment tools. When replicated, our findings may also bear implications for the classification of behavior disorders in adolescent females.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the use of primary care services by a prisoner population so as to understand the great number of demands and therefore to plan services oriented to the specific needs of these patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study of a sample of prisoners’ medical records. Setting: All Belgian prisons (n = 33). Patients: 513 patients over a total of 182 patient years, 3328 gneral practitioner (GP) contacts, 3655 reasons for encounter. Main results: Prisoners consulted the GP 17 times a year on average (95%CI 15 to 19.4). It is 3.8 times more than a demographically equivalent population in the community. The most common reasons for encounter were administrative procedures (22%) followed by psychological (13.1%), respiratory (12.9%), digestive (12.5%), musculoskeletal (12%), and skin problems (7.7%). Psychological reasons for consultations (n = 481) involved mainly (71%) feeling anxious, sleep disturbance, and prescription of psychoactive drugs. Many other visits concerned common problems that in other circumstances would not require any physician intervention. Conclusion: The most probable explanations for the substantial use of primary care in prison are the health status (many similarities noted between health problems at the admission and reasons for consultations during the prison term: mental health problems and health problems related to drug misuse), lack of access to informal health services (many contacts for common problems), prison rules (many consultations for administrative procedures), and mental health problems related to the difficulties of life in prison.

N2  - “All Kinds of Money”: Black Women on the Move and the Policing of Urban Alley Workers, 1900-1935 is a story about labor refusal, informal wage earning, and the rise of “criminal” identification in North America. My dissertation examines the migration, working, and carceral histories of Black women dubbed by police and press as “rollers” and “alley workers.” By the turn of the 20th century, white newspaper outlets regularly printed articles with headlines such as “Rolled by a Negress,” “Caught White Man in Alley,” and “Gang of Negresses Prey On White Men.” The racializing and labeling of rollers as a professional “criminal” class evolved from the everyday police complaints that came from white male Johns reporting that a “negress prostitute” had picked their pockets for a wallet or roll of cash.As a unique form of underground labor resistance, rolling Johns reflected an unorthodox picket line, a general strike, or an uprising against the criminalization and economic exploitation of Black women’s sexuality. Instead of a set wage, rollers insisted that men pay with all the cash they carried, even if it meant their last cent. I weave prison and police files, newspapers, and maps together to provide a social, legal, and geographical history of urban rollers and alley workers in North America between 1900 and 1935. I follow Nettie Weems—a notorious roller marked by police in as many as 12 different cities from Chicago to Vancouver to California—over a 20 year period. Weems’ migration and working history provides an alternative narrative to the Great Migration settlement story. Organized in four parts, each with two chapters, I map Black women’s migration patterns; how they confronted sex work and how they were policed and prosecuted in the urban city.Part One, “Looking for a Fugitive Negress” examines Black women on the move and the rise of criminal identification in North America from the 1850’s to the 1930’s. This part begins with a teenage Weems on the run as a “fugitive from Justice” in Chicago in 1914. Part Two, “Has Pictures of her in Various Cities,” follows Weems across the border to British Columbia, Canada in 1925 where one Black migrant woman stated there was “all kinds of money” in Vancouver’s underground sex economy. I reveal how police identification and surveillance technologies, including fingerprints and mug shots, followed migrant sex workers across city, state, and international borders. Police tracking also illuminates the extreme mobility of rollers in North America in the early 20th century.The third part, “Police Have Declared War,” examines the social construction of urban rollers and alley workers and the aggressive city wide campaigns targeting Black women. Chapters five and six highlight Weems’ migration from Vancouver back across the US border to Washington then to Sacramento where she hides out as a fugitive in 1925 before serving a four year prison term at San Quentin State Prison in California. The final part, “Comet in its Orbital Track” follows Weems out of prison in California where she travels back to British Columbia and up and down the pacific west coast during the Great Depression. During this period, Weems served a prison term in Canada and Washington state for rolling Johns. Police in many cities on the West coast had a record of her career as a roller, fugitive, and formerly imprisoned woman. The concluding chapters uses arrest records to map and illuminate the impact of policing and vagrancy laws on the forced and unforced migrations of Black itinerant sex workers like Nettie Weems.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Journal publications and conference presentations on prison‐based syringe exchange (PSE) programmes were identified by a comprehensive search of electronic databases. Experts involved with development and evaluation of current PSE programmes or policy were contacted for reports, documents and unpublished material. Spanish information on PSE was translated for this review. We identified 14 papers specifically on PSE programmes in Switzerland (six papers), Germany (four) and Spain (four). The first PSE programme started in 1992 in Switzerland. As of December 2000, seven PSEs were operating in Switzerland, seven in Germany and five in Spain. There have been six evaluations of prison syringe exchange programmes and all have been favourable. Reports of drug use decreased or remained stable over time. Reports of syringe sharing declined dramatically. No new cases of HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C transmission were reported. The evaluations found no reports of serious unintended negative events, such as initiation of injection or of the use of needles as weapons. Staff attitudes were generally positive but response rates to these surveys varied. Overall, this review indicated that prison syringe exchange programmes are feasible and do provide benefit in the reduction of risk behaviour and the transmission of blood‐borne infection without any unintended negative consequences.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate sex and age correlates of chlamydia prevalence incarcerated populations.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of chlamydia prevalence by demographic characteristics from incarcerated females and males entering selected juvenile and adult correctional facilities (jails) in the United States in 2005.
Results: A total of 97,681 and 52,485 incarcerated persons aged >= 12 years were screened for chlamydia in 141 juvenile and 22 adult correctional facilities, respectively. Overall, chlamydia prevalence was high in females (14.3% and 7.5%) in both juvenile and adult facilities when compared with that in males (6.0% and 4.6%). The chlamydia prevalence was higher in incarcerated females than in incarcerated males for persons :535 years, and prevalence was highest among females aged :525 years (range, 11.3%-15.6%). In juvenile facilities, prevalence did not steadily increase with age in females (12.8% in 12-14 years, 15.1% in 15-17 years, and 14.3% in 18-20 years) whereas in males prevalence steadily increased with age (2.4% in 12-14 years to 8.7% in 18-20 years). In females and males the highest prevalence in juvenile facilities was in incarcerated blacks (18.4% and 9.6%, respectively). In adult facilities, the prevalence was consistently highest in younger detainees: in females it was 15.6% in 18- to 20-year olds compared with 1.5% in those >40 years; in males it was 8.8% in 18-to 20-year olds compared with 1.4% in those >40 years.

N2  - Faced with explosive growth in its prison population and a legal mandate
to improve medical care for incarcerated offenders, the state of Texas implemented
a novel correctional managed health care program in 1994. The organizational
structure of the program is based on a series of contractual relationships
between the state prison system, 2 of the state's academic medical centers,
and a separate governing body composed of 9 appointed members, which include
5 physicians. All medical, dental, and psychiatric care for more than 145 000
offenders, incarcerated under the jurisdiction of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, is provided by the University of Texas Medical Branch and
Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. The health delivery system is
composed of several levels of care, including primary ambulatory care clinics
in each prison unit, 16 infirmaries at strategic locations throughout the
state, several regional medical facilities, and a dedicated prison hospital
with a full range of services. Specialized treatment programs have been established
at various units for patients with chronic conditions, such as hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, major psychiatric disorders, hepatitis, and human immunodeficiency
virus infection. Significant improvements in health outcomes have occurred
since the managed care program was established.

N2  - Objectives: Few prospective studies are available on the relationship between incarceration and HIV risk among injection drug users (IDUs). The authors evaluated self-reported rates of syringe sharing and incarceration among a cohort of IDUs. Methods: This study analyzed syringe lending by HIV-infected IDUs and syringe borrowing by HIV-negative IDUs among participants enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS). Since serial measures for each individual were available, variables potentially associated with each outcome (syringe lending and borrowing) were evaluated using generalized estimating equations for binary outcomes. Results: The study sample consisted of 1,475 IDUs who were enrolled into the VIDUS cohort from May 1996 through May 2002. At baseline, 1,123 (76%) reported a history of incarceration since they first began injecting drugs. Of these individuals, 351 (31%) reported at baseline that they had injected drugs while incarcerated. Among 318 baseline HIV-infected IDUs, having been incarcerated in the six months prior to each interview remained independently associated with syringe lending during the same period (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06, 1.69; p=0.015). Similarly, among the 1,157 baseline HIV-negative IDUs, having been incarcerated in the six months prior to each interview remained independently associated with reporting syringe borrowing during the same period (adjusted OR=1.26; 95% CI 1.12, 1.44; p&lt0.001). Conclusions: Incarceration was independently associated with risky needle sharing for HIV-infected and HIV-negative IDUs. This evidence of HIV risk behavior should reinforce public health concerns about the high rates of incarceration among IDUs.

N2  - Objective: In animal models, formation of oxidants during postischemic reperfusion may exert deleterious effects ("oxidative stress"). Cardioplegic arrest/reperfusion during cardiac surgery might similarly induce oxidative stress. However, the phenomenon has not been precisely characterized in patients, and therefore the role of antioxidant therapy at cardiac surgery is a matter of debate. Thus, we wanted to ascertain whether the relationship between oxidant formation and development of myocardial injury also translates to the situation of patients subjected to cardioplegic arrest.
Methods: In 24 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass, trans-cardiac blood samples and myocardial biopsies were taken before cardioplegic arrest and again following reperfusion.
Results: Cardiac glutathione release (marker of oxidant production) was negligible at baseline (0.02 +/- 0.04 mu mol/L), but it increased 15 min into reperfusion (1.10 +/- 0.40 gmol/L;p < 0.05); concomitantly, myocardial concentration of the antioxidant ubiquinol decreased from 144.5 +/- 52.0 to 97.6 +/- 82.0 nmol/g (p < 0.05). Although these changes document cardiac exposure to oxidants, they were not accompanied by evidence of injury. Neither coronary sinus blood nor cardiac biopsies showed increased lipid peroxide concentrations. Furthermore, electron microscopy showed no major ultrastructural alterations. Finally, full recovery of left ventricular systolic and diastolic function was observed.
Conclusions: Careful investigation reveals that while oxidant production does occur during cardiac surgery in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease, cardiac oxidative stress may not progress through membrane damage and irreversible injury.

N2  - Research has focused on the environmental causes of bullying in prison, but neglected the intrinsic characteristics of bullies. Although the importance of social status in prison has been noted as one factor that may influence bullying, no empirical research has yet addressed this. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether the perceived importance of social status in prison motivates bullying, with the subsidiary aim of exploring whether moral disengagement and prisonization influence the relationship. A total of 132 adult male prisoners were interviewed and categorized as a bully, victim, bully/victim or not involved. The prevalence of bullying was high, with over half the prisoners being both a victim and perpetrator of bullying. As predicted, bullying was positively related to the perceived importance of social status; prisoners involved in bullying valued social status more than those who were not. Furthermore, moral disengagement mediated the relationship between bullying and social status. Prisonization was also related to the perceived importance of social status, moral disengagement and bullying. It is concluded that a desire to achieve social status in prison may contribute to bullying. Furthermore, prisonized attitudes may instill values such as social status into prisoners and may also help facilitate cognitive distortions such as moral disengagement, which in turn, may serve to maintain involvement in bullying activity.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To investigate heroin and cocaine use in a sample of British prisoners, and to explore the characteristics of inmates who use these drugs for the first time while in prison.
Design, participants  A cross‐sectional survey of all prisons in England and Wales conducted as part of a major national study of psychiatric morbidity. A total of 3142 prisoners (88.2% of those selected) completed a structured interviewer‐administered questionnaire.
Measurements  Interview measures of personal demographics, social history, psychiatric morbidity and drug use. Personality disorders were diagnosed via the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV (SCID‐II) and neurotic symptoms were assessed using the revised Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS‐R).
Findings  More than 60% of the heroin users and cannabis users reported that they had used these drugs in prison compared with less than a quarter of the life‐time cocaine users. More than a quarter of the heroin users reported that they had initiated use of this drug in prison. The extent of an individual's experience of prison was related more consistently to heroin and/or cocaine use in and out of prison than other personal background, social history or psychiatric variables assessed.
Conclusions  The findings indicate that prisons are a high‐risk environment for heroin and other drug initiation and use. Although related to drug use, psychiatric variables were not generally associated with initiation in prison, which was dominated by prison exposure. There is a need to explore ways of reducing heroin initiation in prison as part of a broader risk‐prevention strategy.

N2  - This dissertation interrogates hip-hop, particularly gangsta hip-hop, as a form of resistance to the intensified mechanisms of disciplinary power and explores what it means to live in a carceral system in which confinement, correction, and control are familiar parts of everyday life. I argue that hip-hop provides rich first-hand accounts of people negotiating carcerality. Using methods of critical discourse analysis, I trace themes of confinement and subjectivity across multiple hip-hop media (songs, videos, movies, and novels) to not only show the prevalence of such themes in the culture, but to argue for the potential that lies in paying attention to these productions. I argue that hip-hop’s attention to place, discussions of conditions of confinement and freedom, and constructions of complex subjectivities provide rich insight into what it means to live under modern day prison system. This dissertation shows that there is a ‘hood standpoint that is a locally produced critique of prisons, disciplinary technologies, and surveillance. This standpoint shows that the prison shapes the social imaginary of the ‘hood, structures the way people understand and represent time and space, and produces a set of looking relations that counter disciplinary surveillance. This project also shows that overlooked influences of U.S. third world feminism have actually structured the ways in which hip-hop artists attempt to carve out spaces of possibility and freedom in the ambiguous and contradictory space of the ‘hood. Lastly, this dissertation reveals that while hip-hop offers one of the most prescient critiques of disciplinary power, it has also helped to normalize many of the practices of surveillance, regulation, and control through the construction and maintenance of what I term the Bonnie script. However the Bonnie script also reveals the ways that Black women and girls attempt to break free from containment scripts that limit their lives. While these moments of resistance are fleeting, they reveal that people push back against carceral power even if there is no escape. Ultimately this project asks, what can change for critical prison studies by listening to the vernacular and local knowledges provided in hip-hop about carcerality?

N2  - This study examines the past year prevalence rate of psychiatric disorders in detained male adolescents and the relation between psychiatric disorders and type of offending. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-IV) was administered in a sample (
N
= 245) of male detained adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Based on lifetime official criminal history, participants were classified into property, violent, and versatile subgroups. High rates of psychiatric disorders were found in all groups. In addition, property offenders reported significantly higher rates of depression, disruptive behavior disorders, substance use disorders and comorbidity than violent and versatile offenders. Overall, versatile offenders did not differ from violent offenders, with the exception of more marijuana use disorder found in violent offenders. This study once more emphasizes that detained boys have substantial mental health needs, a finding that is generalizable across countries. In addition, the current study suggests that classifying detained juveniles by offense subgroups may carry clinical relevance. The long-term impact of these differences, and the possible effects of intervention, should be subject of further research.

N2  - Objectives. We assessed the association between homelessness and incarceration in Veterans Affairs patients with bipolar disorder.
Methods. We used logistic regression to model each participant's risk of incarceration or homelessness after we controlled for known risk factors.
Results. Of 435 participants, 12% reported recent homelessness (within the past month), and 55% reported lifetime homelessness. Recent and lifetime incarceration rates were 2% and 55%, respectively. In multivariate models, current medication adherence (based on a 5-point scale) was independently associated with a lower risk of lifetime homelessness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80 per point, range 0–4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66, 0.96), and lifetime incarceration increased the risk of lifetime homelessness (OR = 4.4; 95% CI = 2.8, 6.9). Recent homelessness was associated with recent incarceration (OR = 26.4; 95% CI = 5.2, 133.4). Lifetime incarceration was associated with current substance use (OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 2.7, 6.7) after control for lifetime homelessness (OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 2.7, 6.7).
Conclusions. Recent and lifetime incarceration and homelessness were strongly associated with each other. Potentially avoidable or treatable correlates included current medication nonadherence and substance use. Programs that better coordinate psychiatric and drug treatment with housing programs may reduce the cycle of incarceration, homelessness, and treatment disruption within this vulnerable patient population.

N2  - Abstract Purpose Over 25 reports have found outpatient frequency of sudden cardiac death peaks between 6 am and noon; few studies, with inconsistent results, have examined circadian variation of death in hospitalized patients. This study assesses circadian variation in cardiopulmonary arrest of in-hospital patients across patient, hospital, and event variables and its effect on survival to discharge. Methods A retrospective, single institution registry included all admissions to the Medical Center of Central Georgia in which resuscitation was attempted between January 1987 and December 2000. The registry included 4692 admissions; only the first attempt was reported. Analyses of 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-hour intervals were performed; 1- and 4-hour intervals are presented. Results Significant circadian variation was found at 1 hour ( P = .01), but not at 4-hour intervals. Significant circadian variation was found for initial rhythms that were perfusing ( P = .03) and asystole ( P = .01). A significantly higher percentage of unwitnessed events were found as asystole during the overnight hours ( P = .002). Using simple logistic regression, time in 4-hour intervals and rhythm were each significantly related to patient survival until hospital discharge ( P = .003 and P <.0001). In multivariate analysis, only rhythm remained significant. Conclusions Circadian variation of cardiopulmonary arrest in this hospital has several temporal versions and is related to survival. Late night variation in witnessed events and rhythm suggests a delay between onset of clinical death and discovery, which contributes to poorer outcomes.

N2  - Social care detention, and its growing reach into the lives of older and disabled citizens and their caregivers, is one of the most striking socio-legal phenomena of the 21st century. Following the Supreme Court’s ruling in Cheshire West, the ambit of legal machinery designed to regulate institutional carceral care has broken free of its conceptual moorings and stands poised to regulate care arrangements far removed from formal ‘institutions’, producing paradoxical outcomes and practical dilemmas explored throughout this book. By naming this socio-legal phenomenon ‘social care detention’ I intend to distinguish it from other forms of detention more familiar to legal scholars, and identify some of its unique characteristics. I want to bring social care detention out of the shadows of its near neighbour, mental health detention, challenging often implicit assumptions within mental health law, policy, scholarship and activism that social care detention (or detention under the MCA) is a form of mental health detention ‘lite’, pointing toward ways that this sense has been historically produced.

N2  - Risk‐taking tendencies and environmental opportunities to commit crime are two key features in understanding criminal behavior. Upon release from prison, ex‐prisoners have a much greater opportunity to engage in risky activity and to commit criminal acts. We hypothesized that ex‐prisoners would exhibit greater risk‐taking tendencies compared to prisoners who have fewer opportunities to engage in risky activity and who are monitored constantly by prison authorities. Using cumulative prospect theory to compare the risky choices of prisoners and ex‐prisoners our study revealed that ex‐prisoners who were within 16 weeks of their prison release made riskier choices than prisoners. Our data indicate that previous studies comparing prisoners behind bars with nonoffenders may have underestimated the risk‐taking tendencies of offenders. The present findings emphasize the central role played by risk‐taking attitudes in criminal offending and highlight a need to examine offenders after release from prison.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Objective  To test the hypothesis that among hazardously drinking incarcerated women who are returning to the community, a brief alcohol intervention will result in less alcohol use at follow‐up relative to standard of care.
Methods  Eligible participants endorsed hazardous alcohol consumption—four or more drinks at a time on at least 3 separate days in the previous 3 months or a score of 8 or above on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Participants were randomized to either an assessment‐only condition or to two brief motivationally focused sessions, the first delivered during incarceration, the second 1 month later after community re‐entry. Participants recalled drinking behaviors at 3 and 6 months after the baseline interview using a 90‐day time‐line follow‐back method.
Results  The 245 female participants averaged 34 years of age, and were 71% Caucasian. The mean percentage of alcohol use days in the 3 months prior to incarceration was 51.7% and heavy alcohol use days was 43.9%. Intervention effects on abstinent days were statistically significant at 3 months (odds ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence interval 1.17, 3.30); the percentage of days abstinent was 68% for those randomized to intervention and 57% for controls. At 6 months the effect of the intervention was attenuated and no longer statistically significant.
Conclusions  Among incarcerated women who reported hazardous drinking, a two‐session brief alcohol intervention increased abstinent days at 3 months, but this effect decayed by 6 months. Study participants continued to drink heavily after return to the community. More intensive intervention pre‐release and after re‐entry may benefit hazardously drinking incarcerated women.

N2  - Objective: To examine the effect of incarceration within 12 months of initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on non-adherence and HIV-1 RNA suppression.
Methods: We compared the adherence and virological outcomes among participants in a population-based HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program in British Columbia, Canada, by history of incarceration in a provincial prison. Participants who were HIV-infected, naive to HAART and who were prescribed treatment between 1 July 1997 and 1 March 2002 were eligible for this study. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with non-adherence and Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to determine the factors associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression adjusting for age, gender, history of drug use, baseline HIV-1 RNA, baseline CD4 cell count, type of antiretroviral regimen [two nucleosides + protease inhibitor (PI) vs two nucleosides + non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)], physician's HIV-related experience for each subject and adherence as measured by pharmacy refill compliance.
Results: There were 1746 subjects (101 incarcerated/1645 non-incarcerated) who started antiretroviral therapy between 1 July 1997 and 1 March 2002. Of those incarcerated, 50 initiated HAART while in prison and 27 subjects were released but returned to prison in the follow-up period. Subjects received antiretroviral therapy while incarcerated for a median number of 4 months [interquartile range (IQR): 2-10]. Multiple logistic regression results showed that a history of incarceration within 12 months of initiating HAART independently increased the odds of non-adherence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.40; 95% confidence interval (95% Cl): 1.54-3.75]. A history of injected drug use was also associated with non-adherence (AOR: 1.49; 95% Cl: 1.17-1.90). The following factors were negatively associated with non-adherence: older age (AOR: 0.81; 95% Cl: 0.72-0.91), male sex (AOR: 0.50; 95% Cl: 0.38-0.65) and higher physician HIV-related experience (AOR: 0.97; 95% Cl: 0.96-0.98). In addition, a history of incarceration within 12 months of initiating HAART reduced the odds of achieving HIV-1 RNA suppression [adjusted hazards ratio (AHR) 0.68; 95% Cl: 0.51-0.89]. Other factors negatively associated with viral suppression included a history of drug injection (AHR: 0.79; 95% Cl: 0.69-0.91), two nucleosides + PI vs two nucleosides + NNRTI (AHR: 0.77; 95% Cl: 0.69-0.87), higher baseline HIV-1 RNA (AHR: 0.66; 95% Cl: 0.62-0.70). Higher adherence was positively associated with viral suppression (AHR: 1.38; 95% Cl: 1.34-1.42). Among the 101 subjects who were incarcerated in the first year of starting HAART, the time spent in jail was positively associated with HIV-1 RNA suppression (HR: 1.06; 95% Cl: 1.02-1.10).
Conclusion: HIV-infected subjects with a history of incarceration within 12 months of initiating HAART have higher odds of non-adherence and, consequently, lower probability of achieving HIV-1 RNA suppression. The longer their sentence, however, the higher the probability of virological suppression. The British Columbian provincial prison system provided a structured setting for HAART but subjects are unable to continue this level of adherence upon release. Strategies to ensure continuation of HIV/AIDS care for HIV-infected individuals leaving the criminal justice system must be a public health priority.

Method: All women and remanded male inmates in New Zealand prisons, and a randomly selected cohort of 18% of sentenced male inmates were interviewed. Interviewers used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview –Automated to establish DSM-IV diagnoses, and the Personality Disorders Questionnaire to identify personality disorder. All prisons in New Zealand were visited.
Results: The results indicate markedly elevated prevalence rates for major mental disorder in the prison population when compared with community samples. This is especially the case for substance misuse, psychotic disorders, major depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Of particular concern is not only the increased prevalence rates for schizophrenia and related disorders but also the high level of comorbidity with substance misuse disorders demonstrated by this group. While 80.8% of inmates diagnosed with bipolar disorder were receiving psychiatric treatment in the prison, only 46.4% of depressed inmates and 37% of those suffering from psychosis were receiving treatment. Maori inmates were grossly overrepresented in the remand, female and male sentenced inmate population compared with the general population.
Conclusions: A significant increase in provision of mental health services is required to cope with the high number of mentally ill inmates. The level of need demonstrated by this study requires a level of service provision that is quite beyond the capacity of current forensic psychiatry services, Department of Corrections Psychological Services or the prison nursing and medical officers. The elevated rates of common mental disorders argues for the use of improved psychiatric screening instruments, improved assessment and treatment capacities in the prison and an increased number of forensic psychiatric inpatient facilities to care for those psychotic inmates who are too unwell to be treated in the prison.

N2  - Most US jails and prisons do not provide condoms to prisoners because of concerns about possible negative consequences. Since 1989, the jail system of San Francisco, California, has provided condoms to male prisoners through 1-on-1 counseling sessions. Given the limitations of this approach, we installed, stocked, and monitored a free condom-dispensing machine in a jail to examine the feasibility of this method of providing condoms to jail prisoners. After the machine was installed, we observed increases in prisoners' awareness of programmatic access to condoms and in their likelihood of having obtained condoms. Particularly large increases in condom uptake were reported among those in high-risk groups. Sexual activity did not increase, custody operations were not impeded, and staff acceptance of condom access for prisoners increased.

N2  - This study investigated the effects of hope, social support, and stress on behavioral problems in a high-risk group of 65 children of incarcerated mothers. Children with low levels of hope had more externalizing and internalizing problems. Children who perceived less social support had more externalizing problems, and children who had experienced more life stressors reported more internalizing problems. Regression analyses indicated that hope contributed unique variance to both internalizing and externalizing behavioral problems after social support and stress were controlled. These findings suggest that being confident in one's ability to overcome challenges and having a positive outlook function as protective factors, whereas being less hopeful may place a child at risk for developing adjustment problems. Whether it is possible to foster agency and teach pathways to children with lower levels of hope is discussed.

N2  - Objectives. People who are incarcerated exhibit high rates of disease, but data evaluating the delivery of medical services to inmates are sparse, particularly for jail settings. We sought to characterize the primary medical care providers for county jail inmates in New York State.
Methods. From 2007 through 2009, we collected data on types of medical care providers for jail inmates in all New York State counties. We obtained data from state monitoring programs and e-mail questionnaires sent to county departments of health.
Results. In counties outside New York City (n = 57), jail medical care was delivered by local providers in 40 counties (70%), correctional medical corporations in 8 counties (14%), and public providers in 9 counties (16%). In New York City, 90% of inmates received medical care from a correctional medical corporation. Larger, urban jails, with a greater proportion of Black and Hispanic inmates, tended to use public hospitals or correctional medical corporations as health care vendors.
Conclusions. Jail medical services in New York State were heterogeneous and decentralized, provided mostly by local physician practices and correctional medical corporations. There was limited state oversight and coordination of county jail medical care.

N2  - Although prisons have been noted as important venues for HIV testing, few studies have explored the factors within this context that may influence HIV test acceptance. Moreover, there is a dearth of research related to HIV and incarcerated populations in middle and low-income countries, where both the burden of HIV and the number of people incarcerated is higher compared to high-income countries. This study explores the relationship between HIV coping self-efficacy, HIV-related stigma, and HIV test acceptance in the largest prisons in Jamaica. A random sample of inmates (n=298) recruited from an HIV testing demonstration project were asked to complete a cross-sectional quantitative survey. Participants who reported high HIV coping self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.86: 95% confidence interval CI 1.24-2.78, p-value=0.003), some perceived risk of HIV (AOR 2.51: 95% (CI) 1.57-4.01, p-value=0.000), and low HIV testing stigma (AOR 1.71: 95% CI 1.05-2.79, p-value=0.032) were more likely to test for HIV. Correlates of HIV coping self-efficacy included external and internal HIV stigma (AOR 1.28: 95% CI 1.25-1.32, p-value=0.000 and AOR 1.76: 95% CI 1.34-2.30, p-value=0.000, respectively), social support (AOR 2.09: 95% CI 1.19-3.68, p-value=0.010), and HIV knowledge (AOR 2.33: 95% CI 1.04-5.22, p-value=0.040). Policy and programs should focus on the interrelationships of these constructs to increase participation in HIV testing in prison.

N2  - While people may no longer be living in the Jim Crow era per se, many of the technologies and ideologies of that time have been so normalized and internalized that they may hardly be aware of the extent to which discipline, punishment, and intimacy continue to go hand in hand. Those who labor also, as Biff reminds them, love. As Jose Munoz suggests in Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, Queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present. The here and now is a prison house. A queer critique of the carceral network must not turn away or be afraid of suspension between radiance and darkness. Instead, coalitional identification with the queer gal-boys and their lovers, with injured prisoners and disabled neighbors, with striking workers and racialized others, is a necessary step toward imagining a future beyond the prison house.

N2  - Social care detention is anchored in the right to liberty. Although, as I argued in Chapter 3, this has deep roots and antecedents in the carceral era, 21st-century social care detention is a global phenomenon, with close links to international human rights law. Indeed, it is plausible that without international human rights instruments, particularly the ECHR, Anglo-Welsh domestic legal frameworks regulating social care detention (the MCA DoLS/LPS) would not exist. The problems sheltering under the umbrella of social care detention might be understood as different kinds of legal problem, or perhaps not as legal problems at all. This chapter provides an overview of the international human rights settlement, from its development shortly after the Second World War through to the present day, with a view to understanding its pivotal role in developing and cross-fertilizing the concept of social care detention.

N2  - Aberrant expression and/or activity of the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase SFK (Src family kinase) members are commonly observed in progressive stages of human tumours. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Src is a potential drug target for treating oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Compared with the human immortalized oesophageal epithelial cell line SHEE, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells have increased tyrosine phosphorylation activities. We have explored the therapeutic potential of dasatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We examined that the effects of dasatinib on proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, spindle checkpoint, cell-cycle arrest and kinase activity in vitro using three human oesophageal carcinoma cell lines KYSE30, KYSE180 and EC109. In nude mouse models, dasatinib treatment effectively inhibited the expression of activated Src, resulting in the inhibition of tumour growth. Multiple drug effect isobologram analysis was used to study interactions with the chemotherapeutic drug docetaxel. As expected, the three oesophageal carcinoma cell lines were highly sensitive to dasatinib, but SHEE cells were not sensitive to this drug. Concentration-dependent anti-proliferative effects of dasatinib were observed in the three oesophageal carcinoma cell lines. Dasatinib significantly inhibited oesophageal carcinoma cell invasion and up-regulation of MAD2 (mitotic arrest-deficient 2), as well as inducing cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Additive and synergistic interactions were observed for the combination of dasatinib and docetaxel. Therefore it was concluded that dasatinib blocks the G1/S transition and inhibits cell growth. These results provided a clear biological rationale to test dasatinib as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, we have shown in vitro and in vivo that dasatinib might have therapeutic benefit for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who are not eligible for surgery.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine differences between men and women entering prison-based therapeutic community (TC) treatment and to explore the relationship of those differences to posttreatment outcomes (i.e., aftercare participation and reincarceration rates). Extensive treatment-intake interview data for 4,386 women and 4,164 men from 16 prison-based TCs in California were compared using chi-square analyses and t-tests. Logistic regression analyses were then conducted separately for men and women to identify gender-specific factors associated with post-treatment outcomes. Prison intake data and treatment participation data come from a 5-year process and outcome evaluation of the California Department of Corrections' (CDC) Prison Treatment Expansion Initiative. The return-to-custody data came from the CDC's Offender Based Information System. Bivariate results showed that women were at a substantial disadvantage compared with their male counterparts with regard to histories of employment, substance abuse, psychological functioning, and sexual and physical abuse prior to incarceration. In contrast, men had more serious criminal justice involvement than women prior to incarceration. After controlling for these and other factors related to outcomes, regression findings showed that there were both similarities and differences with regard to gender-specific predictors of posttreatment outcomes. Time in treatment and motivation for treatment were similar predictors of aftercare participation for men and women. Psychological impairment was the strongest predictor of recidivism for both men and women. Substantial differences in background characteristics and the limited number of predictors related to posttreatment outcomes for women suggests the plausibility of gender-specific paths in the recovery process.

N2  - Background: Comorbid substance use disorder(s) and post-traumatic stress disorder (SUD-PTSD) is common among prisoners and linked to an increased risk of criminal recidivism; however, little is known about the characteristics of prisoners with this comorbidity. Aim: This study provides a preliminary examination of the clinical and criminal profile of male inmates with symptoms of SUD-PTSD, and examines whether this profile differs according to whether a person has experienced a trauma while in prison. Methods: Thirty male inmates from two correctional centres in Sydney, Australia, were recruited and assessed using a structured interview. Results: The sample reported extensive criminal, substance use and trauma histories. A history of substance dependence was almost universal (90%) and 56.7% met diagnostic criteria for PTSD with the remainder experiencing sub-threshold symptoms. Forty-three per cent reported a traumatic event while in prison. Those who had experienced trauma in prison, compared to those who had not, were more likely to nominate heroin as their main drug of concern and to be receiving drug treatment in prison. There was also a trend toward inmates who had experienced a trauma in prison being more likely than inmates who had no prison trauma to have experienced a physical assault. Conclusion: Male prisoners with SUD-PTSD are a high-needs group yet treatment responses are poor. Further research examining treatment options for this comorbidity may improve prisoner well-being and reduce recidivism.

N2  - AimsPrisoners include a disproportionate number of those with social and clinical risk factors for tuberculosis and pose a challenge for control. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of prisoners with tuberculosis in order to inform clinical management and control policy.MethodsBetween 2004 and 2007, 205 patients newly diagnosed as having tuberculosis in prison in the UK identified in national surveillance reports were studied. Isolates from prisoners were tested for susceptibility to first-line antituberculosis drugs and strain typed where possible.ResultsPrisoners were significantly more likely to be UK-born (47 vs 25%), to be white (33 vs 22%) and to have pulmonary disease (75 vs 56%) than other tuberculosis patients. Pulmonary cases were also more likely to be sputum-smear-positive (69 vs 57%). Over one-third of culture confirmed cases among prisoners were resistant to isoniazid. Less than half (48%) of patients diagnosed as having tuberculosis in prison completed treatment, with a fifth lost to follow-up.DiscussionIn the UK, imprisonment is an important risk factor for tuberculosis, especially drug-resistant and infectious forms of the disease. The management of tuberculosis among UK prisoners is further complicated by high rates of loss to follow-up care and poor treatment outcomes.

N2  - Aggression in youth prison is considered a major problem, probably interfering with treatment and rehabilitative goals, and creating an unsafe work environment for group workers. The present study examined how inmates' personality (dispositional characteristics) and living group climate (situational characteristics) contribute to aggression in a sample of 59 incarcerated delinquent boys. The results showed that open group climate was positively associated with agreeableness and openness and buffered against aggression through its positive effect on neuroticism. A repressive group climate was negatively associated with low neuroticism and proved to be unrelated to aggression. The discussion focuses on the importance of a positive living group climate for efficacious treatment and rehabilitation of incarcerated delinquent boys.

N2  - Prisons and prison inmates present important targets for HIV/AIDS prevention interventions. Inmates often have histories of high-risk behavior that place them in danger of contracting HIV/AIDS, and rates of HIV/AIDS tend to be much higher in this population. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a prison-based HIV/AIDS intervention to change attitudes toward HIV prevention, norms supporting HIV prevention, perceived behavioral control (i.e., self-efficacy) for HIV prevention behaviors, and intentions to engage in HIV prevention behaviors postrelease. The intervention also had the goal of encouraging inmates to become HIV/AIDS peer educators. The intervention appeared most successful at influencing beliefs and behaviors related to peer education and somewhat successful at influencing beliefs and intentions related to condom use. Analyses also showed some significant differences in effectiveness by race/ethnicity. Results are discussed from the perspectives of both research and practice with regard to prison-based HIV prevention efforts.

During the month preceding reincarceration, HIV transmission risk behaviors were common among respondents, and 59% of those with a history of antiretroviral use were not taking HAART. HAART discontinuation was independently associated with homelessness, marijuana use, injection drug use, and not receiving community medical care. Postrelease interventions for inmates who are HIV infected are needed.

N2  - Psychiatric disorders are highly prevalent among incarcerated youth. However, whereas ethnic minority youths are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system, limited research is available on their mental health. In this study, differences in mental health problems between incarcerated adolescents of native Dutch and Moroccan origin, were examined. Child Behavior Checklist and Youth Self-Report scores were compared between incarcerated adolescents of native Dutch and Moroccan origin. Their scores were also compared to those of native Dutch and Moroccan immigrant youths in the general, non-incarcerated population. Native Dutch incarcerated adolescents showed higher levels of various mental health problems than incarcerated adolescents with a Moroccan background. Compared to the general population, incarcerated youths showed higher levels of mental health problems, but this deviation was much larger for native Dutch than for Moroccan immigrant youths. These ethnic differences in mental health problems could not be explained by ethnic differences in socio-economic background and social desirable answering tendencies. Incarcerated youths of Moroccan origin show less psychopathology than incarcerated native Dutch youths, which might be explained by disparities in sentencing procedures.

N2  - Summary Objectives To determine entry antibody seroprevalence and seroconversion to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and associated risk factors in newly incarcerated prisoners. Methods Males and females entering South Australian prisons completed risk factor surveys and were offered HCV-antibody testing. Participants completed additional surveys and, if HCV-negative at last test, underwent further antibody tests at 3-monthly intervals for up to 15 months. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Results HCV seroprevalence among 662 prison entrants was estimated at 42%. Previous injecting history was highly prevalent at entry (64%) and both community and prison injecting independently predicted entry HCV status. Tattooing was not an important risk factor. While community exposure could not be ruled out, three seroconversions were noted in 148 initially HCV-seronegative individuals occurring in a median 121 days – 4.6 per 100 person-years. Prison injecting was infrequently reported, but HCV-seropositive participants were significantly more likely to commence IDU in prison than seronegative participants ( p = 0.035). Conclusions Entry HCV seroprevalence in South Australian prisoners is extremely high and may have contributed to a ‘ceiling effect’, minimizing the observable seroconversion rate. Greater frequency of injecting among those already infected with HCV represents a significant threat to other prisoners and prison staff.

N2  - We examined the role of psychopathic traits on physiological responding during a concealed information polygraph test among prison inmates (n=40). The Psychopathic Personality Inventory (Lilienfeld & Andrews, 1996) was used to assess psychopathic traits. Cardiac, electrodermal, and respiratory responses were measured while participants were presented with personal and control names and asked to conceal recognition of personal information. We first piloted the present concealed information test in a sample of undergraduates (n=27). Enhanced orienting to concealed information compared to control information was observed in both prisoners and undergraduates. However, prisoners scoring high on the Impulsive Antisociality factor of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI‐II) exhibited reduced electrodermal responding. This finding indicates that the sensitivity of the concealed information test may be decreased in antisocial offenders.

N2  - Electronic monitoring, (EM), or 'tagging', is a relatively recent but increasingly used sentencing measure employed by criminal justice agencies across the globe. Dispensed for a range of criminal offences, it typically functions by enabling the construction of a curfew intended to keep users in a designated place for a period of time. Despite its widespread usage, tagging is an under researched and controversial penal sanction beset with numerous difficulties that has garnered as much criticism as praise. The emergence of EM accompanies concerns about increasing uses of surveillance and control within society, yet has been often faulted for failing to practically function. As new technologies transform the criminal justice landscape, recent theoretical perspectives have attempted to theorise measures like EM within criminology. Foremost amongst these positions, actor network theory (or ANT), is a constructivist approach that advocates using observational methods, which, besides challenging many long standing social scientific ideas, controversially contends that material objects have agency and lead 'fluid lives'. Asserting further that objects are entangled with humans in 'assemblages of actors', the position attempts to demonstrate how dynamic interactions within these 'heterogeneous networks' lead to successful social ordering. Importantly, it urges researchers to 'describe' these 'hybridised socio-technical systems' while making as few presumptions as possible; to outline how (or if) they accomplish this. This PhD thesis undertakes an ethnographic investigation of tagging from the position of offenders subject to a range of EM sentences in a location in England dubbed 'EM City', and uses a modified version of ANT alongside allied approaches such as postphenomenology. It borrows the administrative criminological concepts of 'compliance' and 'desistance', to serve as metrics for assessing how tagging leads outcomes of programme completion and criminal de-escalation to sometimes emerge. Additionally, it attempts to understand how variable 'affects' (or 'pains') associated with its restrictions arise from a somewhat more critical criminological position; however, these are expanded to account for positive, or neutral/ambivalent reactions. The experiences of 'supporting actors' who assist EM users are also investigated, before finally re-joining a selection of users post-sentence. It is demonstrated that tagging often becomes an onerous penalty that is sometimes implicated in attaining desired outcomes, but that it also routinely features prohibited activity: led by a range of factors within the 'chaos' of many offenders' lives. The device-system of EM is further asserted to form a 'carceral actant-ensemble', which, when 'bound' to it, leads 'hybrid-users' (or 'hosts') to acquire their range of experiences. Ultimately, however, whether tagging derives punitive affects or achieves success in maintaining curfews and reducing offending, is dependent on its enrolment of pre-existing, yet shifting, wider associations within the lives of users. This temporary 'penal assemblage' is, additionally, shown to be intersected further by several socio-technical issues: offender support, poverty, ethnicity, and gender, which become enrolled through it.

N2  - A review of 19 studies suggests that it may be feasible to identify prisoners with suicide risk on the basis of demographic, psychiatric, and criminal characteristics. The present study aimed to identify combinations of characteristics that are capable of identifying potential suicide victims. Characteristics of 95 suicide victims in the Dutch prison system were compared with those of a random sample of 247 inmates in ten jails. Combinations of indicators for suicide risk were also tested for their capability of identifying 209 suicides in U.S. jails and 279 prison suicides in England and Wales. A combination of six characteristics (age 40+, homelessness, history of psychiatric care, history of drug abuse, one prior incarceration, violent offence) was capable of correctly classifying 82% of the Dutch suicide victims (82% specificity). Less powerful combinations correctly classified 53% of the U.S. suicides and 47% of the U.K. suicides. It is concluded that a set of demographic and criminal characteristics and indicators of psychiatric problems is useful for the identification of suicide risk in jails and prisons.

N2  - In the past few decades, US policies have led to an unprecedented increase in the number of people behind bars. While more men than women are incarcerated, the rate of increase for women has been higher.
Evidence of the negative impact of incarceration on the health of women of color suggests strategies to reduce these adverse effects. Correctional policies contribute to disparities in health between White women and women of color, providing a public health rationale for policy change.
Specific roles for health professionals include becoming involved in alliances addressing alternatives to incarceration, creating programs that address the needs of women in correctional facilities, and identifying the pathways by which correctional policies damage health.

N2  - Background: Approximately 1 in 4 of the nearly 2 million individuals in state and federal correctional facilities are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Currently, there are few reports of treatment outcomes of this common infection in this setting.
Objective: To describe HCV therapy in the incarcerated setting.
Design: Retrospective, descriptive observational study.
Setting: Rhode Island Department of Corrections, Cranston, Rhode island.
Patients: 93 inmates with chronic HCV infection.
Intervention: Interferon-alpha with ribavirin.
Measurements: HCV RNA levels 6 months after treatment.
Results: Response rates are similar to previously published rates achieved in the community; 63% (50 of 79) of patients achieved viral clearance after 6 months of therapy, and 46% (26 of 57) achieved sustained response 6 months after treatment.
Conclusion: The incarcerated population (which is disproportionately affected by addiction and psychiatric illness) can be effectively treated for HCV infection with interferon and ribavirin. The correctional setting may provide an opportunity to safely treat patients with these two challenging comorbid conditions.

N2  - The recognition that good prison health is important to general public health has led 28 countries in the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) to join a WHO network dedicated to improving health within prisons. Within the 10 years since that time, vital actions have been taken and important policy documents have been produced. A key factor in making progress is breaking down the isolation of prison health services and bringing them into closer collaboration with the country’s public health services.
However, barriers to progress remain. A continuing challenge is how best to move from policy recommendations to implementation, so that the network’s fundamental aim of noticeable improvements in the health and care of prisoners is further achieved.

N2  - Building on the literature that traces the evolution of carceral feminism back to second wave feminist calls for victims' rights, legal protections, and the professionalization of the anti-violence movement, this chapter unpacks the emotions underlying feminist calls for punitive and carceral state responses to violence and sexual violence against women, which we situate as an outcome of centuries of denial and lack of acknowledgement. We then discuss the legacy of Carol Smart, a foremother of critical feminist criminology. Smart's work is foundational to the discipline, but seems to have been forgotten amongst those working in critical prison studies and doing anti-carceral work. Over 30 years ago, Smart not only pronounced law as a gendering practice, but she also warned against looking to or relying on law to support and/or produce feminist outcomes. Specifically, she argued that this could lead to juridogenesis-an iatrogenic-like effect of using law that can lead to the growth in technologies of knowledge production that facilitate disciplinary mechanisms and disregard and/or disqualify alternative discourses or systems of knowledge. We conclude by outlining feminist ways forward in the penal abolition movement that stand outside law's power and instead look to community alternatives to incarceration.

N2  - Objectives. We assessed how different patterns of housing instability affect incarceration and whether correlates of incarceration are gender specific.
Methods. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess associations between patterns of housing instability and recent jail stays among a reproducible sample of 1175 marginally housed adults in San Francisco, California.
Results. Over the previous year, 71% of men and 21% of women in the sample reported jail stays. Among women, long-term single-room occupancy hotel stays ( > 90 days) were protective for incarceration. Stays in the street were associated with incarceration among both genders, but among men, short-term (i.e., ≤ 90 days) street stays were associated with the highest odds of incarceration, and among women, long-term street stays were most correlated with incarceration. Sex trade increased the odds of incarceration among men only; recent drug use was associated with incarceration among both genders.
Conclusions. Correlates of incarceration differed by gender, and patterns of housing instability differentially affected incarceration for men and women. Policies to improve housing options and drug treatment for the urban poor are critical to breaking the cycle of incarceration and homelessness and improving health outcomes.

N2  - While access champions are racing to put out fires set by radical legislators in the public sphere, materials bans have been smoldering in state and federal prisons for decades with little to no recourse for those adversely affected. Just as lawmakers attempt to control minors by banning what they do not wish them to know, state and federal carceral systems prioritize power and control over rehabilitation. [...]banned materials include all issues of Don Diva, Ghost in the Shell, Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee Directory and Reference Guide, San Francisco Bay View (a national Black newspaper), Small Business Taxes for Dummies, issues of Popular Science and Popular Mechanics, Art and Queer Culture, The 48 Laws of Power, and a book with the nondescriptive name Hurricanes. In 1974, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote in Procunier v.

N2  - Background: A large epidemic of HIV-1 subtype B began among injection drug users (IDUs) in Bangkok in 1988. Despite ongoing prevention efforts, HIV-1 prevalence among IDUs remained at 30-50% through the 1990s.
Objectives: To measure the incidence of HIV-1 infection and related risk factors to guide prevention efforts and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting an HIV vaccine efficacy trial.
Design and methods: A prospective cohort study in which IDUs attending methadone treatment programs in Bangkok were screened during 1995-1996 for enrollment into the study. IDUs found to be HIV-seronegative on two occasions were offered enrollment with follow-up visits every 4 months. On each visit participants were evaluated with a questionnaire and serologic testing.
Results: A total of 1209 HIV-negative IDUs were enrolled. Through the end of 1998, the overall HIV-1 incidence rate was 5.8 (95% confidence interval, 4.8-6.8) per 100 person-years of follow-up. HIV-1 subtypes E and B accounted for 79 and 21% of infections, respectively. On multivariate analysis, HIV-1 seroconversion was primarily associated with the frequency of heroin injection, the sharing of injection equipment, and incarceration, especially with drug injection. Sexual behavior was not associated with increased risk for HIV-1. Risk factors for infection with HIV-I subtypes E and B were similar.
Conclusion: HIV-1 transmission risk remains high among Bangkok IDUs despite methadone treatment and other current prevention strategies. There is an urgent need to address this ongoing epidemic, especially in jails and prisons. This study led to the initiation in 1999 of a phase ill HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trial in this population.

N2  - This thesis presents a critical exploration of the impact of neoliberal discourses and policies upon the organisation and experience of theatre practice within prisons in England and Wales. It was undertaken in order to bridge the gap between sociological knowledge around the impacts of neoliberalism and performance literature on the value and purpose of prison theatre and to situate prison theatre within the current socio-political context. This study aimed to develop an understanding of the influence of neoliberalism upon experiences of developing, delivering, and participating in theatre practice in prisons and to identify the ways in which neoliberal discourses and policy have informed prisoners' and practitioners' understandings, practices, and performances of care. A narrative approach was used to develop an understanding of the shifting landscape of theatre practice in prisons and the ways in which participants' sense-making practices around this. Narrative interviews were undertaken with six prison theatre company directors, five freelance prison theatre facilitators and seven former prisoners, and a narrative analysis was used alongside artistic inquiry to understand their stories. The study uncovered a sense of precarity and unpredictability within prison which can be understood as a 'carceral volatility' that both produces and is produced by relational precarity. The mechanisms by which neoliberal governmentality permeates and shapes every aspect of prison theatre, most notably the cultivation of a relational precarity and the co-option of prison theatre into a tool to perform a spectacle which reproduces dominant social narratives are presented in this thesis, alongside key methods found of resisting these impacts such as cultivating connection and considering aesthetics. This thesis also offers a methodological contribution through the presentation of poetry to offer affective senses of both prison, and prison theatre.

N2  - Aims: Previous prison studies show that female prisoners often have more health problems than male prisoners do and that they have many chronic health conditions. Few studies have been made among offenders concerning the use of health services, and even fewer concerning physical diseases. We studied the self-reported lifetime somatic diseases, the use of health services and the current use of prescription medicines among Finnish female prisoners and compared them with males. Methods: The sample consisted of 101 females and 309 male prisoners as controls.The study included several questionnaires and interviews conducted by experienced prison nurses. Results: The women had more commonly genitourinary, virus hepatitis/HIV infections and group "other diseases" than the men. Over 80% of the women and men have had accidents/injuries. Four out of five women, and half of the men, used some medicine regularly. Of the females, 92% (80% of the males) reported lifetime hospital care and 65% (61%) treatment in surgery department, respectively; 70% of the females (53% of the males) reported lifetime use of any psychiatric service; 66% of the women (46% of the men) had received psychiatric outpatient services, and 43% (31%) psychiatric in-patient hospital care and 38% (30%) substance abuse services, respectively. Conclusions: The heavy use of health services among female prisoners resulted mainly from the use of services for substance use and other mental disorders and treatment in surgery department. Compared to men, the difference in using health services was associated with psychiatric services.

N2  - Data derived from the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails and the 2000 National Survey of Veterans show that having mental health problems in addition to such sociodemographic characteristics as being a member of a minority group, not being married, having less education, and being younger are risk factors for incarceration among veterans, as they are for the general population. As in previous studies veterans who served during the Vietnam Era and to an even greater extent, those who served in the early years of the All Volunteer Force were at greater risk of incarceration than veterans from the most recent period of the AVF, after controlling for age and other factors.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To investigate pre‐custody levels of drug use among newly sentenced prisoners and factors associated with perceived drug treatment need.
Design, setting and participants  A sample of 1457 prisoners was recruited to a general purpose longitudinal survey of convicted prisoners starting a new sentence.
Measurements  Data were collected by structured interviews on reception to prison. Measures were taken of illicit drug use, drug treatment history, current treatment needs, psychological health and a range of social problems.
Findings  Life‐time use of heroin, crack cocaine, cocaine powder, amphetamines or cannabis was reported by 79% of prisoners. Cannabis was the drug reported most commonly, but approximately a third had used heroin or crack cocaine during the year before custody. Nearly half of recent drug users reported wanting help or support with a drug problem during their sentence. Dependence on heroin and cocaine, previous drug treatment, employment, accommodation and psychological health problems were all associated positively with perceived treatment need.
Conclusions  The prevalence of pre‐custody drug use among this sample of newly sentenced prisoners was high. Because treatment need was associated with a range of drug, health and social factors, assessment and referral to appropriate interventions should occur as soon as possible on reception. Treatment should be coordinated with other services and support.

N2  - Background. Non-heart-beating donors are expected to ameliorate shortages of donors for organ transplantation. The issue of preventing warm ischemic injury after circulatory arrest must be investigated. In the current study, we investigated whether isoflurane inhalation during warm ischemia could attenuate ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) of the lung.
Methods. An isolated perfused rat lung model was used. The rats were allocated into four groups: the no ischemia group; the ischemia-1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) iso group (ventilation with air and 1.38% isoflurane); the Ischemia-3MAC iso group (ventilation with air and 4.2% isoflurane); and the Ischemia-no treatment group (ventilation with only air). Lungs were subjected to 50 min of ischemia at 37 degrees C. Physiological lung functions were measured after reperfusion in experiment one. Mitochondrial control ratio (RCR), cytochrome-c release from mitochondria, and caspase activities just after warm ischemia were measured in experiment two.
Results. Pulmonary functions in the Ischemia-1MAC iso group were significantly greater than those in the Ischemia-no treatment group for experiment one. There were no dose-dependent effects between 1MAC and 3MAC isoflurane. In experiment two, RCR in the Ischemia-1MAC iso group was significantly greater than that in the Ischemia-no treatment group. Cytochrome-c release and caspase-9 activity in the Ischemia-1MAC iso group were significantly decreased compared to those in the Ischemia-no treatment group.
Conclusions. Isoflurane inhalation attenuates warm IRI with the protection of mitochondria. Our results suggest that isoflurane inhalation after circulatory arrest can be a simple and effective method to protect the lung against warm ischemia.

N2  - Objectives. We examined correlates of incarceration among young methamphetamine users in Chiang Mai, Thailand in 2005 to 2006.
Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1189 young methamphetamine users. Participants were surveyed about their recent drug use, sexual behaviors, and incarceration. Biological samples were obtained to test for sexually transmitted and viral infections.
Results. Twenty-two percent of participants reported ever having been incarcerated. In multivariate analysis, risk behaviors including frequent public drunkenness, starting to use illicit drugs at an early age, involvement in the drug economy, tattooing, injecting drugs, and unprotected sex were correlated with a history of incarceration. HIV, HCV, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection were also correlated with incarceration.
Conclusions. Incarcerated methamphetamine users are engaging in behaviors and being exposed to environments that put them at increased risk of infection and harmful practices. Alternatives to incarceration need to be explored for youths.

N2  - drennan v., goodman c., norton c. & wells a. (2010) Incontinence in women prisoners: an exploration of the issues. Journal of Advanced Nursing 66(9), 1953–1967.
Aim.  This paper is a report of a study exploring the extent and management of bladder and bowel problems in order to inform the provision and practice of prison nursing services and health care services in women’s prisons.
Background.  Nurses and general practitioners provide primary care services inside prisons in the United Kingdom. While high levels of mental health and addiction problems in women prisoners are recognized, there has been less focus on physical problems. Incontinence symptoms are perceived as shameful and stigmatizing, and frequently help is not sought from healthcare professionals. Guidance for assessing prisoner health does not refer to bladder and bowel symptoms.
Methods.  Women prisoners in a large, closed prison in the United Kingdom were surveyed in 2005 using an anonymous self‐completed questionnaire. Women resident in the detoxification unit and the hospital unit, absent from their unit at the time of questionnaire distribution or deemed vulnerable by prison health staff were excluded.
Results.  Questionnaires were offered to 283 women and 246 agreed to take it. Of those taken, 148 (60%) were returned. Twenty‐four per cent indicated that they disclosed information about bladder and bowel problems in the survey not previously disclosed to anyone else. Forty‐three per cent reported urinary symptoms. Five per cent reported nocturnal enuresis. The majority of women with symptoms reported using sanitary pads and toilet paper for containment of leakage.
Conclusion.  Prison nurses and nurse practitioners involved in reception into prison assessments should ask direct but sensitive questions about women’s bladder and bowel symptoms.

N2  - Purpose: There is a lack of good-quality outcome evaluations of interventions for offenders whose crimes are alcohol-related. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered gold standard in treatment evaluations. Here, we report on a feasibility study for an RCT of an alcohol-related violence intervention, Control of Violence for Angry, Impulsive Drinkers (COVAID). Method: 115 adult male prisoners were randomly allocated to COVAID plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU only. Results: Most participants (84%) found COVAID useful. Reconviction data at six months were accessed for 109 (95%) participants. There were no differences between the two groups on violent reconvictions or all reconvictions at the six-month period, but at 17 months the COVAID group had 13% fewer people reconvicted for violence, and 20% fewer had reconvictions for any offence. Conclusion: The results indicate that an RCT is feasible and provides parameters for designing a full RCT. Differences in reconviction between groups favoured COVAID and were clinically important.

N2  - Objectives. We examined the impact of smoking cessation on weight change in a population of women prisoners.
Methods. Women prisoners (n = 360) enrolled in a smoking cessation intervention; 250 received a 10-week group intervention plus transdermal nicotine replacement.
Results. Women who quit smoking had significant weight gain at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with a net difference of 10 pounds between smokers and abstainers at 6 months. By the 12-month follow-up, weight gain decreased among abstainers.
Conclusions. We are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate weight gain associated with smoking cessation among women prisoners. Smoking cessation interventions that address postcessation weight gain as a preventative measure may be beneficial in improving health and reducing the high prevalence of smoking in prisoner populations.

N2  - We wished to examine determinants of suicidal behavior in prisoners. 903 male prisoners had a psychiatric interview which included various psychometric tests. Suicide attempters were compared with prisoners who had never attempted suicide. Significantly more of the attempters had a history of psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, a family history of suicidal behavior, convictions for violent crime, had exhibited aggressive behavior in jail, and had higher BGLHA aggression scores. A similar pattern of risk factors was found for prisoners with suicidal ideation. A lifetime history of attempting suicide, or of having suicidal ideation, is frequent in prisoners. Risk factors include family, developmental, aggression, personality, psychiatric, and substance abuse factors.

N2  - Despite evidence supporting a connection between child maltreatment and self‐injury, there is disagreement regarding a particular connection to sexual abuse because types of trauma exposure often co‐occur. To examine these associations efficiently, we considered a sample of incarcerated juvenile females, where rates of both trauma exposure and self‐injury would be expected to be elevated. Adolescent females (N = 220) reported on history of self‐injurious behavior on the Voiced Index of Self‐injurious Actions, as well as psychiatric disorder. A common set of features was associated with cutting and with self‐injury in general. Both were more likely in those initiating delinquent activities when younger and in those currently meeting criteria for major depressive disorder, or with a previous suicide attempt. Adjusting for those features, report of self‐injury was approximately doubled among those disclosing prior traumatic exposure that was sexual, OR = 2.66, 95% CI [1.38, 5.15], or nonsexual, OR = 2.18, 95% CI [1.17, 4.04]. Exposure to early traumatic events, such as child maltreatment, likely contributes to a set of adverse experiences, including delinquent activity, mood disorder, and self‐injury. Findings contribute to work demonstrating the importance of dissociation both as a consequence of victimization and as a key feature underlying self‐injurious behavior.

N2  - The present study constructed empirically derived subtypes of adolescent offenders based on general traits and examined their associations with psychopathology and psychopathic traits. The sample included 342 detained minors (172 boys and 170 girls; mean age 15.85 years, SD = 1.07) recruited in various Youth Detention Centers across the Flemish part of Belgium. All adolescents provided self-reports on the quick big five, the youth self report, and the youth psychopathic traits inventory to assess general traits, psychopathology, and psychopathic traits respectively. Latent class analyses based on general personality traits were performed and suggested three personality types, consisting of an

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To evaluate the effects of a jail‐based continuation of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) on subsequent inmate recidivism risks.
Design  Prospective, longitudinal, observational study.
Setting  A large, Southwestern United States jail that continues MMT for heroin‐addicted inmates on MMT at the time of booking.
Participants  A total of 589 inmates booked between 22 November 2005 (the start date for the MMT program) and 31 October 2006.
Measurements  The outcome measure was time from release to subsequent re‐booking in the jail. Predictors included binary dosing with methadone in the jail, final dose received (mg), age, gender, race/ethnicity, previous bookings and days in jail.
Findings and conclusions  Random effects Weibull proportional hazards models were fit to the recidivism times to estimate the impact of treatment with MMT in the jail on re‐booking risks. There was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks (hazard ratio = 1.16; 95% confidence interval = 0.8–1.68). Offering jail‐based MMT does not increase recidivism risks by eliminating the deterrent effect of imposed withdrawal, nor does it reduce recidivism in this high‐risk population.

N2  - This paper focuses on patients'/prisoners' narratives that discuss the National Health Service mental healthcare provided in one Her Majesty's Prison Service establishment. In comparison to the general population, the prevalence of mental illness experienced by the prisoner population is exceedingly high. The prison environment is not conducive to mental health and this custodial clinical setting is not a useful catalyst for mental healthcare for myriad reasons. The pursuit of good mental health for patients in the penal milieu is challenging. For this medical sociology case study, qualitative semi-structured interviews are conducted with male prisoners in a Category B establishment. These participants are also primary or secondary level mental health service users. Analytical discussions concern the clinician-patient relationship and patients' opinions regarding the mental healthcare received. Debated concepts include: understanding, care, trust, flexibility, cooperation, conversation, relaxation, enjoyment and patient power. Mental healthcare receipt experiences and environments are important.

N2  - This article utilizes social network analysis (SNA) and associated statistical techniques to examine a complex process known as Sentence Management in a Scottish Prison Service facility. Findings indicate that communication did not always follow the formal hierarchical process defined by that organization, significant fragmentation existed between certain key roles, and four central actors controlled much of the process. This research demonstrates the applicability of the SNA as an operations management tool to analyse structural communication patterns. This case study further suggests that SNA may be particularly applicable to the public service sector, to better understand informal communication networks within operations that are largely dependent on human performance.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and correlates of lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) among HIV-infected male inmates. All participants in seven prisons, comprising roughly 20% of all HIV-infected male inmates in Taiwan, were stratified by geographic location and surveyed using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire. The five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) was used on 535 participants to measure various dimensions of psychological distress. Seven questions regarding lifetime psychiatric symptoms were also added to the questionnaire. Questionnaire results in this sample revealed that 23.7% had suffered depressive symptoms for at least two weeks, 20.6% experienced serious anxiety or tension symptoms, 12.5% had serious thoughts of suicide symptoms, and 4.1% had made a suicide attempt. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that SI was significantly related to (1) recent psychological distress, and (2) lifetime experience of depression for two weeks or more, serious anxiety or tension, or hallucinations. Since nearly 70% of the respondents reported at least one psychiatric symptom in their lifetime, it would seem important to target HIV-infected male inmates with mental health interventions and suicide prevention.

N2  - Both heroin-addicted individuals and methadone maintenance patients are likely to face untreated opioid withdrawal while incarcerated. Limited research exists concerning the withdrawal experiences of addicted inmates and their impact on individuals' attitudes and plans concerning drug abuse treatment. In the present study, 53 opioid dependent adults (32 in methadone treatment and 21 out of treatment) were interviewed in an ethnographic investigation of withdrawal experiences during incarceration. When treatment for opioid withdrawal was unavailable, detoxification experiences were usually described as negative and were often associated with a variety of unhealthy behaviors designed to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Negative methadone withdrawal experiences also negatively influenced participants' receptivity to seeking methadone treatment upon release. A minority of participants took a positive view of their withdrawal experience and saw it as an opportunity to detox from heroin or discontinue methadone. Findings support the importance of providing appropriate opioid detoxification and/or maintenance therapy to opioid-dependent inmates.

N2  - Abstract In this paper we aim to discuss how Portuguese prisoners know and what they feel about surveillance mechanisms related to the inclusion and deletion of the DNA profiles of convicted criminals in the national forensic database. Through a set of interviews with individuals currently imprisoned we focus on the ways this group perceives forensic DNA technologies. While the institutional and political discourses maintain that the restricted use and application of DNA profiles within the national forensic database protects individuals’ rights, the prisoners claim that police misuse of such technologies potentially makes it difficult to escape from surveillance and acts as a mean of reinforcing the stigma of delinquency. The prisoners also argue that additional intensive and extensive use of surveillance devices might be more protective of their own individual rights and might possibly increase potential for exoneration.

N2  - Background
Behaviors associated with opioid dependence often involve criminal activity, which can lead to incarceration. The impact of a history of incarceration on outcomes in primary care office-based buprenorphine/naloxone is not known.
Objective
The purpose of this study is to determine whether having a history of incarceration affects response to primary care office-based buprenorphine/naloxone treatment.
Design
In this post hoc secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, we compared demographic, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes among 166 participants receiving primary care office-based buprenorphine/naloxone treatment stratifying on history of incarceration.
Main Results
Participants with a history of incarceration have similar treatment outcomes with primary care office-based buprenorphine/naloxone than those without a history of incarceration (consecutive weeks of opioid-negative urine samples, 6.2 vs. 5.9, p = 0.43; treatment retention, 38% vs. 46%, p = 0.28).
Conclusions
Prior history of incarceration does not appear to impact primary care office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine/naloxone. Community health care providers can be reassured that initiating buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid dependent individuals with a history of incarceration will have similar outcomes as those without this history.

N2  - We assessed the contraceptive needs of women in jails and their sexually transmitted disease (STD) history and risk to determine effective contraceptive methods for this population. A survey of demographics, sexual health, contraceptive use, and preferred method of contraception was completed by participants recruited at jails in a medium-sized metropolitan area. Results from 188 women indicated high rates of STDs, inconsistent contraceptive use, and use of unreliable and user-dependent contraception methods. Intended contraceptive use following release varied depending on women's ability to bear children. Women planning to use condoms after release were more likely to have had an STD and more sexual partners than were women not planning to use condoms. Racial differences were found for participants' sexual health and contraception histories. These women were at high risk for STDs and appeared to need education about contraception methods. Therefore, they might benefit from education on safe sex practices provided prior to release.

N2  - ABSTRACTThe possible influence of traumatic experiences on subsequent manifestations of psychosis has been the subject of intense scientific debate in the last decade. Whereas some authors have found a clear association between trauma and psychosis, others have pointed out methodological deficiencies in the research or have found only weak associations. Others found no association between trauma and psychosis in exclusive samples of men and recommend the use of studies stratified by sex. This article uses the data from an epidemiological study of a random sample of 500 male inmates in two prisons in Andalusia (Spain) to analyze the association between psychosis and trauma. The inmates were diagnosed using The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) interviews by teams of experienced clinicians. The results show a clear association between traumatic events and some functional psychosis or some psychosis, including induced psychoses. These associations resist the possible effect of confusing variables such as the origin of the inmates, educational level, or having an addictive disorder. We discuss the need to pay special attention to traumatic experiences such as witnessing extreme violence against others or participating in acts of violence, particularly in men. Our results are compatible with different theories that defend the association between trauma and psychosis.

N2  - Objectives. We examined whether incarcerated women would substantially increase birth control initiation if contraceptive services were available within the prison compared with after their release back into the community.
Methods. During phase 1 of the study, a nurse educator met with women at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institute and offered them referrals for contraceptive services at a community health clinic after their release. During phase 2, contraceptive services were offered to women during their incarceration.
Results. The majority of the participants (77.5%) reported a desire to initiate use of birth control methods. Within 4 weeks of their release, 4.4% of phase 1 participants initiated use of a contraceptive method, compared with 39.1% of phase 2 participants (odds ratio [OR]=14.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.5, 38.8).
Conclusions. Provision of contraceptive services to women during their incarceration is feasible and greatly increases birth control initiation compared to providing services only in the community.

N2  - Objectives. We describe behavioral health diagnoses and community release patterns among adult male and female inmates in New Jersey prisons and assess their implications for correctional health care and community reentry.
Methods. We used clinical and classification data on a census of “special needs” inmates (those with behavioral health disorders) in New Jersey (n=3189) and a census of all special needs inmates released to New Jersey communities over a 12-month period (n=974).
Results. Virtually all adult inmates with special needs had at least 1 Axis I mental disorder, and 68% of these had at least 1 additional Axis I mental disorder, a personality disorder, or addiction problem (67% of all male and 75% of all female special needs inmates). Of those special needs inmates released, 25% returned to the most disadvantaged counties in New Jersey (27% of all male and 18% of all female special needs inmates).
Conclusions. Two types of clustering were found: gender-specific clustering of disorders among inmates and spatial clustering of ex-offenders in impoverished communities. These findings suggest a need for gendered treatment strategies within correctional settings and need for successful reentry strategies.

N2  - Improvements in community health care quality through error reduction have been slow to transfer to correctional settings. We convened a panel of correctional experts, which recommended 60 patient safety standards focusing on such issues as creating safety cultures at organizational, supervisory, and staff levels through changes to policy and training and by ensuring staff competency, reducing medication errors, encouraging the seamless transfer of information between and within practice settings, and developing mechanisms to detect errors or near misses and to shift the emphasis from blaming staff to fixing systems. To our knowledge, this is the first published set of standards focusing on patient safety in prisons, adapted from the emerging literature on quality improvement in the community.

N2  - Background Cellular cardiomyoplasty is emerging as a potentially novel therapeutic option for heart failure and typically involves direct intramyocardial injection of donor cells into a beating heart. Yet, limited rates of cell engraftment remain an obstacle to be overcome before cell therapy is fully recognized. Mechanical and biological mechanisms may account for observed donor cell loss. This study examines acute mechanical loss during intramyocardial injections in beating and arrested hearts. Materials and methods A porcine cardiopulmonary bypass model was used. Animals underwent either beating ( n = 5) or arrested ( n = 5) intramyocardial injections into the left ventricle. Fluorescent microspheres were used in lieu of cells because they are biologically inert. Thirty minutes after delivery, animals were euthanized. Microspheres in cardiac and peripheral tissues were quantified using flow cytometry. Results Approximately 10% of microspheres were retained within the site of injection in both groups. There was no statistical difference between microsphere retention rates in either the beating or the arrested heart group. Microspheres were found in peripheral organs, pericardial fluid, and the delivery device. Conclusions The majority of microspheres injected intramyocardially are lost in both beating and arrested hearts. Cardiac standstill does not enhance microsphere retention. Possible mechanisms include leakage from the injection site and washout via the cardiac venous/lymphatic system. Delivery strategy will need to be modified if more cells are to be retained within the target organ.

N2  - Background:  Recent epidemiological efforts have demonstrated the utility of measuring individual differences in the severity of alcohol use along a single severity continuum marked by alcohol‐related problems, symptoms of alcohol dependence, and the social consequences of drinking. Translation of this utility to specialized clinical populations is not assured. The expected inter‐relationships among problems, symptoms and consequences, and enhanced sensitivity of combined assessments require confirmation in applied clinical settings.
Method:  Subjects were 245 incarcerated women who met Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test criteria for hazardous use of alcohol. Participants were recruited from a statewide adult correctional facility for an ongoing clinical trial testing the effectiveness of brief motivational interviewing on alcohol use and HIV risk behaviors. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 56 (M = 34.1, SD = 8.9), 71.4% were Caucasian, and 65.7% reported <12 years of education.
Results:  Analyses suggested that the 6 problems of alcohol abuse, 7 symptoms for alcohol dependence, and 14 alcohol‐related social consequences loaded to a single factor (0.38 to 0.85) that formed a continuum of alcohol severity. Contrary to epidemiological studies, physical fights and being arrested were the most prevalent consequences and were associated with lower alcohol severity in this population. Three of the five items that discriminated best between higher and lower alcohol severity were related to familial and relationship consequences.
Conclusions:  Consistent with epidemiological studies, alcohol severity can be measured among incarcerated hazardously drinking women on a single continuum that includes alcohol problems, symptoms, and social consequences. Replication of the expected alignment of problems and symptoms supports the construct validity of the continuum and further challenges the proposed hierarchical structure of abuse/dependence distinction. Large differences in rates of specific consequences and observed effectiveness of tailored social consequence items suggest the benefits of cross‐sample validation to improve evaluation of clinical outcomes.

N2  - In ?Torn Apart: How the Child Welfare System Destroys Black Families and How Abolition Can Build a Safer World,? Dorothy E. Roberts builds on years of research to create a thorough analysis of the US child welfare system. Roberts delivers a methodologically and theoretically rich book, which employs legal research, interviews, and media analysis to paint a vivid picture of how the child welfare system is both grounded in and furthers carceral systems. In keeping with the values of prison industrial complex (PIC) abolitionists, this book draws deeply from the experiences of advocates, activists, and those directly impacted by the child welfare system. Roberts offers multiple strategies for building a world that actually offers care for children without reinforcing racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and classist logics. Roberts melds historical context with interviews of child welfare workers, other academics, and activists. Her examples show how logics criminalizing poverty and enforcing colonial settler norms have legitimized a system that produces racial and class-based disparities and inequities in child removal and family surveillance. Roberts cites that Black children were 14% of the children in the United States in 2019, they represented 23% of the children in foster care nationally. These disparities become starker at the local level: In New York, Black children are 15% of the child population but 44% of the foster care population. Roberts explains that the links between the child welfare system and the carceral system are fundamental; at the root is the urge to criminalize, pathologize, and stigmatize poor people, people of color, queer people, indigenous people, and others who do not fit white middle class norms. This analysis is facilitated by Roberts' engagement with communities that are directly affected by both systems, and their assessment of these structures. Roberts writes that the theory underlying this book was forged in the crux of movements to abolish the prison industrial complex and to strengthen families in the face of surveillance and policing. Thus, this book is not only a feat in research but is also exemplary of the kind of important scholarship that can take place in alliance with social justice movements. Roberts also depicts how the current state of child welfare services was shaped by legislation that decreased funding for support and increased funding for policing, surveillance, and family separation. In 1996, Congress ended welfare by passing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. A year later, President Clinton signed the Adoption and Safe Families Act which incentivized sending children through foster care to be adopted rather than family reunification. Both of these laws passed in the aftermath of the 1994 Crime Law, creating an environment where the only ?support? for families in danger is anchored in the carceral system. Both the PIC and the child welfare system impinge on a person's right to ?raise the children they have in dignity.?1,2 As in her previous works, Roberts demonstrates how this tenet of reproductive justice is degraded by a system that observes pregnant people, waiting to prove that they are a danger to their child.3,4 Roberts demonstrates that surveillance moves beyond hospital drug tests and into classrooms, pediatric appointments, and even other social service agencies. This creates an environment where poor families, those most likely to come into contact with these various surveillance points, are most likely to be reported to child protective services, and ensnared in the carceral web. Roberts looks at affluent white neighborhoods in New York City to consider how children are cared for differently. As she describes, these neighborhoods have issues, but they are resolved without the threat of police and the carceral system, and with an assurance that needs like income, housing, and health care are met. While Roberts makes an important point about the necessity of social support, it is also important to remember that affluence and whiteness often occlude harm.5 This was the case for the six Black children who were adopted by Jennifer and Sara Hart, white women who abused them over many years and eventually killed them by driving their car over a cliff.6 As Roberts shows in her examination of this story, the ways that policing and family surveillance are absent from these neighborhoods also reinforces white supremacy, at the peril of Black families and other marginalized children. The relevance of ?Torn Apart? was clear when The Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), which was created to address the genocidal practice of removing indigenous children from their families. Weakening ICWA would have allowed the child welfare system to be used to continue the weakening indigenous communities, which are also over-criminalized.7 Additionally, child protective services have been weaponized against parents of trans and gender nonconforming children, with legislation to this effect in Texas and Florida.8,9 As Roberts warned, these are instances of the child welfare system being mobilized against groups who are oppressed because of their gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. Among her suggestions for transforming child welfare, Roberts consistently reiterates the necessity of addressing poverty by strengthening funding and support for families. These suggestions are opportunities for researchers in public health, reproductive justice, and racial justice to engage questions that bolster the goals of advocates attempting to reduce the harms of the child welfare system. Furthermore, medical providers and other direct service providers can take lessons from this book about ways to offer care for children that do not engage the child welfare and carceral systems. Finally, ?Torn Apart? should serve as a cautionary tale: those of us who seek to provide care cannot allow underlying logics of racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia to go unchallenged because we risk creating systems that reinforce those logics.

N2  - Aims. This study examined the impact of residential aftercare on recidivism following prison‐based treatment for drug‐involved offenders. Design. A matched group quasi‐experimental design. Survival regression analyses were used to predict time until rearrest. A logistic regression model was constructed for predicting aftercare completion. Setting. A 9‐month in‐prison therapeutic community (ITC) and several communitybased transitional therapeutic communities (TTCs). Participants. Data were collected from 396 male inmates (293 treated, 103 untreated). Measurements. Background information (gender, ethnicity, age, education level, criminal history and risk for recidivism) was ed from the state criminal justice databases and a structured interview led by clinical staff. During treatment process measures were based on inmate self‐ratings of their counselors, program and peers. A post‐treatment interview conducted by field research staff assessed satisfaction with transitional aftercare. Post‐release recidivism was based on state‐maintained computerized criminal history records. Findings. ITC treatment, especially when followed by residential aftercare, was effective for reducing post‐release recidivism rates. Lower satisfaction with transitional aftercare treatment was associated with not completing the residential phase of community‐based aftercare. Conclusions. Corrections‐based treatment policy should emphasize a continuum of care model (from institution to community) with high quality programs and services .

N2  - Monsters, Catastrophes and the Anthropocene: A Postcolonial Critique explores European and Western imaginaries of natural disaster, mass migration and terrorism through a postcolonial inquiry into modern conceptions of monstrosity and catastrophe.
This book uses established icons of popular visual culture in sci-fi, doomsday and horror films and TV series, as well as in images reproduced by the news media to help trace the genealogy of modern fears to ontologies and logics of the Anthropocene. By logics of the Anthropocene, the book refers to a set of principles based on ontologies of exploitation, extermination and natural resource exhaustion processes determining who is worthy of benefiting from value extraction and being saved from the catastrophe and who is expendable. Fears for the loss of isolation from the unworthy and the expendable are investigated here as originating anxieties against migrants’ invasions, terrorist attacks and planetary catastrophes, in a thread that weaves together re-emerging ‘past nightmares’ and future visions.
This book will be of great interest to students and academics of the Environmental Humanities, Human and Cultural Geography, Political Philosophy, Psychosocial Studies, Postcolonial Studies and Critical Race and Whiteness Studies, Gender Studies and Postcolonial Feminist Studies, Cultural Studies, Sociology, Cultural Anthropology, Cinema Studies and Visual Studies.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease constitutes a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Left untreated, it progresses inexorably to greater levels of severity at variable rates. The morbid impact of chronic kidney disease is heightened by its role as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the past two decades, considerable gains have been realized in retarding progression of chronic kidney disease by emphasizing blood pressure control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Notwithstanding, the therapeutic goal of preventing or arresting chronic kidney disease progression remains unfulfilled. Currently attainable rates of decrease in glomerular filtration rate remain at 2 to 8 mL/min/y depending on the underlying disease. It is now believed that to achieve optimal therapeutic targets (proteinuria of <500 mg/day and decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 1 mL/min/y, the average age-related decline) we must introduce novel strategies and a multifaceted approach to treatment that interrupts multiple mechanisms of progression. To this end, and wherever relevant, new approaches to cause-specific treatment must be applied, such as targeted immunosuppression, intensive glycemic control, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, in all chronic kidney disease, we must interfere more effectively with the multitude of common mechanisms of progression. Established or putative, such approaches include aggressive blood pressure control; advanced renin-angiotensin system blockade; cytokine modulation and antifibrotic therapy; aldosterone blockade; endothelin blockade, nitric oxide modulation and vasopeptidase inhibition; antioxidant therapy; statin therapy; glycosaminoglycan therapy; anemia therapy; dietary restrictions; lifestyle changes; and pharmacogenomic profiling. Such a concerted, multifaceted approach to management might indeed prevent or arrest progression of chronic kidney disease, or even achieve regression of chronic kidney disease.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To determine if incarceration was associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and identify risk factors for incarceration among injection drug users (IDUs) participating in an HIV vaccine trial in Bangkok.
Design  The AIDSVAX B/E HIV vaccine trial was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study. A proportional hazards model was used to evaluate demographic characteristics, risk behavior and incarceration as predictors of HIV infection and generalized estimation equation logistic regression analysis to investigate demographic characteristics and risk behaviors for predictors of incarceration.
Setting  The trial was conducted in Bangkok Metropolitan Administration drug‐treatment clinics, 1999–2003.
Participants  A total of 2546 HIV‐uninfected IDUs enrolled in the trial.
Measurements  HIV testing was performed and an interviewer‐administered questionnaire was used to assess risk behavior and incarceration at baseline and every 6 months for a total of 36 months.
Findings  HIV incidence was 3.4 per 100 person‐years [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.0–3.9] and did not differ among vaccine and placebo recipients. In multivariable analysis, being in jail (P < 0.04), injecting (P < 0.0001), injecting daily (P < 0.0001) and sharing needles (P = 0.02) were associated with HIV infection and methadone maintenance was protective (P = 0.0006). Predictors of incarceration in multivariable analysis included: male sex (P = 0.04), younger age (P < 0.0001), less education (P = 0.001) and being in jail (P < 0.0001) or prison (P < 0.0001) before enrollment.
Conclusions  Among IDUs in the AIDSVAX B/E trial, incarceration in jail was associated with incident HIV infection. IDUs in Thailand remain at high risk of HIV infection and additional prevention tools are needed urgently. HIV prevention services, including methadone, should be made available to IDUs.

N2  - Although evidence is emerging that enhanced thinking skills (ETS) interventions are effective in reducing recidivism in prisoners, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of ETS improving behaviour and functioning in prisoners with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) traits. This study investigated the effectiveness of a group ETS programme in improving antisocial attitudes, anger regulation and social problem-solving skills in offenders with traits diagnostic of ASPD. A controlled trial was conducted comparing ETS programme with treatment as usual (TAU). Outcome measures were the Antisocial Personality Questionnaire, the Novaco Anger Scale and the Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Short Form. Significant improvements in the ETS group on all of the outcome measures were evident, when compared to TAU group. This study provides evidence that cognitive skills programmes based on ETS improve functioning in offenders with traits diagnostic of ASPD. The ETS programmes may be a therapeutic option when working with this historically difficult to treat group. However, further research is required that includes a randomised design, more objective behavioural outcome measures and a longer follow-up period.

N2  - This thesis explores the racist and sexist redefinition, regulation, and dehumanisation of refugee and asylum seeking women (RASW) in the UK. A feminist approach is taken to investigate how RASW are constructed as 'crimmigrants' and subjected to crime control measures through a 'crimmigration regime' that restricts their access to their human rights. The project aims to centre the lived experiences of RASW at the intersections of race, gender, and nationality, and also consider the ways in which they respond to their experiences. Qualitative methods were utilised to collect data through one-to-one conversations with 25 RASW over a 12-month period, with consideration for epistemic oppression and developing reciprocity in feminist research. These participants, as well as eight community allies, became involved with the project through the Meena Centre in Birmingham, and particularly the Baobab Women's Project. The study finds that RASW are criminalised beyond that which convicted criminals experience, dehumanised to extremes, and punished severely for supposed immigration crimes. This redefinition is enacted within the modern hostile environment RASW through 'immcarcerality,' which forces them to exist in carceral spaces and restricts their ability to access their human rights. These range from large scale spaces like immigration detention centres, to everyday 'immcarceral' spaces like asylum accommodation and Home Office reporting centres. The thesis concludes with a discussion about the agency enacted by RASW in responding to and challenging this dehumanising criminalisation.

N2  - Objectives. We estimated the effects of high incarceration rates on rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies.
Methods. We calculated correlations between rates of incarceration in state prisons and county jails and rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies for each of the 100 counties in North Carolina during 1995 to 2002. We also estimated increases in negative health outcomes associated with increases in incarceration rates using negative binomial regression analyses.
Results. Rates of sexually transmitted infections and teenage pregnancies, adjusted for age, race, and poverty distributions by county, consistently increased with increasing incarceration rates. In the most extreme case, teenage pregnancies exhibited an increase of 71.61 per 100000 population (95% confidence interval [CI]=41.88, 101.35) in 1996 after an increase in the prison population rate from 223.31 to 468.58 per 100000 population in 1995.
Conclusions. High rates of incarceration can have the unintended consequence of destabilizing communities and contributing to adverse health outcomes.

N2  - Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being show that approximately 1 in 8 (12.5%) children who are subjects of reports of maltreatment investigated by child welfare services (CWS) agencies have parents who were recently arrested. Compared with other children who come to the attention of CWS agencies, those with arrested parents are younger, disproportionately African American, and significantly more likely to be in out-of-home care. Approximately 2 in 5 children age 2 and older with arrested parents had a clinically significant emotional or behavioral problem, yet only 1 in 10 received mental health care. Although parent characteristics varied by race, rates of substance abuse, serious mental illness, domestic violence, and problems meeting basic needs were higher among arrested parents than among other parents.

N2  - HIV-infected prisoners face an inordinate number of community re-entry challenges. In 2007, 102 HIV-infected prisoners in Malaysia were surveyed anonymously within six months prior to release to assess the prevalence and correlates of community re-entry challenges. Staying out of prison (60.8%), remaining off drugs (39.2%), finding employment (35.3%) and obtaining HIV care (32.4%) were the re-entry challenges reported most frequently. Global stigma, negative self-image and public attitudes-related stigma were independently associated with challenges to obtaining HIV care. In multivariate analyses, those with previous incarcerations (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–7.6), higher HIV-related symptoms (AOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0–4.1) and higher public attitudes-related stigma (AOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2–5.1) had a significantly higher likelihood of identifying more re-entry challenges. Targeted interventions, such as effective drug treatment, HIV care and public awareness campaigns, are crucial for stemming the HIV epidemic and improving health outcomes among HIV-infected prisoners in Malaysia.

N2  - This chapter introduces the volume’s overarching arguments and contributions to the fields of trauma and motherhood studies in twenty-first-century literature and culture. Echoing Judith Herman’s Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence—From Domestic Abuse to Political Terror (1992), this volume is situated in a psychoanalytical framework. While trauma studies have been booming for the past 25 years since the publication of Cathy Caruth’s ground-breaking study, Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History (1996), surprisingly little critical attention has been given to the intersection of motherhood and trauma. The present volume aims at bridging this gap, as well as bringing to the forefront marginalized maternal experiences and voices, thus challenging stereotypical notions of motherhood as the ultimate fulfillment or as catharsis—especially in the wake of historical catastrophe. The contributions included here engage with a transnational corpus drawn from the five continents and span topics as under-studied as pregnancy denial, surrogacy, voluntary or involuntary childlessness, racism and motherhood, carceral mothering practices, surrogacy, IVF, artificial wombs, and mothering through war, genocide, and migration. Accompanied by an online creative supplement, this volume enhances a better understanding of the cathartic effects of storytelling.

N2  - Background:  The number of women incarcerated within the United States has risen dramatically in recent decades, and high rates of alcohol problems are evident among this population. Although little is known about the patterns of help utilization and efficacy for alcohol problems, preliminary evidence suggests that Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a widely available resource for this population.
Methods:  Data were collected as part of a study evaluating the effect of a brief intervention to reduce alcohol use among hazardously drinking (i.e., score of 8 or above on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test or 4 or more drinks at a time on at least 3 days in prior 3 months) incarcerated women. The current study characterized demographic, clinical, and previous AA attendance variables associated with AA attendance in the 6 months following incarceration. Associations between frequency of AA attendance and drinking outcomes following incarceration were also evaluated.
Results:  Among the 224 participants who provided data about AA attendance, 54% reported some AA attendance during the follow‐up assessment period. AA attendance in the year prior to study entry (OR = 4.02; 95% CI: 3.32 to 4.71) and greater baseline consequences of alcohol use (OR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.73 to 2.44) were associated with increased odds of higher frequency of AA attendance following incarceration. Weekly or greater AA attendance was associated with reductions in negative drinking consequences (B = −0.45; p < 0.01) and frequency of drinking days (B = −0.28; p < 0.01) following incarceration.
Conclusions:  Findings from this study suggest that AA is frequently utilized by hazardously drinking women following incarceration. Alcohol outcomes may be enhanced by AA attendance at a weekly or greater frequency is associated with better alcohol outcomes relative to lower levels of AA attendance. Evaluation of clinical guidelines for prescribing AA attendance for incarcerated women remains a task for future research.

N2  - This chapter examines carcerality in the United States as a condition of racialized temporal theft and entrapment of those subject to arrest in time and space. It considers how segregated carceral temporalities extend well beyond prison spaces and time served. Contemporary mass incarceration is frequently understood to be a reactionary response to people of color moving “too fast” and igniting racial blowback. Complicating and appending such accounts, the chapter explores how race functions as a forward-looking predictive technology, while also registering innovative race-making projects emerging from nonlinear forms of temporal arrest and capture. The weaponization of time and criminalization of racial difference are co-implicated in the regeneration of segregated time where children of color are apprehended as sites of future dangerousness. The insularity, myopia, and deafness of white temporality spurs reflections on forms of “white noise” and affective economies of pleasure and cruelty that fortify segregated time. The last section situates the analysis of carceral temporality in the context of debates over prison abolition by avowing the haunting copresence of slavery and colonial dispossession that conjoins the segregated time of prison system to racial capitalism and imperial futurity. The chapter initiates the kind of time-sensitive theoretical promiscuity the foregoing analysis enjoins by staging an encounter between decolonial theory, Michel Foucault, and Black Panther revolutionary George Jackson.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to determine the prevalence of major mental disorders and substance abuse in adolescents admitted to a juvenile detention center. METHOD: As part of a routine mental health screening, modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children were administered to 50 youths (11-17 years old) at an urban juvenile detention center. RESULTS: A high rate of affective disorder (42%) was found among these adolescents: 10 (20%) met criteria for mania, another 10 met criteria for major depressive disorder, and one met criteria for bipolar disorder, mixed type. Thirty (60%) met criteria for conduct disorder, and very high rates of alcohol, marijuana, and other substance dependence were found. There was a strong association between affective disorder and conduct disorder; adolescents with mania had much higher rates of reported abuse of substances other than alcohol or marijuana. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile offenders have high rates of affective disorder. Further studies are needed to examine the relationship of affective disorder to substance abuse as well as to antisocial behavior.

N2  - Department of Health guidelines (Bradley, 2009) suggest that transfers of prisoners with mental health problems to hospital using the Mental Health Act should take 14 days from first assessment to transfer. This study examines the extent to which transfers of women prisoners from a large women's prison in England is meeting this target. It considers in detail 100 recommendations for hospitalisation and analyses the process to establish rate of transfer and where applicable reasons for slow transfer. Of the 86 women who completed transfer, the process took 37 days (median) with only 13% of cases being moved within the 14-day recommended period. This study also found that legal routes intended for urgent hospitalisation were no quicker than other methods. The study recommends review of Section 48, the urgent treatment order.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study obtained comprehensive health information from newly admitted correctional inmates. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 1198 inmates on day 3 of their incarceration. RESULTS: Interviewers found a high prevalence of chronic medical and mental health issues, limited access to health care, high rates of infections and sexually transmitted diseases, substantial substance abuse, other unhealthy behaviors and violence, and a strong desire for help with health-related problems. CONCLUSIONS: The data document the need to apply the public health approach to correctional health care, including detection and early treatment of disease, education and prevention to facilitate health and behavior change, and continuity of care into the community.

N2  - In the current study, children's reactions to video messages from their incarcerated parents were evaluated. Previous research has yielded mixed results when it examined the impact of contact between incarcerated parents and their children; one reason for these mixed results may be a lack of attention to the quality of contact. This is the first study to examine the actual content and quality of a remote form of contact in this population. Participants included 186 incarcerated parents (54% mothers) who participated in a filming with The Messages Project and 61 caregivers of their children. Parental mood prior to filming the message and children's mood after viewing the message were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. After coding the content of 172 videos, the data from the 61 videos with caregiver responses were used in subsequent path analyses. Ana-lyses indicated that when parents were in more negative moods prior to filming their message, they displayed more negative emotions in the video messages (= .210), and their children were in more negative moods after viewing the message (= .288). Considering that displays of negative emotion can directly affect how children respond to contact, it seems important for parents to learn to regulate these emotional displays to improve the quality of their contact with their children.

N2  - Objective. To examine the relationship between the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and prisoners using recent statistics.
Design. An analysis of published data from 158 countries.
Methods. Multiple linear regression techniques were used to examine the relationship between per capita measures of income and numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and the dependant variable of per capita prison populations, in high and low‐and‐middle‐income countries.
Results. Prison and psychiatric populations were positively correlated in low‐and‐middle‐income countries. There was no relationship between the number of psychiatric hospital beds and prison populations in high‐income countries.
Conclusions. In low‐and‐middle income countries the association between prison and psychiatric hospital populations may depend on the ability of governments to pay for custodial institutions as well as differences in cultural attitudes towards abnormal and criminal behaviour. In high‐income (HI) countries psychiatric and prison populations are not related and probably determined by separate social and political factors.

N2  - Aim:  The aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the health problems for which primary care services are provided to adolescents in a juvenile detention facility in Europe.
Methods:  We reviewed the medical files of all detainees in a juvenile detention centre in Switzerland in 2007. The health problems for which primary care services were provided were coded using the International Classification for Primary Care, version 2. Analysis was descriptive, stratified by gender.
Results:  A total of 314 adolescents (18% female) aged 11–19 years were included. Most (89%) had a health assessment and 195 (62%) had consultations with a primary care physician; 80% of the latter had a physical health problem, and 60% had a mental health problem. The most commonly managed problems were skin (49.7%), respiratory (23.6%), behavioural (22.6%) and gynaecological problems (females: 23.9%); 13% females (no males) had sexually transmitted infections (STI), and 8.7% were pregnant. Substance abuse was common (tobacco: 64.6%, alcohol: 26.2%, cannabis: 31.3%).
Conclusion:  In addition to health problems known to be more prevalent among young offenders, such as mental health problems and STI, these adolescent detainees required care for a range of common primary care problems. These data should inform the development of comprehensive primary care services in all juvenile detention facilities in Europe.

N2  - Housed in a former monkey enclosure, the colonial archive of London Zoo is home to a series of recherché pro formas known as the Daily Occurrences of the Zoological Gardens of London (1828-2002). These institutional diaries are the keys that my interdisciplinary research uses to unlock debates about the exhibition, framing, and representation of captive animals. Now collecting dust on neglected shelves, these quotidian documents once helped facilitate the central practices of the zoo, recording animal arrivals and departures, animal births and deaths, sales and exchanges, visitor numbers, zoological work, and finances on a daily basis. This thesis argues that these working documents provide an alternative history of the zoo because they tell us how animals were practically written about and perceived by the institution that framed them. What is discovered is that exemplary classifications at London Zoo were undermined in a number of ways, including: the spread of an infectious virus originating amongst exotic animals, deposited by Lord Moyne, where staff members at the zoo became the subjects of medical discourse; the physical disassemblage of an elephant sold to the Crystal Palace Company for display which speaks to the extractive processes of imperial economics; and, the aftermath of the murder of a migrant worker in the enclosure for tapirs, recorded in the staff absent section, which leads to a series of legal and medical pro formas that contain a complex history of carceral and clinical practices. These archival recuperations speak to the complex relationships that existed between humans and animals in this nineteenth-century imperial institution. Unidentified stains are smudged across the pro forma pages, and muck is encrusted onto the paper surfaces of this compilation of fur and flesh, allowing us to peer behind the structures that framed animals as living monuments. This thesis argues that an interdisciplinary approach to London Zoo contributes to wider histories of classification and its impact on how animals and humans have been written about in, and beyond, literature.

N2  - This study investigated the adverse effects of exposure to inmate or peer aggression, type D‐personality and their interactions on post‐traumatic stress reactions among a sample of prison workers. The basic tenet of type D‐personality is that not so much the experience of negative emotions per se is responsible for negative health consequences, but rather the way individuals cope with such emotions. Many studies have revealed diverse adverse health outcomes of type D‐personality, particularly among cardiac patients. However, the moderating effect of social inhibition has never been statistically examined in other populations. Participants (111 men, 40 women) were recruited in 10 Dutch correctional institutions. The results showed that victims of aggression are more prone to develop Post‐traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms than non‐victims, although this particularly applied to victims of peer aggression. Furthermore, an interaction effect was observed between inmate aggression and type D‐personality. Finally, both peer aggression and type D‐personality contributed to the development of PTSD. The results were discussed together with recommendations for future research. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The study aimed to determine the mental health, social outcomes and needs of mothers who had been in prison when their children were infants. The mean time between first interview and follow-up was 4.53 years. Mothers who had been in a prison mother and baby unit (MBU) were compared with women who had been separated from infants whilst in prison. Of 167 interviewed previously, 87 were located, and 60 completed a semi-structured interview. Prevalence of depression and hazardous drinking were higher at follow-up. Those not caring for the index child at follow-up were more likely to have an interview diagnosis of personality disorder or psychotic disorder and to have been reconvicted than those who were. Seventy-seven percent of children who were in prison MBUs were being cared for by their mother at follow-up compared to 20% of those who had been separated in prison.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence, multiple correlates, and gender differences in chlamydia and gonorrhea infections among adolescents, aged 13 to 18, incarcerated in a youth detention center in the southern region of the United States. Goal: The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with juvenile offenders' sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk that may guide the development of interventions specifically tailored for this population. Study: The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey. Results: Rates of undiagnosed chlamydia were 24.7% for incarcerated girls and 8.1% for boys. Gonorrhea was detected in 7.3% of the girls and 1.5% of the boys. Predictors of STD positivity differed for boys and girls. Demographic characteristics (gender, race, and age) account for 52% of the total variance in STD infections; youths' behavior accounts for approximately one third of the total variance, and psychologic and family variables account for 8.6% and 7.2% of the total variance, respectively. Conclusions: An approach that considers psychologic and social influences on adolescent sexual behavior is useful for identifying potential risk and protective factors of adolescent STD/HIV risk that are amenable to intervention.

N2  - Correctional facilities are prime targets for nursing interventions to decrease health disparities, but challenges to post‐release follow‐up limit use of the longitudinal research designs needed to fully examine intervention effects. Using an adapted version of the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations, we determined predictors of 1‐year post‐release study retention and subsequent reenrollment an average of 3 years later in 88 mother and child dyads recruited from a state prison nursery. Predisposing characteristics and enabling factors emerged as strong predictors of loss to follow‐up. Female research participants can be successfully retained years after release from a correctional facility. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to post‐release follow‐up supports the creation of theoretically informed strategies to retain formerly incarcerated populations. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - This dissertation examines the intersecting histories of disability and United States imperialism between about 1850 and 1930. Through two major case studies—the experiences of the Umonhon Nation and the construction of the Panama Canal—this project reveals the central claim that the history of United States imperialism cannot be fully understood without attention to literal and figurative processes of disablement, and to the ideological power of ableism. It argues, moreover, that the American expansionary project rested on a logic of “imperial ableism,” a collusion of feelings and forces that assessed and identified people, ways of life, and the landscapes with which they were entwined as somehow disabled, and then used a deep intolerance of that disability to justify controlling, correcting, or eliminating them. Chapter 1 introduces the history of the Umonhon, tracing the spiritual systems that bound people, cultures, and landscapes together. Many Euro-Americans, however, identified the Umonhon as a retrograde barrier to western development, and their ways of life as simultaneously too mobile and not mobile enough. Close attention to the life of one Umonhon leader, Joseph La Flesche, demonstrates how Euro-American medicine and disability technologies—in this case, artificial limbs—acted as tools and symbols of American promise and power. Chapter 2 examines further disruptions to Indigenous lifeways, as the loss of the buffalo and confinement to reservations led to enduring physical and psychic injury. This chapter also contends that the Umonhon and their close relations, the Ponca, re-deployed ableism’s tropes to make powerful claims for self-determination, particularly in the heavily publicized case of Standing Bear v. Crook. Chapter 3 continues by demonstrating how the United States government used the notion of “competency,” a category that combined assessments of race, land use, cultural assimilation, and physical and cognitive ability, to make decisions about which Umonhon could hold patent to their land. Though it met with various forms of Umonhon resistance and remaking, competency, I argue, was an explicitly imperial ableist invention that facilitated the dispossession of lands and the dispersal of peoples and cultures. It was also deeply improvisational, opportunistic, and exploitative, evidence of how imperial ableism’s power was made through its mutability and its slippages. The final three chapters take up similar themes in a different context: the construction of the Panama Canal and American control of the Canal Zone. Chapter 4 argues that the Canal project rested on an obsession with governing movement, which took place at four distinct but mutually reinforcing scales: the movement of ships, goods, and military might around the world; the movement of earth to create the canal; the movement of foreign workers in and out of the isthmus; and the personal mobility—on artificial legs, in many cases—of the many thousands of labourers who were injured in the course of construction. Chapter 5 looks more deeply at other examples of disability in the Canal Zone, with specific attention to two carceral sites operated by the Americans: the “Cripple Farm” and the Asylum at Corozal. Both, I argue, troubled the epochal, numinous futurity that formed the dominant narrative of the Panama Canal. Finally, Chapter 6 examines Panama’s American-run leprosarium, Palo Seco, yet another place where imperial ableism sought to contain, remake, or simply eliminate disability. It was also a site of complex emotions, testifying to the ragged edges and profound affect of the imperial enterprise and its ableist institutions, affect that survives and arises again in new forms in the imperial archive. United States expansion, this project contends, rested on ableist assumptions about who and what qualified to be part of the body politic. Across these chapters, experiences of disability and ableism emerge not simply through experiences and assessments of bodies and minds, but across axes of time and motion, culture and spirituality, environments and uses of the land. Imperial ableism, this dissertation concludes, operated in explicit and subtle ways, across vast terrains of emotions, geographies, cultures, and individuals.

N2  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe preincarceration risk behaviors of young men and identify correlates of unprotected sex with multiple partners during the 3 months before incarceration. Study: Data on preincarceration risk behaviors were obtained from 550 men, aged 18 to 29 years, in state prisons in California, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Correlates of unprotected sex with multiple partners were determined by logistic regression. Results: Of 550 participants, 71% had multiple sex partners, 65.1% had sex with a partner they perceived as risky, and 45.3% engaged in unprotected sex with multiple partners. Men who drank heavily (odds ratio [OR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.112.54) or who had a risky partner (OR, 3.90; 95% CI, 2.60-5.85) were more likely to report unprotected sex with multiple partners. Men who attended religious gatherings (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.96) or lived in stable housing (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48-1.00) were less likely to report unprotected sex with multiple partners. Conclusions: Most participants engaged in behaviors that could result in a sexually transmitted disease, including HIV. Prevention programs should address the relationship between heavy alcohol use and risky sexual behavior. Discharge planning should address housing needs. Faith-based community organizations may play an important role for some young men in their transition to the community.

N2  - Abstract Prisoners have generally been excluded from donation because of ethical and infectious disease concerns. We propose a plan, which would address both concerns and examine the potential impact. Interested inmates would approach the prison's medical team expressing interest in living donation (LD). Principle steps in the process are (1) consent to evaluation and a two-step surgical consent. (2) Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A standard LD workup would be initiated. If the results were acceptable, the inmate would sign the first surgical consent. NAAT for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatits B and C virus would be performed 3 weeks apart. Assuming acceptable results, prisoner and family would sign the second consent, and the inmate would be scheduled for LD surgery. The inmate would be in medical isolation until the time of donation. NAAT testing has enabled the window period to be small enough to allow close observation and monitoring of the prisoner, enabling safe donation. The paternalistic protection of prisoners would ensure that experiments were not performed. This plan would allow prisoners the ability to participate in opportunities provided noninmate people. There are currently 2.2 million inmates; the incidence of HIV is 1.8%, decreasing the potential pool to 2.1 million. A donation rate of 1% could provide 21,000 kidneys. Advances in medical technology and the acknowledgment that prisoners can consent to complex but standard medical procedures have opened up a potential pool of organ donors that could dramatically impact the organ shortage.

N2  - Objectives. We sought to determine hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence, associated exposures, and incidence among male inmates at a state correctional facility.
Methods. A cross-sectional serological survey was conducted in June 2000, and susceptible inmates were retested in June 2001.
Results. At baseline, 230 inmates (20.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=18.2%, 22.9%) exhibited evidence of HBV infection, including 11 acute and 11 chronic infections. Inmates with HBV infection were more likely than susceptible inmates to have injected drugs (38.8% vs 18.0%; adjusted prevalence odds ratio [OR]=3.0; 95% CI=1.9, 4.9), to have had more than 25 female sex partners (27.7% vs 17.5%; adjusted prevalence OR=2.0; 95% CI=1.4, 3.0), and to have been incarcerated for more than 14 years (38.4% vs 17.6%; adjusted prevalence OR=1.7; 95% CI=1.1, 2.6). One year later, 18 (3.6%) showed evidence of new HBV infection. Among 19 individuals with infections, molecular analysis identified 2 clusters involving 10 inmates, each with a unique HBV sequence.
Conclusions. We documented ongoing HBV transmission at a state correctional facility. Similar transmission may occur at other US correctional facilities and could be prevented by vaccination of inmates.

N2  - Background:  Axis I psychiatric disorders (PD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are common in prison, but only few studies have focused on their association in this setting. Dual diagnosis (DD) (the co‐occurrence of a SUD and any axis I disorder) is known to have a poorer prognosis and to require more intense supportive care.
Objectives:  The objectives of this study were (1) to describe prisoners with DD (prevalence and characteristics); (2) to compare DD prisoners with 3 other groups of prisoners: no diagnosis (ND), SUD alone, or other isolated PD; and (3) to evaluate the impact of DD on suicide risk in prison.
Method:  A random stratified strategy was used to select 23 various types of prisons and 998 prisoners. Diagnoses were assessed using a unique procedure, each prisoner being evaluated by 2 psychiatrists, 1 junior, using a structured interview (MINI 5 plus), and 1 senior, using an open clinical interview. Following interviews, clinicians met to establish a list of diagnoses. Cloninger’s temperament and character inventory was also used.
Results:  Of the prisoners, 26.3% had a DD. DD prevalence was almost 80% in prisoners with SUD, while only one‐third of the prisoners with an axis I PD had co‐morbid SUD. No significant differences were observed in drug use patterns between DD and SUD without co‐morbid PDs. DD showed the strongest association with suicide risk [OR = 5.7 (1.7–4.6)].
Conclusion:  DD is very frequent in prison and is a major risk factor for suicide. Systematic psychiatric/SUD screening of prisoners with either a SUD or an axis I PD should be encouraged.

N2  - Aims: Archival data from structured interviews of 1193 male prison inmates were subjected to taxometric analysis to determine the latent structure of the alcohol use disorder construct. Methods: Analyses were performed using three taxometric procedures: mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC), maximum eigenvalue (MAXEIG), and latent mode factor analysis (L-Mode). Results: The outcomes were based on three indicators: (1) DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria 1 and 2 (tolerance/withdrawal), (2) DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria 3, 4, and 5 and DSM-IV alcohol abuse criterion 3 (loss of control), and (3) DSM-IV alcohol dependence criteria 6 and 7 and DSM-IV alcohol abuse criteria 1, 2, and 4 (negative social/psychological consequences). The outcomes revealed consistent support for a taxonic (categorical) interpretation of alcohol use disorders. Conclusions: There may be a taxonic boundary separating those who do and do not qualify for a diagnosis of alcohol dependence or abuse with important implications for diagnosis and treatment.

N2  - Background Methadone maintenance treatment is a widely used therapy in the rehabilitation of opioid addiction the world over. Methadone is metabolised in the body to a number of inactive metabolites, but primarily to 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP). The Division of Forensic Toxicology and Drug Abuse (DFTDA) of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health carries out drug analysis of urine samples from inmates of prisons throughout Norway. Methadone and EDDP in the urine are also tested for upon request. The results are stored in a secure database at the DFTDA.
Objectives The aims of the present study were (1) to observe variations in methadone and EDDP concentrations in urine in relation to urine pH in a large set of urine samples obtained from prison inmates and (2) to analyse samples testing methadone-positive/EDDP-negative and investigate whether such results could occur naturally, without sample tampering.
Methods All urine samples that tested positive for methadone over the period 2004-2005 were collected from the DFTDA database, and the relation between methadone and EDDP excretion in urine, and urinary pH was determined. Samples that tested positive for methadone but negative for EDDP were picked out and studied individually.
Results A total of 1539 urine samples (cases) had tested positive for methadone in our database for the period 2004-2005. There was a strong correlation between the concentration of methadone in urine and urine pH in these samples, with higher concentrations of methadone present at lower pH levels. Cases that tested positive for methadone but negative for EDDP were rare - a total of five (0.3% of all cases tested). These cases were studied in more detail.
Conclusion Methadone excretion in urine is dependent on urinary pH. Methadone-positive/EDDP-negative results may suggest sample tampering in some, but not all, cases.

N2  - To examine the psychiatric medication fill rates of adolescents after release from juvenile detention. The team reviewed 177 charts. A fill was defined as a psychiatric medication charge to Medicaid 30- or 90-days after release. Differences in demographic characteristics were compared among individuals with fills at 30- or 90-days and those with no medication fills. Forty-five percent of patients were on at least one psychiatric medication. Among detainees on a psychiatric medication, 62 % had a fill by 30 days after release, and 78 % by 90 days. At least 50 % of the adolescents on a psychiatric medication were on an atypical antipsychotic. There was no significant relationship between medication fill and race, age, or sex. Despite the known associations between mental health diagnosis and treatment-seeking with age, sex, and race, it appears that psychiatric medication fill patterns after release from detention are not associated with these factors.

N2  - Abstract This experimental pilot study compared postrelease outcomes for 115 women who participated in prison-based substance abuse treatment. Women were randomized to a gender-responsive treatment (GRT) program using manualized curricula (Helping Women Recover and Beyond Trauma) or a standard prison-based therapeutic community. Data were collected from the participants at prison program entry and 6 and 12 months after release. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results indicate that both groups improved in psychological well-being; however, GRT participants had greater reductions in drug use, were more likely to remain in residential aftercare longer (2.6 vs. 1.8 months, p < .05), and were less likely to have been reincarcerated within 12 months after parole (31% vs. 45%, respectively; a 67% reduction in odds for the experimental group, p < .05). Findings show the beneficial effects of treatment components oriented toward women's needs and support the integration of GRT in prison programs for women.

N2  - In the United States, women are a significant proportion of the correctional population. Women also account for an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases. When compared with white women, black women have higher incarceration rates and represent more of the newly diagnosed HIV cases. Correctional facilities offer an opportunity to provide women with HIV testing and prevention services so that they will know their status and receive HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk-reduction counseling and other preventive services. In this report, we describe incarcerated population statistics and HIV surveillance epidemiology for women. We also describe HIV prevention activities undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Additional research, program development, and implementation are needed to improve HIV prevention efforts for high-risk women.

N2  - Religion and spirituality (RS) as a coping resource for facing stressful life events is encountered with increasing frequency in the medical literature. RS is associated with more favourable outcomes among people suffering from mental disorders. Detention is a stressful situation and the prevalence of mental disorders in places of detention is increased compared with the community. This literature review examined the association between RS and the mental health of detainees. PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and the Internet were systematically searched from inception of each data base to August 1st 2010. Peer reviewed articles that reported primary empirical data about the impact of spirituality on the mental health and behaviour of detained persons were selected. Qualitative studies are also discussed. Twelve empirical studies including a total of 4,823 individuals met our inclusion criteria. RS is associated with lower frequency and severity of depressive episodes. The strongest reported effect of RS on prison life is a reduction of incidents and disciplinary sanctions. Prospective targeted studies are needed in order verify the hypothesis that RS reduces suicide among detainees.

N2  - The mortality in prisoners is high. However, our knowledge about the mortality in convicted offenders, irrespective of incarceration history, is limited. Our aim was to investigate possible predictors for over-all and cause specific mortality in a nation-wide study of convicted offenders with and without previous imprisonment. This case-control study drew random samples of deceased and living offenders (N = 1,112) from four complete cohorts of convicted offenders, two male (born 1967 and 1977, respectively), and two female (born 1967-70 and 1977-80, respectively). All criminal records were systematized and information about date and cause of death was collected on those deceased. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that age at first court conviction (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.93), drug related crimes (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.23-3.22), and crime diversity (1.51, 95% CI = 1.07-2.13) were significant predictors of premature death in males. In females, age at first court conviction (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.88-0.97), drug related crimes (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.37-3.69) and belonging to the oldest cohort (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.35-3.26) were significant predictors of premature death. Age at first court conviction remained a significant predictor for death in all cause specific multivariable mortality analyses. In addition, having committed drug related crimes and high crime diversity were strong predictors for substance related deaths. Males did more often die in accidents or commit suicide. Somatic deaths were most often encountered in the oldest cohort. Incarceration did not remain a significant predictor for premature death in any of the multivariable analyses. Measures intended to prevent premature death in convicted offenders should target wider populations than hitherto acknowledged.

N2  - Abstract Objectives: To identify risks for HIV infection related to incarceration among injecting drug users in Bangkok, Thailand. Design: Case-control study of sexual and parenteral exposures occurring before, during, and after the most recent incarceration. Setting: Metropolitan Bangkok. Participants: Non-prison based injecting drug users formerly incarcerated for at least six months in the previous five years, with documented HIV serostatus since their most recent release; 175 HIV positive cases and 172 HIV negative controls from methadone clinics. Main outcome measure: Injection of heroin and methamphetamine, sharing of needles, sexual behaviour, and tattooing before, during, and after incarceration. Results: In the month before incarceration cases were more likely than controls to have injected methamphetamine and to have borrowed needles. More cases than controls reported using drugs (60% v 45%; P=0.005) and sharing needles (50% v 31%; P<0.01) in the holding cell before incarceration. Independent risk factors for prevalent HIV infection included injection of methamphetamine before detention (adjusted odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 10.7), sharing needles in the holding cell (1.9, 1.2 to 3.0), being tattooed while in prison (2.1, 1.3 to 3.4), and borrowing needles after release (2.5, 1.3 to 4.4). Conclusions: Injecting drug users in Bangkok are at significantly increased risk of HIV infection through sharing needles with multiple partners while in holding cells before incarceration. The time spent in holding cells is an important opportunity to provide risk reduction counselling and intervention to reduce the incidence of HIV. What is already known on this topic The incidence of HIV in Thailand is highest among injecting drug users in Bangkok Incarceration is a risk factor for incident HIV infection among Thai injecting drug users What this study adds Injecting drug users are at increased risk of HIV infection from sharing needles with multiple partners while in police holding cells before incarceration Other risk factors include injecting methamphetamine before imprisonment, being tattooed while imprisoned, and sharing needles after release

N2  - ABSTRACT
Purpose: To estimate the prevalence of optic neuropathy (ON) among prisoners in a provincial prison in Papua New Guinea, and to explore risk factors for this condition among this population.
Methods: Cross-sectional observation study of 148 male prisoners aged 18 years using an interview-based questionnaire, assessment of visual and nervous system function, ocular examination, and blood analysis (α-tocopherol, β-carotene, lutein, folate, homocysteine, holotranscobalamin II, riboflavin, selenium, thiamin, and vitamins A, B12 and C). Likelihood of the presence of ON was based on ordered groups determined by weighted combination of optic nerve head appearance and visual dysfunction (acuity, field, color perception). Main outcome measures were prevalence and associations of ON.
Results: Sample prevalence of clinical ON was 10.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2-16.8). No cases were found of unexplained non-visual nervous system dysfunction, including peripheral neuropathy. Increasing age (p = 0.001), length of current (p = 0.002) and lifetime (p = 0.03) incarceration, and duration of smoking by current smokers (p = 0.001) were associated with increased ON likelihood. However, when age-controlled, the smoking duration association was not maintained (p = 0.6). Prisoners were folate deficient. Adjusting for age and duration of current incarceration, whole blood (p = 0.02) and red blood cell (p = 0.04) folate concentrations were inversely associated with ON likelihood. No association was found for any other assessed demographic, lifestyle or biochemical measure.
Conclusions: A cluster of ON associated with folate deficiency has been identified. Recommendations for dietary change and micronutrient supplementation have been made.

N2  - One of the least known fields of Australian public history is that of women's and children's welfare and incarceration, and of the institutions in which that history was played out over almost two centuries. Today only a handful of such sites dating from the period of convict settlement remain across Australia in varying states of disrepair and neglect. Of these, the earliest, by far the most extensive in area and the only one that spans the period from early colonisation to the modern era is the Parramatta Female Factory Precinct (PFFP). This twenty-three hectare historical site is located in Sydney's western suburbs approximately twenty kilometres from the Sydney CBD. It comprises a complex of over seventy buildings, the oldest dating back to the early nineteenth century. It was founded originally as an institution to hold unassigned female convicts and their children and came to include an orphanage, a mental asylum, a girls' home and, from 1980 to 2010, a women's prison.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of dental and root caries, periodontal conditions, and prosthetic status of prison inmates.
Design: Cross‐sectional survey.
Setting: Penal institutions in the Calabria region (Italy). Participants: A random sample of 544 prisoners.
Methods: Participants underwent a structured interview by trained interviewers and a dental examination.
Results: Only 2% had no history of caries. Mean DMFT and DMFS were 9.8 and 37.6 and missing teeth was the most prevalent component of the DMFT. Higher DMFT was found among older prisoners, having regular dental attendance, higher plaque index, and in those with a lower frequency of a tooth brushing habit. Conservative care and extractions were required by 61.9% and 33.3%. The mean plaque and gingival indices were 0.74 and 0.75; 10.5% had healthy periodontal tissues. The highest number of individuals was classified as having a CPI of 2, whereas 5% had at least one sextant with a CPI score of 4. Deep pockets were more likely in older subjects and in those with a lower frequency of a tooth brushing habit. A minimum of oral hygiene instruction was needed by 89.6%. Seven subjects were edentulous and 85.1% had a prosthetic treatment need.
Conclusions: This survey emphasises the need for programmes to improve the oral health of prisoners.

N2  - Background. In the treatment of offenders with personality disorders, one matter that requires attention is the rate of treatment non‐completion. This is important as it has cost‐efficiency and negative outcome implications.
Method. We compared the characteristics of those who participated in a personality disorder treatment programme divided into three groups: Group 1, treatment completers (N = 21); Group 2, those expelled for rule breaking (N = 16); and Group 3, those removed because they were not engaging in treatment (N = 19). We hypothesized that, compared with the other two groups, Group 2 would score higher on the impulsive/careless style scale, and that those in Group 3 would score higher on the avoidant style scale of the social problem‐solving inventory‐revised (SPSI‐R). Further, we hypothesized that high anxiety would be associated with treatment non‐completion in both the groups.
Results. These differences were not found. However, in combining both groups of non‐completers for comparison, completers were shown to score significantly higher on SPSI‐R rational problem solving and significantly lower on SPSI‐R impulsive/careless style.
Conclusion. Findings suggest that teaching impulsive people a rational approach to social problem solving may reduce their level of non‐completion.

N2  - Although psychopathy is frequently regarded as qualitatively distinct from other conditions, relatively little research has examined whether psychopaths represent a distinct class of individuals. Using a sample of 876 prison inmates and court-ordered substance abuse patients who were administered the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (
R. D. Hare, 2003
), the authors examined the latent structure of psychopathy using several taxometric procedures developed by Meehl and colleagues (
P. E. Meehl & L. J. Yonce, 1994
;
N. G. Waller & P. E. Meehl, 1998
). The results across these procedures offer no compelling support for the contention that psychopathy is a taxonic construct and contradict previous reports that psychopathy is underpinned by a latent taxon. The authors discuss the theoretical, public policy, and practice-level implications of these findings.

N2  - Recent government policy has emphasised the importance of a patient centred approach, based on individual needs, in service design and planning. Mental Health Inreach Services (MHIS) have been developed in UK prisons, designed on the principle of providing equivalence of care to community mental health teams (CMHTs). To date no studies have systematically examined the needs of patients on MHIS caseloads, let alone obtained these prisoner-patient views of their needs. This study is the first to describe the self-reported ratings of needs of male prisoners (n = 151) under the care of prison MHIS in the UK, using the forensic version of the Camberwell Assessment of Need Forensic - Short Version (CANFOR-S). Inmate medical records were examined and prisoners were interviewed to obtain their ratings of their needs. The results showed that prisoners on MHIS caseload have six needs on average, of which almost half (2.6) are unmet. The most frequent unmet needs were for: daytime activities, psychotic symptoms, psychological distress and accommodation. The findings have implications for commissioning and resource allocation for this population.

N2  - This dissertation addresses the technological and scientific contribution of kinetics to literary modes of representation. As Victorian scientists investigating the physical properties of bodies in motion adapted their research to both social causes and popular forms of entertainment, novelists explored the problem of the human form in terms of the pleasures and affective stimulations resulting from the experience of mobility. Whether on foot through the streets of Victorian London in Charles Dickens's Bleak House or by railway across the British countryside in Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, fictional bodies in motion extended the laws of thermodynamics and medical accounts of the nervous system to the reading practices of serial fiction. Similarly, late-Victorian works like Bram Stoker's Dracula and H. G. Wells's The Time Machine coordinated concerns about the limits of narrative realism within contemporary scientific and aesthetic debates about the seductive images of moving bodies in popular exhibitions and entertainments (panoramas, dioramas, cinema, and motion simulators). The project charts the course of the Victorian body in motion from the emergence of the city as a chaotic space of passing bodies, and the railway network as a radical form of carceral mobility, to the early cinema's adoption of the science of representation. Ultimately, I argue that the novel was an ideal medium for translating the diversity of ways in which bodies were compelled to continual mobility in the Victorian era. Moreover, attention to the Victorian body in motion's relation to the science of kinetics necessitates a reconsideration of canonical assumptions about the alienated industrial body of Victorian literature and culture that still informs much of our current scholarship on the consequences of modernity.

N2  - Simple models for disease transmission that include immigration of infective individuals and variable population size are constructed and analyzed. A model with a general contact rate for a disease that confers no immunity admits a unique endemic equilibrium that is globally stable. A model with mass action incidence for a disease in which infectives either die or recover with permanent immunity has the same qualitative behavior. This latter result is proved by reducing the system to an integro-differential equation. If mass action incidence is replaced by a general contact rate, then the same result is proved locally for a disease that causes fatalities. Threshold-like results are given, but in the presence of immigration of infectives there is no disease-free equilibrium. A considerable reduction of infectives is suggested by the incorporation of screening and quarantining of infectives in a model for HIV transmission in a prison system.

N2  - Methadone and buprenorphine are both efficacious treatments for opioid dependency, but they also have different pharmacological properties and clinical delivery methods that can affect their acceptability to patients. This study was intended to increase our knowledge of heroin-dependent individuals' perceptions of methadone vs. buprenorphine maintenance based on actual experiences with each. The study sample consists of heroin-dependent men at the Rikers Island jail in New York City who were voluntarily randomly assigned to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance in jail. Methadone patients were more likely to report feeling uncomfortable the first few days, having side/withdrawal effects during treatment, and being concerned about continued dependency on medication after release. In contrast, buprenorphine patients' main issue was the bitter taste. All of the buprenorphine patients stated that they would recommend the medication to others, with almost all preferring it to methadone. Ninety-three percent of buprenorphine vs. 44% of methadone patients intended to enroll in those respective treatments after release, with an added one-quarter of the methadone patients intending to enroll in buprenorphine instead. These results reinforce the importance of increasing access to buprenorphine treatment in the community for indigent heroin-dependent offenders.

N2  - “Varieties of warfare and war-related illnesses, mental and physical,” is the red thread that organizes this dissertation. My study compares and contrasts illness narratives (fiction and non-fiction) from modernism and the early twentieth century with texts of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries to better understand the psychologies of war trauma and techniques of narration from opposite sides of the twentieth century. In narratives about traditional and nontraditional warfare, I analyze how the social is deconstructed by the powerful mediators of illness and death and has to be reassembled in new forms of social organization. By tracing real connections across realms of existence normally separated by fields of study, I analyze the connections between medicine, literature, and events related to war and its history. The compelling strength of this dissertation is the comparative breadth of its perspective. In Chapter 1, I juxtapose Virginia Woolf’s modernist novel, Mrs. Dalloway, to Vera Brittain’s personal memoir, Testament of Youth , to compare fictional and non-fictional narratives about the rich lifeworlds of war-related illness and suffering of World War I. As a Latourian scholar, my focus is on the varieties of hybrid actor networks among soldiers, civilians, and health care providers amidst the reorganization of society for modern war, with its calamitous effects on mental health and physical well-being. Based on my findings, I argue that shell shock was a human rebellion against the unlivable situation of modern industrial warfare. While “rebellious”—as is important to note—shell shock was often an ineffective and self-destructive escape into illness. For some individuals, shell shock precipitated a profound personal transformation in their quest for a new state of health. Indeed, the rebellion of shell shock opposed the official master narrative of modern industrialized warfare, according to which the medical diagnoses of “war neuroses” were not neutral scientific diagnoses, but medical instruments of the military system to discipline and treat soldiers in order to return them to the front. In Chapter 2, I study early twenty-first century nonfictional anthropological representations of the experiences of war and PTSD, Fields of Combat: Understanding PTSD among Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan by Erin P. Finley and Breaking Ranks: Iraq Veterans Speak Out Against the War by Matthew Gutmann and Catherine Lutz, and one novel, Sparta, by Roxana Robinson. As a Latourian scholar, I distinguish the hybrid actor-networks that connect the two purist realms of medicine (objective; facts) and the self (subjective; the power of memory in the form of flashbacks). As I show, the contemporary diagnosis of PTSD (like the early twentieth century diagnoses of war neuroses) is founded on a rhetorical maneuver of purification that isolates mental trauma from the warfare that generates it; in short, PTSD is a disembodied, abstracted concept of the mind—an instance of a scientific artifact that Latour calls a “factish”—under the make-believe control of psychiatry. But real trauma produces hybrids connected to multiple sites that cannot be discounted as externalities. To counter the medical segregation of (mental) illness from politics, I trace the empirical connections in the actual “assemblages” between the psychological suffering of U.S. soldiers and their combat experiences to reconsider “PTSD” as a complex hybrid that proliferates in response to war and its structural violence. In Chapter 3, health and illness and the dying process are connected to nontraditional modes of warfare: In Blindness, when the population becomes white-blind, the government’s internment of the white-blind in medical quarantines makes war on the contagious people, not the microbe. In Death with Interruptions, the suspension of death is an allegory about the (mis)application of the critical care technology developed in war medicine to the civilian world in the end-of-life care of the terminally ill. Both novels are anti-realist fables that defamiliarize disease and death as fantastic conditions that are inaccessible to the medical/clinical gaze. In Blindness, I argue that rather than serving the purpose of protecting the public health, the location of the quarantine for the white-blind in an abandoned mental asylum unmasks the real carceral nature of medical quarantine as a distant successor to Foucault’s eighteenth century asylum for the insane. In Death with Interruptions, the deconstruction of traditional social life with the proliferation of the dying is narrated alongside the reinvention of the social among the dying and their families. In my allegorical reading, I argue there is a parallel between the novel’s fantastic suspension of death and the ontological condition of prolonged dying on the life-support machines of modern medicine that reveals the hubris of epistemological assumptions about the human capacity to control time and space through technological knowledge.

N2  - Australian prisons have been identified as a focus of the ongoing hepatitis C epidemic.
Harm minimisation is the major strategy directed to community‐based public health measures to control hepatitis C.
Harm‐minimisation strategies to protect inmates and workers are incompletely and inconsistently applied in Australian prisons.
Overseas experience has demonstrated that introducing injecting‐equipment exchange programs and professional tattoo parlours in prisons could at least partially reduce the risks of ongoing hepatitis C transmission, and would support prevention and treatment programs.
A two‐stage approach is suggested: firstly, implementing programs of proven effectiveness consistently across the eight Australian jurisdictions, and, secondly, expanding current initiatives in the light of international “best practice”.

N2  - Stamps and Piedmonte's Index of Work Satisfaction and Harris's Nurse Stress Index were completed by 287 registered nurses employed in state prison health care facilities in order to assess job satisfaction and job stress among correctional nurses. Correctional nurses' expectations about job satisfaction were influenced by pay and autonomy. This finding was consistent with studies of hospital nurses. Important sources of job satisfaction were professional status and interaction with employees. Analysis of differences between expectations and sources of job satisfaction may provide understanding of career benefits and sources of dissatisfaction. Time pressures and organizational support and involvement were sources of stress. Multivariate analyses showed an inverse relationship between stress and job satisfaction. Information about job satisfaction and work stress and their correlates may be used to develop strategies to improve the recruitment and retention of correctional nurses. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The male German cockroach performs a characteristic courtship behaviour upon contacting a sexually receptive female: he turns away from the female and raises his wings, thereby exposing tergal glands whose reservoirs contain phagostimulatory substances. The female then mounts the male and feeds upon these nuptial secretions; this behaviour places her in the appropriate precopulatory position. The contact sex pheromone on the cuticular surface of the female, responsible for eliciting courtship behaviour in males, consists of a blend of six components that share a common biosynthetic pathway. An excised female antenna can elicit the full courtship display in males. We found that antennae taken from either male or female nymphs of various ages also could elicit the full courtship response in adult males. We extracted lipids from the cuticular surface of nymphs and, guided by behavioural assays, we fractionated the extracts using various chromatography procedures, including flash (column) chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. Mass spectrometry analysis of behaviourally active fractions revealed two classes of courtship-eliciting compounds: all nymphs possessed a novel, still unidentified compound that elicited courtship in adult males. In addition, in last-instar females, we isolated four of the six adult female-specific contact sex pheromone components, consistent with differentiation of the sexes at this stage, and the onset of sexual maturation of the pheromone biosynthetic machinery. Our results support the interpretation that nymphs engage in sexual mimicry to gain access to male-produced nuptial tergal secretions that are exposed and can be secured only during courtship.

N2  - Background:  Youth involved with juvenile courts often suffer from mental health difficulties and disorders, and these mental health disorders have often been a factor leading to the youth’s delinquent behaviours and activities.
Method:  The present study of a sample population (N = 341), randomly drawn from one urban US county’s juvenile court delinquent population, investigated which specific mental health disorders predicted detention for committing a personal crime.
Results:  Youth with attention‐deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder diagnoses were significantly less likely to commit personal crimes and experience subsequent detention, while youth with bipolar diagnoses were significantly more likely.
Conclusion:  Co‐ordinated youth policy efforts leading to early identification and treatment of bipolar disorder symptoms may be necessary.

N2  - The prevalence of childhood maltreatment and the magnitude of the association of maltreatment with internalizing mental health symptoms were examined in 398 incarcerated youth. The prevalence of abuse greatly exceeded general population rates. The proportion of variance in mental health symptoms accounted for by maltreatment was small but developmentally significant. Sexual abuse is a markedly stronger predictor of internalizing mental health problems in incarcerated youth than physical abuse. Consistent with a biopsychological model of trauma, dissociation at the time of sexual abuse was the strongest nondemographic predictor of mental health symptoms. Physical abuse was associated with more internalizing mental health problems for children from families with mental health problems and families with lower socioeconomic status. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

N2  - This exploratory study examined the extent to which substance use and criminality influence perceptions of social support. A stratified random sample of 100 incarcerated women in one Kentucky prison participated in face-to-face interviews. Overall, findings indicate that perceptions of social support significantly and negatively correlated with women's severity of substance use and criminal involvement. In addition, the breadth of a respondent's social network was negatively related to the age of first incarceration and to the severity of alcohol and drug use. Findings from this study suggest there is a relationship between severity of substance use, criminality, and perceptions of social support. Implications for substance use research and practice are discussed.

N2  - Background: There are no systematic surveys of the UK prison population, but data from several sources suggest that a significant number of prisoners might have limitations in their speech, language and communication abilities.
Aim: To examine the hypothesis that compared with the general population, a significantly larger number of the prison population has speech, language and communication difficulties.
Methods & Procedures: A survey of 10% of the young offenders within one young offender's institution was conducted. Tests of naming, picture description, grammatical competency and comprehension were used.
Outcomes & Results: Forty-three per cent of participants scored at a level significantly lower than the limits acceptable for their age on the Boston Naming Test; 73% scored significantly below the acceptable limits for their age on grammatical competency; 23% scored significantly below the acceptable limits for their age on language comprehension; 47% of participants received more than one rating of moderate impairment on picture description.
Conclusion: It was confirmed that high levels of speech, language and communication difficulties are found among the young offender population. The implications for the management of young offenders, the limitations of the study and indications for further research are discussed.

N2  - While telepsychiatry - the use of telecommunication technologies to deliver mental health services from a distance - ought to have particular applicability to forensic work, little is known about its effectiveness in such settings. We reviewed the literature on the forensic applications of telepsychiatry, aiming to provide a summary and determine its effectiveness. We searched several relevant databases for reports published between 1998 and 2006 of forensic applications of telepsychiatry. The existing literature provides some preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of telepsychiatry in the forensic arena. However, as there are some serious methodological limitations such as lack of control groups, small sample sizes, and limited outcome evaluation, its utility can only be regarded as preliminary. Telepsychiatry is a feasible mode of health care delivery in areas relevant to the practice of forensic psychiatry. Further research is needed to determine its effectiveness and identify barriers to its use among forensic psychiatrists.

N2  - Objectives: We sought to describe disparities and trends in tuberculosis (TB) risk factors and treatment outcomes between correctional inmate and noninmate populations.
Methods: We analyzed data reported to the national TB surveillance system from 1993 through 2003. We compared characteristics between inmate and non-inmate men aged 15–64 years.
Results: Of the 210976 total US TB cases, 3.8% (7820) were reported from correctional systems. Federal and state prison case rates were 29.4 and 24.2 cases per 100000 inmates, respectively, which were considerably higher than those in the noninmate population (6.7 per 100000 people). Inmates with TB were more likely to have at least 1 TB risk factor compared with noninmates (60.1% vs 42.0%, respectively) and to receive directly observed therapy (65.0% vs 41.0%, respectively); however, they were less likely to complete treatment (76.8% vs 89.4%, respectively). Among inmates, 58.9% completed treatment within 12 months compared with 73.2% of noninmates.
Conclusions: Tuberculosis case rates in prison systems remain higher than in the general population. Inmates with TB are less likely than noninmates to complete treatment.

N2  - Little is known about experiences of sexual coercion among prisoners prior to incarceration. Prisoner populations are routinely excluded from national surveys of sexual health which also tend to under-represent marginalized groups. We surveyed 2351 randomly selected men and women, aged 18–64 years, in New South Wales and Queensland prisons who participated in a computer-assisted telephone interview. Around 60% of women and 14% of men self-reported having been sexually coerced prior to incarceration, with 60% of these experiences occurring before the age of 16 years. Factors independently associated with a self-reported history of sexual coercion were: homosexual and bisexual identity, being unable to work, separated marital status, higher level of education (among women), having been paid for sex, a past sexually transmissible infection (among men), drug use (among women) and a history of mental health problems. Prior sexual coercion was associated with unwanted sexual contact and physical assault while in prison. The high prevalence of sexual coercion reported by prisoners and its association with a range of factors indicates a need for a greater acknowledgement of the potential consequences of this within the criminal justice system. This could entail providing counselling and support services within the correctional setting.

N2  - PTSD symptoms have been widely reported within the research literature following the perpetration of violent crime. This case study illustrates the application of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) within a prison environment using a psychological model of PTSD. The individual had endured a number of traumatic events and was experiencing symptoms related to memories of his index offence of murder. Following completion of therapy, symptoms were significantly decreased, and his functioning and level of distress was much improved. Implications are that offence related PTSD can be treated with CBT in a prison, and that thorough assessment identifying avoidance needs to be completed before offending behaviour programmes are targeted to decrease the risk of re-offending.

N2  - Abstract Objective: To define the prevalence of mental disorder and need for psychiatric treatment in new remand prisoners and to determine to what extent these are recognised and addressed in prison. Design: Study of consecutive male remand prisoners at reception using a semistructured psychiatric interview. Setting: Large remand prison for men (HMP Durham). Subjects: 569 men aged 21 years and over on remand, awaiting trial. Main outcome measures—Prevalence of mental disorder at reception, prisoners need for psychiatric treatment, identification of mental disorder by prison reception screening, and numbers placed appropriately in the prison hospital. Results: 148 (26%) men had one or more current mental disorders (excluding substance misuse) including 24 who were acutely psychotic. The prison reception screening identified 34 of the men with mental disorder and six of those with acute psychosis. 168 men required psychiatric treatment, 50 of whom required urgent intervention; 16 required immediate transfer to psychiatric hospital. Of these 50, 17 were placed on the hospital wing because of mental disorder recognised at prison screening. Conclusion: Not only is the prevalence of mental disorder, in particular severe mental illness, high in this population, but the numbers identified at reception are low and subsequent management in prison is poor. Key messages In this study in Durham prison 26% had a serious mental disorder Only about a quarter of the mentally disordered patients were recognised by the prison doctor and hospital officer Only two fifths of patients who required urgent psychiatric treatment were put into the prison hospital Improved diagnosis of psychiatric illness in prison will greatly increase the pressure on psychiatric beds

N2  - Objectives. We determined jail inmates’ knowledge of cancer screening tests, their frequency of screening, and their willingness to undergo screening in jail in order to assess preventive health services for jail inmates.
Methods. We performed a cross-sectional interview survey of random samples of county jail inmates (n=133).
Results. Approximately half (53%) the participants were African American, 17% were White, 11% were Latino, and 9% reported multiple ethnicities. Among women aged 18 years and older, 90% had had a Papanicolaou (Pap) test within 3 years, and 94% were willing to be screened in jail. Having ever had a Pap test while incarcerated was significantly associated with being up to date on cervical cancer screening. For women aged 40 years and older, 41% reported having had a mammogram within 2 years, and 88% were willing to have one. Among men (n=51) and women (n=4) aged 50 years and older, 25% had knowledge of colon cancer screening, 31% were up to date, and 69% were willing to be screened. Increased knowledge about colon cancer screening was significantly associated with being White and having insurance. Jail inmates, particularly African Americans, had significantly lower frequency of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy than the general population.
Conclusions. Jail could be an appropriate venue in which to provide cancer screening for a high-risk population. Inmates were receptive to jail-based screening.

N2  - Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are a public health issue in prison. As inmates are eventually released, it is also a community concern. There are very few data on the entire spectrum of STDs, particularly condyloma among prisoners. To determine the prevalence of all STDs: infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, syphilis, and condyloma among entering inmates. A cross-sectional study was conducted in France from November 2000 to June 2003. Male adults entering a prison remand center in Caen had a medical consultation and physical examination including external genital organs and perianal area for condyloma and herpes infection, a urethral swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea detection, and a blood sample for HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis serology. Five hundred and ninety-seven inmates agreed to participate in the study. Sixteen percent had at least one STD: 4.0% had condyloma, 4.0% chlamydia infection, and 4.9% were positive for HCV antibodies. Two had early syphilis and 1 had acute HBV, but no HIV infection, neither genital herpes nor gonorrhea. The analysis of the STD risk behaviors did not show any difference between the infected and uninfected participants, except that HCV-positive participants were more likely to be intravenous drug users. Results suggest that a systematic screening of all STDs should be at least proposed to every entering inmate since no demographic or sexual characteristics are consistently associated with STDs.

N2  - This study examines whether, in a male prison, the subjective experience of crowding increases the likelihood that events are perceived as aggressive in nature, and whether the protagonists involved are viewed as more hostile, malevolent, and aggressive. In addition, this paper also examines the possible mediating effects of stress, arousal, and psychological well‐being on two hypothesised relationships. First, these mediating factors are examined for the link between individuals' personal space preferences and their perceived level of crowding. Second, these factors are examined for the link between perceived crowding and interpretations of an aggressive event. Such associations may help to explain why crowding and aggression are linked within a social interactionist perspective. The results confirmed previous findings that crowding is linked to increases in arousal and stress, and a reduction in psychological well‐being. This study also found, however, that those inmates who experienced crowding were also more likely to interpret behaviour as aggressive and violent. This relationship was not mediated by arousal, stress, or psychological well‐being. However, these factors were found to partially operate in the relationship between personal space preferences and the experience of subjective crowding. The implications of this study for social interactionist explanations of the link between crowding and prison violence are offered. Aggr. Behav. 30:273–283, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

N2  - Objective:  To determine the past year prevalence of mental disorders of 15–17‐year‐old adolescent remand prisoners in east Denmark.
Method:  One hundred 15–17‐year‐old boys from east Denmark consecutively remanded during 1 year were interviewed with diagnostic instruments to obtain ICD‐10 diagnoses. All were screened in The Danish Psychiatric Case Register and The Danish Criminal Register.
Results:  Past year prevalence of ‘any mental disorder’ was 69%, substance use disorders 41%. Two per cent had schizophrenia and 2% schizotypal disorder. Thirty‐six per cent had ‘probable personality disorder’. Conduct disorder was found in 31% and 1% had a hyperkinetic disorder. Ten per cent had previous registered psychiatric contact.
Conclusion:  The prevalence of mental disorders was found substantially higher compared with literature of population‐based samples. With an association between mental disorders and violence, early detection and treatment of mental disorders in adolescent delinquents is of importance in the prevention of violence.

N2  - Background n-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects including modulation of pro-inflammatory cascade mediators and cytokine elaboration (i.e., TNF-α, IL-10 and PGE2 ) in many cell lines. However, mechanisms of anti-proliferative effects have not been clearly defined. Materials and methods MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells were treated either with n-3FA (treatment), media (control), or n-6FA (control) for all experiments. Cellular proliferation was evaluated with WST-1 reagent. Cells were stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry for cell-cycle arrest, which was further analyzed by cdc2 expression. Membrane and media lipid concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Apoptosis was evaluated by AnnexinV-FITC flow cytometry and reconfirmed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and Bcl -2 expression. Results Propidium iodide flow cytometry of MIA PaCa-2 dosed with n-3FA showed a decrease in cells in G1 phase (11–17%) and an increase cells in G2 phase (7–13%) from controls. cdc2 expression was also decreased at 24 h compared to controls. Annexin-V staining of n-3FA-treated cells demonstrated time-dependent increased apoptosis and PARP cleavage was present only in the n-3FA treatment group. Phospho-Bcl -2 was also decreased in the n-3FA-treated cells compared to controls. Conclusions Co-incubation of MIA PaCa-2 cells with n-3FA results in both dose- and time-dependent cell-cycle arrest. Cells also progress to cell death via apoptosis. These data support the potential applicability for n-3FA as an antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic strategy.

N2  - Adolescent offenders have high levels of mental health problems leading to poor short-term and long-term outcomes. However, many problems still go undetected despite recent screening initiatives, and little is known about the factors affecting recognition of their problems. A random sample of 115 detained boys was interviewed following reception into custody to compare the differences between those whose problems were recognised at prison screening and those whose problems were missed. Almost half of the boys with mental health problems were missed at reception screening; internalising problems such as depression were more likely to be missed. Boys who used behavioural coping strategies or who subjectively rated themselves as having problems were more likely to be recognised. Further improvement is needed in screening, and greater attention should be given to internalising disorders and young people's subjective rating of health status.

N2  - Relationships between traumatic life events and suicide risk were studied in two samples of jail inmates with a low (N = 216) and a high (N = 51) suicide risk. Although nonsuicidal inmates reported a high prevalence of traumatic life events, suicidal inmates reported even higher prevalence rates. Suicidal inmates reported more episodes of sexual abuse, physical maltreatment, emotional maltreatment, abandonment, and suicide attempts by significant others. They also had experienced more traumatic life events during childhood, later life, and detention. It is concluded that traumatic life events are associated with suicide risk and that such an association remains in a population with a high prevalence of traumatic life events. It is also concluded that suicide risk is dependent of the type of life event, the timing of the event, and the type of persons involved in the event.

N2  - Objective. We estimated the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection among newly arriving inmates at 6 California prisons.
Methods. In this cross-sectional study in 1999, urine specimens collected from 698 men aged 18 to 25 years and 572 women aged 18 years or older were tested at intake for C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae using ligase chain reaction. An analysis of demographic and arrest-related correlates of C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae infection was performed.
Results. The overall C trachomatis prevalence was 9.9% (95% CI=7.8%, 12.3%) among men aged 18 to 25 years, 8.9% (95% CI = 2.9%, 22.1%) among women aged 18 to 25 years, and 3.3% (95% CI=2.0%, 5.1%) among women overall. Three N gonorrhoeae cases were detected with an overall prevalence of 0.24% (95% CI=0.05%, 0.69%).
Conclusions. The prevalence of C trachomatis infection at entry to California prisons, especially among young female and male inmates, was high, which supports routine screening at entry into prison. In addition, screening in a jail setting where most detainees are incarcerated before entry into the prison setting may provide an excellent earlier opportunity to identify these infections and treat disease to prevent complications and burden of infection in this high-risk population.

N2  - Prison-based research has been limited due to concern that prisoners may represent a vulnerable population secondary to possible coercion and limited capacity for voluntary informed consent. This study was designed to assess decisional capacity and susceptibility to coercion in prison research subjects. Subjects were 30 mentally ill prisoners and 30 healthy controls. The groups were compared on ability to provide informed consent to a hypothetical drug trial, susceptibility to possible coercion, neuropsychological functioning, and psychiatric symptoms. Results indicated that all controls and all but one of the prisoners demonstrated adequate capacity to consent to the hypothetical drug trial. However, when decisional capacity was measured quantitatively, prisoners performed significantly worse regarding two aspects of this ability. Regarding possible coercion, prisoners’ main reasons for participating in research included avoiding boredom, meeting someone new, appearing cooperative in hopes of being treated better, and helping society. Neuropsychological functioning was strongly positively correlated with decisional capacity and negatively correlated with susceptibility to possible coercion, whereas psychiatric symptoms were only weakly correlated with these variables. In conclusion, a very high percentage of particularly vulnerable, mentally ill prisoners demonstrated adequate capacity to consent to research. Lower scores on a quantitative measure of decisional capacity suggest that extra care should be taken during the consent process when working with these subjects. The reasons prisoners gave for participating in our research indicated that the prison setting may have influenced their decision to participate, but that they were not actually coerced into doing so. Despite serious past incidents, ethicists will need to consider the possibility that prisoners have become an overprotected population.

N2  - The cross-instrument validity of the SCID-II screen and the SCID-II structured clinical interview was examined in a sub-sample of 496 male and female prisoners from a national survey in England and Wales. Participants completed the SCID-II screen and were interviewed two weeks later by clinicians using the SCID-II interview. The screen was adjusted on the basis of interview results. Diagnostic categories were compared before and after adjustment of the screen. Diagnostic cut-off adjustments to the screen resulted in moderate agreement between instruments for categorical and dimensional evaluations. The screen retained good internal consistency with improved discrimination between personality disorders and clinical syndromes following adjustment. The SCID-II screen is a valid self-report instrument for diagnosing personality disorders. It may be preferable for prison populations but is not a substitute for a structured clinical interview.

N2  - This is thesis is about the ways that prisoners and staff in a category B local prison used music to manage the various pains and insecurities that characterise the experience of imprisonment in late modernity. Based on nine months of quasi-ethnographic study, the thesis explores the way in which music is constituted in the daily life of the prison by investigating the situated practices of prisoners and staff. This is an exploratory study which seeks to account for the lack of research exploring the topic of music within this area of prison life. Existing research has tended to focus on the therapeutic and rehabilitative capabilities of music in carceral settings and has thus overlooked the social and cultural dimensions of music in the daily life. Drawing on the work of DeNora (2000, 2013) this thesis examines how music intersects with various aspects of daily life including its sensory, affective, and institutional dimensions, in addition to the social and cultural life of the prison. In conditions of profound and persistent uncertainty which characterise local prisons, this thesis highlights the ways that music is used to create forms of stability (and contrast) across various dimensions of daily life.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the issues encountered during the implementation of an indoor smoking ban in prison and its effects on self-reported tobacco use, perceived exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) and perceived health status of inmates in Quebec's provincial correctional facilities. Methods: Quantitative data were obtained from 113 inmates in three provincial correctional facilities in the province of Quebec, Canada. Qualitative data were obtained from 52 inmates and 27 staff members. Participants were recruited through a self-selection process. Particular efforts were made to enrol proportions of men, women, smokers and non-smokers similar to those generally found among correctional populations. Results: Despite the indoor smoking ban, 93% of inmates who declared themselves smokers reported using tobacco products inside the correctional facilities and 48% did not report any reduction in their tobacco use. Only 46% of smokers declared having been caught smoking inside the facility, and more than half of them (58%) reported no disciplinary consequences to their smoking. A majority of inmates incarcerated before the implementation of the ban (66%) did not perceive a reduction of their exposure to SHS following the indoor ban. Enforcement issues were encountered during the implementation of the indoor ban, notably because of the amendment made to the original regulation (total smoking ban) and tolerance from smokers in the staff towards indoor smoking. They were also related to perceptions that banning indoor smoking is complex and poses management problems. Conclusion: This study's findings emphasize the importance of considering organizational and environmental factors when planning the implementation of an indoor smoking ban in correctional facilities. Objectifs : Décrire les problèmes rencontrés suite à l'implantation d'une réglementation interdisant de fumer à l'intérieur des prisons, ainsi que les effets de cette réglementation sur l'usage du tabac, l'exposition perçue à la fumée de tabac ambiante et l'état de santé perçu chez des détenus incarcérés en établissement de détention provincial au Québec. Méthode : Des données quantitatives ont été recueillies auprès de 113 détenus dans trois établissements de détention provinciaux situés dans la province de Québec. Des données qualitatives ont été obtenues auprès de 52 détenus et 27 membres du personnel. Les participants ont été recrutés selon un processus d'autosélection, en visant à obtenir des proportions d'hommes, de femmes, de fumeurs et de non-fumeurs similaires à celles généralement retrouvées au sein des établissements de détention. Résultats : En dépit de l'interdiction de fumer, 93 % des détenus se déclarant fumeurs ont affirmé utiliser des produits du tabac à l'intérieur des établissements de détention, et 48 % ont dit ne pas avoir réduit leur consommation de tabac. Seulement 46 % des détenus fumeurs interrogés ont déclaré avoir été appréhendés par un agent correctionnel lorsqu'ils fumaient à l'intérieur de l'établissement. Parmi ces derniers, plus de la moitié (58 %) n'ont pas subi de conséquences disciplinaires. Une majorité des détenus incarcérés avant l'implantation de l'interdiction de fumer (66 %) n'ont pas perçu de réduction de l'exposition à la fumée de tabac ambiante suite à l'entrée en vigueur de la réglementation. Des problèmes d'application ont été rencontrés au cours de la période d'implantation de la réglementation, notamment en raison d'une modification à la réglementation initiale (laquelle prévoyait une interdiction totale de fumer en milieu correctionnel) et de la tolérance de membres du personnel fumeurs vis-à-vis l'usage du tabac à l'intérieur des établissements. Ces problèmes étaient également reliés à la perception que l'interdiction de l'usage du tabac à l'intérieur des établissements de détention est une procédure complexe qui engendre des problèmes de gestion. Conclusion : Les résultats de cette étude soulignent l'importance de considérer les facteurs organisationnels et environnementaux dans la planification de l'implantation d'une réglementation interdisant l'usage du tabac à l'intérieur des établissements de détention.

N2  - This project refigures the histories of yellow fever, cholera, and typhus through the rubric of intimacy, defined as a value-neutral condition of physical and sensory proximity that can acquire a positive or negative valence based on context. It considers how disease-specific symptoms, epidemiological theories, and treatments of disease have material and intimate impacts on the cultures and societies that survive. Intimate care practices catalyzed knowledge production, feeding into nosological theories of disease, but they also changed the ways that people understood the body, and themselves as patients and physicians. Philadelphia’s historic epidemics catalyzed the development of a clinical brand of intimate information gathering that blurred the lines between what historians have traditionally viewed as distinctly medical and distinctly carceral institutions. Twenty-first-century compliance with doctors’ orders was built on the shaky foundation of coerced acquiescence, much of which took place during nineteenth-century disease epidemics in institutions like Philadelphia’s Lazaretto, and its almshouses, hospitals, and prisons. Institutional physicians bolstered professional credibility through the performance of intimate care. Understanding the embodied experience of disease is especially important for historians of medicine. Paying careful attention to archival mentions of embodied experiences—pain, pleasure, smell, touch, disgust—allows for a more thorough understanding of the lived experiences of historical actors. This research highlights the interconnectedness of epidemic diseases with each other and the professional identity of physicians, as well as the closely intertwined relationship between physical and moral health—and between personal and communal health—in the late-eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century medical imagination.

N2  - Objectives: We examined the relationship between substance use and sexual HIV-risk behaviors among young men who have been incarcerated, in order to understand how HIV risks develop for this vulnerable population. Methods: A sample of 552 young men in a New York City jail was interviewed at the time of incarceration. Bivariate analyses were performed to examine demographic and sexual HIV-risk behavior differences between men with and without recent alcohol and marijuana use. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between alcohol and marijuana use and sexual HIV-risk behaviors in the 90 days prior to incarceration. Results: Respondents were predominantly Black (57%) or Latino (37%), with a mean age of 17.4 years. The most common substances used were marijuana (82%) and alcohol (65%). Alcohol use prior to incarceration was significantly associated with having three or more sexual partners in the same time period (OR = 2.40, p < .001), as well as with having unprotected sex with a long-term partner (OR = 1.72, p < .01). Marijuana use was significantly associated with having multiple sex partners (OR = 1.55, p < .01). Heavy alcohol and marijuana use did not result in an increased likelihood of sexual HIV-risk behaviors. Conclusions: High rates of substance use and unprotected sex may have unintended health consequences for incarcerated young men. Severity of substance use is not a significant predictor of risk behaviors, suggesting the importance of contextual and social factors. Results highlight the need for HIV prevention efforts for this population that take into account contextual and social factors.

N2  - The article describes men's perceptions of and experience with substance use and sexual behavior during incarceration. Grounded theory content analyses were performed on qualitative interviews conducted with 80 men, aged 18 to 29, in four U.S. states. Participants believed that drugs were easily available in prison. Half reported using substances, primarily marijuana or alcohol, while incarcerated. Key themes included the role of correctional personnel in the flow of substances in prison and the economic significance of substance trafficking. With regard to sexual behavior, most men acknowledged that it occurred but were hesitant to talk in-depth about it. There was a strong belief in "don't look, don't tell," and sex in prison was often associated with homosexual behavior or identity. Sex during incarceration was reported by 12 men, mostly with female partners. Participants were pessimistic about HIV/STD/hepatitis prevention efforts inside correctional facilities. These findings highlight the need for risk reduction programs for incarcerated men.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To describe injection drug use among inmates, and to identify correlates of drug injection while incarcerated.
Design  Cross‐sectional survey.
Setting  Six provincial correctional centres in Ontario, Canada.
Participants  Face‐to‐face interviews were conducted with a random sample of 439 adult males and 158 females.
Measurements  Inmates were asked about drug use in their lifetime, outside the year prior to their current incarceration, and while incarcerated in the past year. Among the 32% (189 / 597) with a prior history of drug injection, independent correlates of injection while incarcerated in the past year were identified using multiple logistic regression.
Findings  Among all inmates while incarcerated in the past year, 45% (269 /597) used drugs and 19% (113 / 596) used non‐cannabis drugs. Among those with a prior history of injecting, 11% (20 / 189) injected while incarcerated in the past year. Rates of injection with used needles were the same pre‐incarceration as they were while incarcerated (32%). Independent correlates of drug injection while incarcerated were injection of heroin (OR = 6.4) or other opiates (OR = 7.9) and not injected with used needles (OR = 0.20) outside in the year prior to incarceration, and ever being incarcerated in a federal prison (OR = 5.3).
Conclusions  The possibility of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C (HCV) or other blood‐borne diseases exists in Ontario correctional centres. In this setting, drug injection while incarcerated is primarily related to opiate use prior to incarceration. The correlation between injecting and extensive incarceration history suggests missed opportunities to improve inmates’ health.

N2  - This study explored the relationship between ethnic identity and Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections among detained African American female adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 123 African American female adolescents within eight detention facilities in Georgia. Using audio-computer assisted self-interviewing technology, data were collected on demographics, ethnic identity, laboratory-confirmed Chlamydia and Gonorrhea, and other known correlates for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as socioeconomic status, parental monitoring, and risky sexual behaviors. Rates of Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing yielded incidence rates of 22.6% and 4.3%, respectively. Findings indicated that, controlling for STI correlates, participants who indicated high ethnic identity were 4.3 times more likely to test positive for an STI compared to those scoring low on the measure of ethnic identity.

N2  - In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations to screen all inmates with a history of injection drug use or other risk factors for hepatitis C. We compared self-reported risk factors for hepatitis C with serostatus from inmates in the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Of the male inmates who were hepatitis C positive, 66% did not report injection drug use. Risk-based testing underestimates the hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence in correctional settings and limits the opportunity to diagnose and prevent hepatitis C infection.

N2  - Prison inmates with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be difficult to treat because of the complexity and intrusiveness of many combination antiretroviral therapy regimens. NZTA4007, a 24-week open-label, single-arm clinical trial involving 108 antiretroviral therapy-naive, incarcerated, HIV-infected persons, was conducted to evaluate a compact regimen (4 tablets per day) consisting of 1 lamivudine-zidovudine (150 mg/300 mg) combination tablet (COM) and one 300-mg abacavir tablet administered twice daily under directly observed treatment conditions. In the intent-to-treat observed analysis, the plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level remained at <400 copies/mL in 85% of the patients and at <50 copies/mL in 75% of the patients. Median change from baseline was -2.41 log10 copies/mL for the HIV-1 RNA level and +111 cells/mm3 for the CD4 cell count. The overall adherence to prescribed doses was 94% for patients who remained enrolled in the study. COM-abacavir given twice daily was generally well tolerated, and adverse events prompted only 4 patients to withdraw from the study.

N2  - The purpose of this case-control study was to elucidate the relative proportions of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) and amphetamine-induced disorder (AID) in a group of adolescents with the use of methamphetamine (MAMP) and to examine the risks for psychiatric comorbidity and sex for MAMP use. Psychiatric comorbidity in the preceding year was determined for 200 adolescent MAMP users and 400 drug-free control subjects by diagnostic interview using the Kiddie epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The proportions of AUD and AID were calculated, and the association between psychiatric comorbidity, sex, and MAMP use was assessed. The results revealed that among the MAMP users, 65 subjects (32.5%) had AUD, whereas 19 (9.5%) had AID. Early use of MAMP use was seen in AUD, whereas high-frequency MAMP use was associated with the occurrence of AID. Alcohol, nicotine, and betel nut use disorders were more prevalent in MAMP users for both sexes. By applying conditional logistic regression analysis, it was demonstrated that MAMP use was associated with conduct disorder in males, whereas in females, it was associated with conduct disorder and adjustment disorder. The results indicated that age of first use and subsequent frequency of MAMP use appeared to be associated with the development of amphetamine-related disorders. Sex differences in the association between psychiatric comorbidity and MAMP use were demonstrated. These factors have to be taken into consideration when intervening for adolescent MAMP use.

N2  - We assessed feasibility and outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in male correctional inmates in British Columbia, Canada. We reviewed the medical charts of 114 treated inmates; 80 had complete data for treatment outcome. Approximately 4 of 5 inmates completed treatment (78.8%); 66.3% achieved sustained virological response. Those who completed treatment, those with injection drug use as a risk factor, and those with genotypes 2 and 3 were significantly more likely to achieve sustained virological response. HCV treatment in correctional inmates is feasible and effective.

N2  - Twenty-five percent of the US HIV-infected population is released from a prison or jail each year. As the extent of risky sexual behaviours after prison release is largely unknown, we interviewed a cohort (n = 64) of HIV-infected, recently released (mean 45 days, SD 28) prisoners about their current sexual risk behaviours. Almost half (47%, n = 64) of the released prisoners reported sexual activity after release, mostly with regular partners. Although 26% (n = 27) reported engaging in unprotected sexual activity with their regular partners, none (n = 4) reported unprotected sex with their non-regular partners. Furthermore, 33% percent (n = 15) of the releasees with regular partners reported engaging in unprotected sex with HIV-seronegative partners. These results suggest that regular partners of HIV-infected prison releasees are at risk of acquiring HIV infection, and secondary risk-reduction strategies are needed for HIV-infected prison releasees.

N2  - This thesis examines the previously unacknowledged literary tradition of women's prison zines in the United States. Prison zines are short collections of art and literature that circulate in the prison where they are produced, in other penal facilities in America, and even among the general public. This thesis is grounded in an analysis of over fifty different publications and nearly 1000 individual issues that I have gathered over the course of my PhD through original archival research across the United States. I plot the entire women's prison zine literary tradition from the earliest publication in 1933 through to the present day in an effort to identify shifts in content, readership and production. Using genre to define my approach, I examine how prison zines offer new insights into literary traditions that have otherwise excluded them, arguing that the prison is a unique environment for creative production that leads to a distinctive and compelling sub-genre of American literature. I examine how prison zines dismantle and adapt traditional women's magazines, contribute to the American protest literature tradition, generate collective autobiography, and reconfigure feminist print culture in order to more accurately voice the experiences and identities of women behind bars. I identify three defining features of prison zines-community, confinement aesthetic and resistance-arguing that they are products of the unique carceral environment in which zines are produced: an environment rooted in punishment and isolation. This form of analysis demonstrates how incarcerated women use print to establish networks and sustain communities; voice marginalised experiences and opinions; educate each other and the general public; and communicate, create, and resist. In doing so, this thesis reflects the interdisciplinarity and growing diversification of the field of American Studies and the influence on it of gender, race, and print culture studies. It considers the historical contexts that create the genre, the literary and cultural techniques that define it, and articulates the marginalized voices that are continuously omitted from the canon.

N2  - This thesis examines convict transportation from the Madras Presidency to penal colonies across the Indian Ocean, particularly the Straits Settlements, between 1789 and 1860. It discusses the transportation of Indian convicts across the Indian Ocean as a carceral network, understanding it as a set of connections and interactions across the Indian Ocean, and alongside the concept of an ‘Indian Ocean world’. The study begins by examining how transportation was understood by the colonial authorities in Madras and around the Indian Ocean, how transportation was imposed in Madras in practice and how transportation was experienced by those transported from Madras. One of its central aims is to examine the role of transportation in expanding East India Company (EIC) control in India and across the Indian Ocean. Through the East India Company’s prisons and its coercive networks that extended across the Indian Ocean, convicts were orientated to prison discipline and rules. Their lives and experiences from the moment of their conviction to their transfer to zillah prisons and their journey from zillah prisons to Chingleput prison and finally to the penal colonies of the Straits Settlements was a long and continuous process of orientation to prison discipline and rules. Examining the transportation of convicts from the Madras Presidency also provides a new perspective on the global networks of migration during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries comprised of indentured labourers and migrants from South India. By focusing on the Madras Presidency, this research explores the continuities and divergences across the Indian Ocean world that began with convict transportation across the Indian Ocean in the late eighteenth century.

N2  - The Offender Rehabilitation Act (ORA) 2014 extended post-release supervision to the short sentence population, a cohort who have historically been neglected in penal discourse and were introduced as a part of the Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) reforms. The purpose of this thesis is to explore how resettlement is enacted by practitioners and experienced by individuals serving short sentences. This empirical research was undertaken in one case study area in England and Wales. The experiences of 35 practitioners and service users were captured, in order to gain a rich qualitative perspective of the newly re-designated resettlement prison; the experiences of transitioning through-the-gate into the community; post-sentence supervision; service user perspectives of navigating resettlement; and practitioner perspectives of on the ground practice in the Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC). Findings from this research reveal a dissonance between the aims and ambitions of TR and the reality on the ground. This dissonance is caused by a set of inter-connected institutional, temporal and political-economic barriers. Practitioners operating at the micro-level lacked the agency to overcome these barriers. This left TR as the latest iteration of resettlement policy that has failed to provide continuity between prison and probation. In addition, TR has also entailed broader consequences, eroding the value base of probation practice, curtailing innovation and reducing the relational aspects of supervision to a 'treadmill' of relentless yet generic practice. Drawing on the theoretical constructs of the pains of imprisonment, responsibilisation, recovery/resettlement capital and net widening, this thesis argues that the failures to provide resettlement support led to practitioners adopting a responsibilisation strategy that pushes responsibility for resettlement towards other agencies and service users. This leaves service users to feel invisible and insignificant - distinct pains of the short sentence. Although the ORA 2014 was intended as a safety net for this population, it has instead caught individuals up in a complex 'resettlement net' of carceral control in the community.

N2  - This thesis charts the history and evolution of a mass-incarcerating regime of detention, disappearance and torture in Egypt between 1948 and 1981. In seeking to explain Egypt's carceral present, it traces, for the first time, the history of the Egyptian Mu'taqal [political prison], from its emergence as a powerful instrument of government in the aftermath of the Second World War, through to its entrenchment as a mainstay of post-colonial governance by the newly independent state and by successive regimes thereafter. Drawing on archival sources in Cairo, London, Aix-en-Provence and Amsterdam, organisational and party records, prisoners' memoirs and testimonies, literary and visual cultural production, and over 250 interviews with members of various communist and Islamist organisations, in Egypt and in exile, it tells the history of the Mu'taqal from the perspective of its chief protagonists, the political prisoners themselves. The thesis critically examines the operation of power and resistance in contestations over the gendered identities of prisoners. Interrogating the idea that confinement and torture in authoritarian regimes reflect the workings of an irrational or brutish state, it illustrates that power contestation in the Mu'taqal extended far beyond the limited and clichéd repertory of torture and hunger-strikes. Rather, emergent public discourses on respectability, ideals of 'real manhood', and the tenets of the nuclear family as the basis of the nascent Egyptian nation, were all distilled by the Mu'taqal into a panoply of gendered disciplinary discourses and acts which sought to deny its inhabitants the label, recognition and identity of 'political prisoner'. The thesis argues that the state's subjection and subjugation of incarcerated dissidents fundamentally relied on the state's ability to debase mu'taqalin's gender identities, and that gender served as the primary terrain on which political prisoners' sought to assert their autonomy and (re)constitute themselves as agents in the historical process.

N2  - For women in the United States, the fight against AIDS has for the past forty years been a fight for autonomy, equality, and rights. During this period, activists have not only had to deal with the health crisis of the AIDS epidemic, but have had to battle with the US government and the pharmaceutical industry over the question of who is deserving, who is responsible, and who counts in the epidemic. These questions were particularly important in the 1980s, a decade during which ideas about who deserved welfare and support were at the top of the political agenda. Since then, the treatment environment has changed, but women's struggle to make themselves count as human beings, free from prescriptions about their bodies and lives, has continued to drive their activism in the twenty-first century. This thesis traces the aims and actions of women struggling for autonomy, equality, and rights in the wake of the AIDS epidemic across a range of scenarios in the United States. It also centres women's fight for autonomy, equality, and rights in the AIDS epidemic within a series of other major historical developments from the 1980s to the present day; namely, abortion politics, the culture wars, the carceral state, and the US healthcare market. It shows that the efforts of the women in this thesis to carve out an autonomous space was not only a right in theory, but became a matter of life and death in the wake of the epidemic. Moreover, this thesis argues that the origins and evolution of activism in the twentieth and twenty-first century United States lie within a persisting tradition of women organising for control over their bodies and lives.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Objective
The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence and comorbidities of personality disorders among incarcerated juveniles and to investigate the validity of these results.
Method
A sample of 790 incarcerated youth (650 boys and 140 girls; mean age = 16.8 years) completed an assessment of Axis II diagnoses (Structured Interview for DSM‐IV Personality). Subjects also completed secondary questionnaires assessing anger–irritability (Youth Self‐Report (YSR)), aggression (YSR), delinquency (Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument‐2), and distress and restraint (Weinberger Adjustment Inventory).
Results
Personality disorders can be found among incarcerated youth at high rates. Many meet the criteria for more than one personality disorder. Those with personality disorders have significant elevations of anger–irritability, aggression, delinquency, and distress and reduced restraint compared with incarcerated youth without a personality disorder.
Conclusions
Results indicate that personality disorders can be found in incarcerated youth at high rates. These findings further our understanding of chronic psychiatric illness and possibly criminal recidivism in this at‐risk population. Addition of personality measures in the assessment of delinquents may assist in the development of more effective interventions. Furthermore, the supportive convergent validity of these findings in a population younger than 18 years may indicate a need to reassess the current rationale for the diagnosis of Axis II disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND Incarceration is associated with increased cardiovascular disease mortality, but prospective studies exploring mechanisms of this association are lacking. METHODS We examined the independent association of prior incarceration with incident hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study—a cohort of young adults aged 18 to 30 years at enrollment in 1985-1986, balanced by sex, race (black and white), and education (high school education or less). We also examined the association of incarceration with left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography and with barriers to health care access. RESULTS Of 4350 participants, 288 (7%) reported previous incarceration. Incident hypertension in young adulthood was more common among former inmates than in those without incarceration history (12% vs 7%; odds ratio, 1.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.2-2.6]), and this association persisted after adjustment for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use, and family income (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.6 [95% CI, 1.0-2.6]). Incarceration was significantly associated with incident hypertension in those groups with the highest prevalence of prior incarceration, ie, black men (AOR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.1-3.5]) and less-educated participants (AOR, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.0-17.3]). Former inmates were more likely to have left ventricular hypertrophy (AOR, 2.7, [95% CI, 0.9-7.9]) and to report no regular source for medical care (AOR, 2.5, [95% CI, 1.3-4.8]). Cholesterol levels and diabetes rates did not differ by history of incarceration. CONCLUSIONS Incarceration is associated with future hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy among young adults. Identification and treatment of hypertension may be important in reducing cardiovascular disease risk among formerly incarcerated individuals.Arch Intern Med. 2009;169(7):687-693-->

N2  - Abstract Objective: To assess whether injecting drug users have a higher than usual risk of death from overdose in the 2 weeks after release from prison. Design: Soundex coding of surnames and information on date of birth were used to link entry and release dates from the local prison between 1983 and 1994 with clinical data from Edinburgh City Hospital's cohort of male injecting drug users who are infected with HIV. Setting: Edinburgh City Hospital and Edinburgh Prison. Subjects: 316/332 male injecting drug users infected with HIV in the City Hospital HIV cohort; 16 were excluded because they were enrolled after developing AIDS or because their precise date of death was not available. Main outcome measure: Relative risk of dying from overdose before developing AIDS and relative risk of dying of all causes before developing AIDS during the 2 weeks after release from prison; this was compared with relative risks of death during other time at liberty. Results: 238/316 (75%) injecting drug users served time in the prison between 1983 and 1994. 33 out of 316 injecting drug users who were infected with HIV died before developing AIDS during 517 177 days at risk. 20 of these men died of an overdose; 6 of these deaths occurred within 2 weeks of release during 5903 days at risk. Death rates from overdose before the development of AIDS were 1.02/1000 days during the 2 weeks after release (recently released) and 0.029/1000 days during other times of liberty. The relative risk of death from overdose became 7.7 (1.5 to 39.1) after temporal matching (when the comparison was limited to the first 2 weeks after release v the next 10 weeks). The crude relative risk in an analysis combining stratified prison term and the 2 weeks after release was 4.5 (1.7 to 11.7) for death from overdose. After temporal matching these risks became 1.8 (0.4 to 9.2). Conclusion: Prisons should evaluate interventions to reduce the risk of death from overdose after release. Key messages Overall, imprisonment does not seem to increase injecting drug users' risks of dying from an overdose Between 1983 and 1994 the risk of death from overdose was eight times higher within 2 weeks after release from prison among injecting drug users infected with HIV than it was during the next 10 weeks after release Further studies will need to determine if the estimate of 1 death from overdose per 1000 days spent recently released can be generalised to those who are not infected with HIV, and to dependent drug users who do not inject drugs Deaths from overdose occurring in the 2 weeks after release from prison may outnumber the deaths from suicide in Scottish prisons by 3 to 1 Lives could be saved by implementing prison based, randomised trials of interventions to reduce the number of deaths from overdose that occur soon after release

N2  - Despite efforts for patient stabilization before radiologic procedures, cardiopulmonary arrests still occur. The purpose of our study was to define the incidence, patient characteristics, and outcomes of patients having cardiopulmonary arrest in a radiology department. We retrospectively reviewed patients sustaining cardiopulmonary arrest in the radiology department from 2002 to 2007. Patient characteristics and outcomes were documented. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Over the 6 years of the study, 1,480,578 radiographic procedures were performed, and 27 patients sustained a cardiopulmonary arrest in the radiology department for an incidence rate of 0.002 per cent. The average patient age was 66 years (range, 35 to 88 years); 12 were male (44%). Radiological procedures were diagnostic in 15 cases and therapeutic in 12 cases. The most common locations for arrest were in the CT area (9 patients) and the vascular procedures area (8 patients). The most common preprocedural patient locations were the hospital wards (11 patients [41%]), the emergency department/trauma bay (5 patients [19%]), the intensive care unit (4 patients [15%]), and an outpatient setting (four patients [15%]). Nineteen patients (70%) survived the initial code, 14 patients (52%) survived 24 hours, and 9 patients (33%) survived until discharge. Survival to discharge was significantly impacted by body mass index ( P = 0.005) and type of radiologic procedure ( P = 0.04) but not by the preprocedure patient location. Cardiopulmonary arrest occurring in the radiology department is a rare but potentially lethal occurrence. Patients undergoing vascular access procedures may be an at-risk group. Further study is needed to evaluate potential risk factors for cardiopulmonary arrest occurring in the radiology department.

N2  - This study was set up to compare risk behaviours between IDU and no-IDU inmates and among IDUs and to elicit the differences of preventive and risk behaviours according to sex. It was carried out in the Baumettes Prison, France, from November 16 to December 21, 1992; 295 male and 137 female inmates were interviewed using a self-questionnaire checked by the medical staff. Twenty per cent of participants (85/432) declared to be IDU (heroin); half of them reported needle sharing. After adjustment for age and sex, the number of sexual partners during the last year was significantly higher among IDU inmates (more than two partners: 19% vs 9.5%); similarly, sexual intercourse with an IDU during the last five years was reported more frequently by IDUs (47% vs 5%). After adjustment for the number of sexual partners, the porportion of IDUs who declared using always condoms was higher than that of non-IDUs (30.5% vs 13%). IDUs reported a prior HIV testing more often than no-IDUs (93% vs 49%). Multidimensional analysis showed that IDU female inmates reported having been HIV tested (100% vs 88%), had sexual intercourse with an IDU (73.5% vs 25.5%) and practised needle sharing (62% vs 43%) more often than male IDU inmates. This survey shows that, beyond drug taking which is the main risk factor for HIV infection in the carceral population, sexual behaviours could be an additional risk factor among IDU inmates, especially among women. Although use of condoms seems to be more frequent among IDU inmates, these findings highlight the need to have a better understanding of risky behaviours in the carceral population and to enhance the counselling and prevention strategy inside the prisons.

N2  - The primary aims of this exploratory pilot study were (1) to determine the proportion of a sample of HIV-positive inmates utilizing primary care after recent release, and (2) to identify variables associated with utilization of primary care at the time of a post-release interview. Sixty HIV-positive, male and female state prison inmates were interviewed approximately three months prior to release, and 30 were interviewed again between seven and 21 days after release. Variables associated with having utilized primary care at the time of a post-release interview (χ
2
p-values < 0.20) included: taking anti-HIV medications at the time of release, no alcohol use since release, living in the same place as before incarceration and rating of housing situation as 'comfortable' or 'very comfortable'. For exploratory purposes, these variables were entered into a logistic regression model. The model correctly classified 80% of cases overall. Future studies are required to ascertain whether these results would obtain with a statistically adequate sample size.

N2  - Background Glucocorticoids can reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with ischemia and reperfusion injury following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and circulatory arrest. The hypothesis was that maintenance of cardiac function after CPB with methylprednisolone therapy results, in part, from preservation of myocyte calcium cycling. Methods Piglets (5–7kg) underwent CPB and 120min of hypothermic circulatory arrest with (CPB-GC) or without (CPB) methylprednisolone (30 mg kg−1 ) administered 6h before and at CPB. Controls (No-CPB) did not undergo CPB or receive glucocorticoids ( n = 6 per treatment). Myocardial function was monitored in vivo for 120min after CPB. Calcium cycling was analyzed using rapid line-scan confocal microscopy in isolated, fluo-3-AM-loaded cardiac myocytes. Phospholamban phosphorylation and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA2a) protein levels were determined by immunoblotting of myocardium collected 120min after CPB. Calpain activation in myocardium was measured by fluorometric assay. Results Preload recruitable stroke work in vivo 120min after reperfusion decreased from baseline in CPB (47.4 ± 12 versus 26.4 ± 8.3 slope of the regression line, P < 0.05), but was not different in CPB-GC (41 ± 8.1 versus 37.6 ± 2.2, P = 0.7). In myocytes isolated from piglets, total calcium transient time remained unaltered in CPB-GC (368 ± 52.5 ms) compared with controls (434.5 ± 35.3 ms; P = 0.07), but was prolonged in CPB myocytes (632 ± 83.4 ms; P < 0.01). Calcium transient amplitude was blunted in myocytes from CPB (757 ± 168nM) compared with controls (1127 ± 126nM, P < 0.05) but was maintained in CPB-GC (1021 ± 155nM, P > 0.05). Activation of calpain after CPB was reduced with glucocorticoids. Phospholamban phosphorylation and SERCA2a protein levels in myocardium were decreased in CPB compared with No-CPB and CPB-GC ( P < 0.05). Conclusions The glucocorticoid-mediated improvement in myocardial function after CPB might be due, in part, to prevention of calpain activation and maintenance of cardiac myocyte calcium cycling.

N2  - Background and Aims:  Needlestick injuries are an occupational hazard for prison officers. This study aimed to assess the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in syringes found in prisons.
Methods:  Sixty‐nine syringes found in prisons were tested for HCV RNA using previously published methods.
Results:  Three syringes tested positive for HCV RNA.
Conclusion:  Compared to the prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users in prisons, few syringes were found to contain HCV RNA. It is likely that conditions under which syringes are kept in prisons are not favorable for survival of detectable HCV RNA. Further work is needed to establish the risk of HCV transmission posed by needlestick injuries in prison settings.

N2  - Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem recognised by the UK National Strategy that proposes that a care pathway for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment be established in all prisons, integrated within managed clinical networks. A prison sentence provides the opportunity to focus on traditionally hard to reach patients. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of HCV infection in a UK prison cluster and to assess the effectiveness of a prison outreach service for hepatitis C. Subjects: Male prisoners. Methods: A nurse specialist led clinic within a cluster of adult prisons was established, offering health education on hepatitis C, advice on harm minimisation, and HCV testing. Infected prisoners were offered access to a care pathway leading to treatment. Outcome measures were uptake of the service, and diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C. Results: A total of 8.5% of 1618 prisoners accepted testing: 30% had active infection with HCV. Most were ineligible for treatment due to psychiatric illness or did not receive treatment for logistic reasons. Injecting drug use was the major risk factor in all cases. Only 7% of HCV polymerase chain amplification positive inmates received treatment in prison. Conclusion: There is a large pool of HCV infected prisoners at risk of complications, constituting a source of infection during their sentence and after discharge. A prison outreach clinic and care pathway was perceived as effective in delivering health education, reducing the burden on prison and hospital services. It provided an opportunity for intervention but had a limited effect in eradicating HCV in prisoners and it remains unclear how this might be achieved.

N2  - Incarcerated women at a state correctional facility (
N
= 213) participated in a study of the relationship between stress, adjustment, institutional misconduct, and degree of personal support derived from religious participation. A series of multivariate analyses of variance investigated differences on adjustment indicators between four groups of inmates who differed on their self-reported support from religious activities, while controlling for self-reported support for other institutional activities. Inmates who received high-level support from participation in religious activities reported significantly less depression, recounted perpetrating fewer aggressive acts, and committed fewer serious institutional infractions than those who did not attend religious activities as well as those who attended but reported receiving low-level support. In addition, inmates reporting a high level of support through their religious activities reported fewer instances of feeling angry, having arguments with inmates and correctional officers, physical fights, and injury than those who reported no participation in religious activities. Results indicate that inmates who perceive that they are receiving personal support from religious activities are better adjusted to the challenges of prison.

N2  - The present study aimed to examine the difference in self-control strength between individuals with and without antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in a Chinese male prisoner sample. Thirty-seven male inmates who met the criteria for DSM-IV ASPD and 38 who did not were asked to watch a four-minute silent videotape of an interview, and ignore the words displayed on screen during the videotape to deplete their ego strength. A handgrip task was conducted both before and after watching the videotape, with participants' time squeezing the handgrip being the dependent variable. Result showed a significant interaction between group (ASPD/no-ASPD group) and time (baseline/post-manipulation measure). The post-manipulation result was significantly worse than the baseline result for the ASPD group, but not for the no-ASPD group. These results indicate that tasks that contribute to ego depletion lead to a deficit of self-control strength in prisoners with ASPD.

N2  - Findings from the first national survey on juvenile suicide in confinement are provided, and include the extent and distribution of juvenile suicides, as well as descriptive data on demographic characteristics of each victim, incident, and juvenile facility which sustained the suicide. Among the significant findings were that suicides were evenly distributed, i.e., the same number of deaths occurred within the first few days of confinement as occurred over many months of confinement; most deaths occurred during traditional waking hours; a strong association between room confinement and suicide was found, and no relationship between intoxication and suicide was found. Suicide prevention resources were found to be particularly lacking in juvenile detention centers that experienced suicides.

N2  - This study explores the relationship between intellectual ability (IA) and the treatment needs of male offenders in a therapeutic community prison. A sample of 1627 offenders with varying levels of IA as measured using the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM; Raven,
1958
) were compared on psychometric measures assessing offence-related treatment needs. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that offenders with a lower level of IA had significantly higher scores on particular scales of the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ; Caine, Foulds, & Hope,
1967
), the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS; Walters,
1995
) and the Blame Attribution Inventory (BAI; Gudjonsson,
1984
), and a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) found that these differences persisted even after controlling for social desirability. Findings suggest that offenders with a lower level of IA may require adapted treatment interventions that target differences in treatment need.

N2  - High rates of serious mental illnesses (SMI) among jail inmates pose challenges for the criminal justice system and risks for the individual with SMI. Research has identified actions to address these issues; it is unclear to what extent they have been operationalized. This study examines jails in one state, exploring how individuals with SMI are identified and treated, and comparing these with research-based recommendations. Results indicate that jails are not using evidence-based screenings, staff require training in SMI, access to services and medications for jailed individuals with SMI is often slow, and coordination between community providers and jails is limited.

N2  - The Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) programme was introduced to assess, manage and treat severely personality disordered individuals who present a high risk of serious offending. We describe the clinical and risk characteristics of the first 241 patients admitted to the high-security DSPD service for assessment. Eighty-four percent of patients were regarded as meeting the DSPD criteria. Clinically, the DSPD patients demonstrated high levels of psychopathy, with 78% scoring 25 or more on the Psychopathy Checklist. The most commonly diagnosed personality disorders were antisocial, borderline and paranoid. The risk assessments indicated the DSPD patients exhibited a broad range of risk factors for future offending, suggesting that these patients had extensive treatment needs. The DSPD service had been relatively successful in retaining patients, with 82% of those admitted to treatment remaining within the high-security DSPD service. The clinical mix of the patients may have implications for treatment outcome, and future challenges for the service are highlighted.

N2  - Psychosocially vulnerable prisoners under stressful conditions of confinement are ill prepared to cope and at risk for developing suicide intention. The present study examined the relationships of depression, hopelessness, reasons for living, mental health problem history, suicide attempt lethality history, and stressful segregation housing with suicide ideation in 134 prisoners. Prisoners housed in segregation were found to have significantly higher levels of depression and suicide ideation than prisoners in general population. A hierarchical regression model of suicide ideation found significant interactions between mental health problem history, suicide attempt lethality history, and hopelessness with anticipated segregation stress, independent of depressed mood. Results of the study are discussed in terms of the stress‐vulnerability model, various methodological limitations, and future research.

N2  - An estimated 15%–40% of incarcerated persons in the United States are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Approximately 1.4 million HCV-infected persons pass through the corrections system annually, accounting for one-third of the total number of HCV-infected persons in the United States. This high prevalence of HCV infection is due to the substantial increase in drug-related arrests over the past 2 decades. Although the hepatitis C epidemic in the corrections system may be viewed as a burden on correctional health systems, it is an important public health opportunity and an obligation. Research on the implementation of cost-effective HCV screening, prevention, and treatment programs among incarcerated persons is essential. Testing, education, and, when appropriate, treatment of prisoners should be a cornerstone of the public health response to the hepatitis C epidemic in the United States.

N2  - Background: Outbreaks of tuberculosis are uncommonly recognized in jails. In 1996, an increase in active tuberculosis cases was noted among inmates of a large urban jail.
Objectives: To determine the source and extent of a tuberculosis outbreak in an urban jail and to recommend control measures.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Urban jail.
Patients: Inmates and guards with tuberculosis.
Intervention: Outbreak evaluation and control.
Measurements: Medical records of inmates and guards with tuberculosis were reviewed, and inmates were interviewed. DNA fingerprinting was performed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates.
Results: From 1 January 1995 through 31 December 1997, active tuberculosis was diagnosed in 38 inmates and 5 guards from the jail. Nineteen (79%) of the 24 culture-positive inmates had isolates with DNA fingerprints matching those of other inmates. Isolates from both culture-positive guards matched the predominant inmate strain; only 6 (14%) of 43 isolates from infected persons in the community had this pattern. The median length of incarceration of all inmates in the jail was 1 day; the median length of continuous incarceration before diagnosis of tuberculosis in inmates was 138 days. Inmates with tuberculosis had been incarcerated a median of 15 times. Forty-three percent of persons in this city with tuberculosis diagnosed from January 1995 through July 1997 had been incarcerated in the jail at some time before diagnosis.
Conclusions: Traditional and molecular epidemiologic investigations suggest that tuberculosis was transmitted among inmates and guards in an urban jail. Aggressive measures to screen for active tuberculosis upon incarceration are important for preventing spread of disease in jails and to the surrounding community.

N2  - Personality self-report questionnaires are frequently used in forensic settings to detect psychopathology, to predict recidivism, and to assess adaptability to life in prison. Although most personality questionnaires include validity or control scales, even with the scales most outcomes can be easily manipulated. The aim of this study is to analyze the utility of the control scales of the Situational Personality Questionnaire (SPQ). A sample of 200 male prisoners was randomized into two groups. Both groups completed the SPQ as a part of the mandatory psychological assessment when they entered prison, and then again eight months later. In time 2, one group received instructions to falsify the results of the questionnaire. Results indicated that the feigned induction was effective. The control scales were not able to detect feigners. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for further research into assessing fake responses in forensic settings.

N2  - Background
The aim of this study was to investigate suicidal ideations and associated psychopathology in two groups of adolescents, a sample of detained youth and a general population sample. In both groups the comparisons of mental health characteristics between suicidal ideators and non-suicidal youth were conducted separately for girls and boys.
Methods
The study sample consisted of 290 delinquent adolescents [228 boys and 62 girls] from three Flemish juvenile detention centers and 1,548 adolescents [811 boys and 737 girls] from an age-matched school-based sample. Both groups were administered the Social and Health Assessment [SAHA], a self-report survey investigating levels of psychopathology [internalizing and externalizing] and risk-taking behavior.
Results
Suicidal ideations during the past year were reported by 21.5% of detained males, compared to 6.7% in the general population. In females, 58.1% of detained individuals reported suicidal thoughts during the past year, compared to 14.4% of the general population. In girls and boys from the general population, both internalizing and externalizing problems were higher in suicidal ideators than in non-suicidal youth, while in the detention group mainly internalizing problems were higher in suicidal ideators. When comparing detention suicidal ideators with those from the general population, male suicidal ideators scored higher on delinquency, while detained female suicidal ideators also scored higher on posttraumatic stress, but lower on prosocial beliefs.
Limitations
Information used in this study was solely based on self-report measures only and limited to Flemish adolescents.
Conclusion
Since suicidal ideation is a frequent problem in detained youth, adequate recognition and treatment seems clinically relevant. While both internalizing and externalizing psychopathology may be an indicator of suicidal ideation in the general population, internalizing problems may be the main clinical predictor in detained youth.

N2  - Psychiatric morbidity and suicide rates in prisoners are high. The detection of mental illness and its associated risks in prison are low. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology, needs and self-harming behaviour among UK female prisoners and to identify differences between individuals with and without a history of self-harm. We conducted a cross-sectional study including 638 female prisoners from two prisons in the North-West of England. Outcome measures used were the Prison Screening Questionnaire (PriSnQuest), a questionnaire on self-harming behaviour and suicidal ideation and the Camberwell Assessment of Need - Forensic Version (CANFOR). 241 women (37.8%) screened positive on the PriSnQuest; 281 women (45.9%) had a history of self-harm. An average of 8.5 needs was identified with more than half of those needs classified as unmet. Differences between women with and without history of self-harm were identified on offending history, PriSnQuest scores and the CANFOR total and unmet needs. Previous contact with a psychiatrist, total and symptoms of depression on the PriSnQuest were independently associated with a history of self-harm. This study confirmed that the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology and self-harm in female UK prisoners is high. Individuals at risk of self-harming behaviour may be identified using screening questionnaires.

N2  - Jail recidivists with serious mental illness and substance use disorders were treated in an in-custody setting and then randomly assigned to either a high fidelity Integrated Dual Disorders Treatment program (103 participants) or to service as usual (79 participants). Outcomes were tracked an average of 18 months from program entry at the termination of the initial incarceration. A reduction in jail days from baseline to study period was significant for both groups. The pre to post reduction for arrests and total convictions was significant in the experimental group but not the control group. However, during the study period, differences between experimental and control groups in arrests, convictions and jail days were not statistically significant. Experimental participants had lower study period psychiatric inpatient and crisis utilization and greater outpatient utilization than did control group participants. The groups did not differ with regard to total institutional days. Experimental group attrition was relatively high.

N2  - Objectives. We examined gender similarities and differences in the predictors of substance use treatment entry and of the combination of treatment entry and completion.
Methods. The sample consisted of 2219 male and female program participants. Maximum likelihood probit estimation was used to identify background and attitudinal characteristics predictive of substance use treatment entry and retention.
Results. We observed gender similarities and differences in predictors of treatment entry and the combination of treatment entry and completion. Many of the factors that attract individuals to treatment are the same ones that keep individuals in treatment.
Conclusions. Attitudinal predictors—namely, motivation to change—showed the greatest consistency between genders and between predictors of treatment entry and predictors of treatment entry and completion.

N2  - Abstract We report here on a feasibility study of initiating buprenorphine/naloxone prior to release from incarceration and linking participants to community treatment providers upon release. The study consisted of a small number of Rhode Island (RI) prisoners ( N = 44) diagnosed with opioid dependence. The study design is a single arm, open-label pilot study with a 6-month follow up interview conducted in the community. However, a natural experiment arose during the study comparing pre-release initiation of buprenorphone/naloxone to initiation post-release. Time to post-release prescriber appointment (mean days) for initiation of treatment outside Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) versus inside RIDOC was 8.8 and 3.9, respectively ( p = .1). Median post release treatment duration (weeks) for outside RIDOC versus inside RIDOC was 9 and 24, respectively ( p = .007). We conclude that initiating buprenorphine/naloxone prior to release from incarceration may increase engagement and retention in community-based treatment.

N2  - One focus of chemoprevention research is the interaction of nutrients with specific molecular targets associated with the maintenance of genomic stability. This study tested the impact of dietary niacin status on bone marrow NAD
+
and poly(ADP-ribose) (pADPr) levels, p53 expression, and etoposide (ETO)-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. After 3 wk on niacin-deficient (ND), pair-fed niacin-replete (PF), or nicotinic acid-supplemented (4 g/kg diet) (NA) diets, Long-Evans rats were gavaged with ETO (25 mg/kg) or vehicle. ND and NA diets caused a 72% decrease and a 240% increase in bone marrow NAD
+
, respectively. Basal and ETO-induced pADPr levels differed dramatically among ND, PF, and NA diets (undetectable, 42 and 216 fmol/million cells, respectively; basal and undetectable, 119 and 484 fmol/million cells, respectively, following ETO). ND diet alone caused overexpression of two distinct isoforms of p53. Levels of p53 in PF and NA marrow increased in response to ETO treatment, but this did not occur in ND bone marrow. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of regular and alternative spliced variants of p53 mRNA revealed that niacin deficiency actually decreased both forms of p53 message, implicating protein stability in the accumulation of p53 in ND marrow. ETO-induced apoptosis (TUNEL) was suppressed during niacin deficiency and enhanced by supplementation. G1 arrest was also impaired in ND bone marrow relative to PF and NA. Despite a poor G1 arrest, p21
waf1
was overexpressed in the ND bone marrow and dramatically induced following ETO treatment. In conclusion, dietary niacin deficiency causes changes in NAD
+
and pADPr metabolism, alters p53 expression, and impairs cellular responses to DNA damage.

N2  - Research with returning prisoners and their partners finds astoundingly high rates of partner violence—as much as tenfold those observed in the general population. Yet very little is known about its nature or etiology in the context of the American experiment in hyper-incarceration. The current project responds to this gap by integrating qualitative narratives with couples-based, longitudinal survey data to understand the nature and etiology of partner violence among former prisoners and their partners. It draws on data from the Multi-site Family Study on Incarceration, Parenting and Partnering to address four aims: 1. Examine patterns in the use of physical violence and controlling behavior by returning prisoners and their partners using latent class analysis and a stratified qualitative case study. 2. Investigate qualitative understandings and experiences of partner violence among returning prisoners and their partners and their perceived connection to experiences of state and structural violence through an inductive qualitative analysis. 3. Test quantitative relationships between individual criminal justice system exposure and later partner violence perpetration using structural equation modeling with couples-based survey data. 4. Examine whether and how local social and material conditions associated with mass incarceration predict partner violence perpetration by men returning from prison using structural equation modeling with couples-based survey data linked to representative data sources on local characteristics. This work reveals dense connections between government-sanctioned violence and acts of 4 violence in private homes and relationships. Applying Bronfenbrenner’s social ecological framework to synthesize results from four empirical inquiries, the study links partner violence to the state violence of criminalization and imprisonment and the structural violence of material deprivation and heightened mortality in hyper-incarcerated communities. The stories told by former prisoners and their partners reveal the coextension of violence and penal authority across carceral, domestic, and street spaces. They highlight how strategies of resistance to authority in one sphere become tools of domination in another and how heteropatriarchal social structures help to reallocate and obscure the harms of incarceration. Quantitative testing of hypotheses generated from qualitative data suggest how childhood criminal justice system exposure and cumulative criminal justice system exposure during adulthood each predict later partner violence perpetration via (distinct) behavioral health problems. Results also identify two different classes of partner violence among returning prisoners and their partners—coercive controlling violence and jealous-only situational violence—that are distinguished by accompanying patterns of controlling behavior (consistent with Johnson’s typology). While the types have different proximal precursors and different apparent consequences for victims, both are predicted by the local adversities associated with geographically concentrated incarceration. Built on the insights of partner violence survivors and survivors of mass incarceration, this work advances a new empirical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between penal authority and violence. It also reveals the workings of gender as an instrument of harm transfer in hyper-incarcerated poor communities of color. It argues that the most pervasive form of violence in America deserves focal attention in scholarly conversations about hyper-incarceration and as part of the urgent policy projects of decarceration and reparation.

N2  - Cancer pain management among prison inmates is an emerging problem. To examine the obstacles to cancer pain management in inmates, surveys of inmates with cancer pain (IPs) (n
=
102) and primary care practitioners (PCPs) (n
=
74) in Texas state prisons were conducted. IPs were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory and Pain Management Index (PMI). PCPs were assessed with a modified Clinic Staff Survey of Cancer Pain Management. Eighty-three IPs (81%) reported severe worst pain; 51 (49%) reported severe average pain. Thirty-three IPs (32%) reported no pain relief with prescribed analgesics. PMI was negative in 65 IPs (64%), indicating undertreatment. Of the PCPs, 20/65 (31%) felt that IPs were undertreated. Most frequently cited barriers to pain management were drug misuse/diversion and lack of inmate credibility. Practitioner problems and systemic barriers also were cited frequently. These results indicate the existence of unique barriers to undertreatment of cancer pain in IPs. A multidisciplinary approach involving prison authorities and practitioners is required to improve pain management in prison populations.

N2  - Objectives. After syphilis outbreaks were reported at 3 Alabama State men's prisons in early 1999, we conducted an investigation to evaluate risk factors for syphilis infection and describe patterns of syphilis transmission.
Methods. We reviewed medical, patient interview, and prison transfer records and documented sexual networks. Presumptive source cases were identified. Odds of exposure to unscreened jail populations and transfer from other prisons were calculated for case patients at 1 prison.
Results. Thirty-nine case patients with early syphilis were identified from 3 prisons. Recent jail exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 8.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.3, 158.7, P = .14) and prison transfer (OR = 32.0, 95% CI = 1.6, 1668.1, P < .01) were associated with being a source case patient.
Conclusions. Probable sources of syphilis introduction into and transmission within prisons included mixing of prisoners with unscreened jail populations, transfer of infected inmates between prisons, and multiple concurrent sexual partnerships. Reducing sexual transmission of disease in correctional settings is a public health priority and will require innovative prevention strategies.

N2  - [...]they added up to an edifice with many entryways that can be visited according to the inspiration of the reader. [...]what determines the general organization of the postexotic chanson de geste is its background, the upstream presence of a carceral choir, a fragmentary literature that is whispered or screamed by tens of prisoners in an imaginary prison that is an integral part of our structure, an ideological and literary constant that only emerges clearly in one book-PostExoticism in Ten Lessons, Lesson Eleven. Individuals, men and women, whose daily environment includes ruins, a dearth of technology, meager resources, and the quasi-disappearance of the human race. Postapocalypse, humanity's extinction period, and the end of an industrial universe allow for strong images and offer postexotic authors significant narrative freedom while preserving, within our attention, the interior discourse and visions of our protagonists.

N2  - Growing evidence indicates that women in prison are particularly vulnerable to many negative health outcomes, including cervical cancer. The Papanicolaou (Pap) test is an effective tool to screen for this disease. To determine what is and is not working with the Pap test and follow-up treatment, we performed qualitative interviews with women prisoners and key informants at a California state women’s prison. Our assessment revealed that the process of administering Pap tests at this institution was not meeting the health care needs of the women interviewed.
Women reported having negative experiences during the test and with their health care providers. Additionally the prison’s culture and infrastructure create obstacles that hinder prisoners from receiving quality care and providers from delivering that care. In response, women prisoners use self-and community advocacy to meet their health care needs and cope with these challenges.

N2  - This study examines whether witnessing community violence, in the 12 months prior to juvenile detention, is related and health-related outcomes in the 2 months prior to being detained among 550 youth. Participants answered survey questions using audio-computer assisted self-interviewing procedures, which assessed demographic, problem, and drug and sexual risk behaviors. Multiple logistic regression analyses, controlling for significant covariates, indicated that adolescents, in the last 12 months, who reported witnessing community violence, relative to their peer witnessing no violence, were in the last 2 months prior to being detained, twice more likely to have suicidal threats, 2 times more likely to use marijuana and alcohol, 2 times more likely to get high on alcohol or other drugs during sexual intercourse, and 2 times more likely to have sex with a partner who was high on alcohol or other drugs. Finding suggest that detained youth, many of whom may not access traditional helath care, should be offered prevention and intervention services dring detention, which provides a critical window of opportunity for needed services.

N2  - Research has lately increased its focus on work conditions as predictors of stress among prison workers but only few studies have focused on how the exposure of workers to psychosocial risks vary according to their occupational groups and their contact with inmates. Work psychosocial risks (demands, control and social support) were assessed using the Spanish version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire among 164 Spanish prison workers (43 per cent of those surveyed). Regression analysis was used to explore how psychosocial hazards and their combinations (outcome variables) vary according to occupational groups. Results suggest that psychosocial risks were highest among guards that have more contact with inmates. Implications of the findings for policy making and practice application are discussed.

N2  - This project analyzes contemporary U.S. mental health discourse as an assemblage that constantly renegotiates the normative subject through the production and regulation of intersectional mentally ill subjects. It uses feminist disability and biopolitical theoretical frameworks to explore how media discourses of mental illness reveal the regulation of mentally ill subjects in relationship to intersections of gender, sexuality, and race. These discourses constitute a biopolitical technology that genders, racializes, and regulates mental illness. This regulation not only reveals the cultural boundaries around who is designated as “mentally ill” (and how they are designated as such), but it also demonstrates how mental illness is normalized when attached to certain bodies in specific contexts, yet perceived as a threat to the social body when attached to other bodies in other contexts. In order to explore this assemblage, this project is organized around four foundational questions: How is mental illness produced, surveilled, and differentially regulated as a social formation within medicine and policy? How does media reproduce and renegotiate these medical and political mental health discourses? How do these mental health discourses intersect with gender, race, and sexuality? How does our assemblage of cultural, medical, and political discourse produce, observe, and regulate intersectional mentally ill subjects in relationship to shifting ideals of normative subjecthood? This project answers these questions over the course of several case studies, each of which explores a set of thematically linked texts as a window into understanding how mental illness operates intersectionally and biopolitically in cultural discourses and social institutions. The first section establishes a broad theoretical framework for articulating how discourses of gender and sexuality are central to the production of mental illness in the United States today. The second section explores how this intersection of gender, sexuality, and mental illness is observed and regulated through social institutions like the workplace, the nation-state, and the carceral system. The final section explores emergent discourses of mental illness that move us away from centering individual mentally healthy subjects as idealized entities and toward understanding mental and emotional well-being as a collective social enterprise.

N2  - High‐dose benzodiazepine (BDZs) represents an important risk factor for dependence, particularly in a prison environment. In Lyon’s prison, BDZs and/or opioid maintenance treatment are often prescribed to patients with mental disorders. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of psychiatrist and pharmacist collaboration on reducing the BDZs dose prescribed to prisoner patients. Since 2001, clinicians and pharmacists have been holding monthly meetings to develop prescribing guidelines and discuss those patients receiving high‐dose BDZs. All prescribed psychotropic drugs were noted for each included patient in the control (before guidelines) and intervention groups. Criteria used to define each patient profile included age, diagnosis (mental disorder), and concomitant treatment (opioids, antidepressants). To compare each group, the daily dose of prescribed BDZs was used as a quantitative variable and expressed in diazepam equivalent. Four hundred and seventy‐three patients were included, 222 in the control group and 251 in the intervention group. The two groups showed no difference in terms of diagnosis. The daily dose of BDZ was higher in the control group when all patients were considered (meanCONTROL GROUP = 46 mg in diazepam equivalent vs. meanINTERVENTIION GROUP = 34 mg) and for each of the following patient categories: ‘mental disorder’ (48 mg vs. 30 mg), ‘no opioid treatment’ (44 mg vs. 31 mg), ‘buprenorphin treatment’ (58 mg vs. 63 mg), ‘no antidepressant treatment’ (41 mg vs. 29 mg), and ‘antidepressant treatment’ (53 mg vs. 38 mg). The results of this retrospective study show the positive impact of multidisciplinary intervention on reducing the prescribed daily dose of BDZs. This experience confirms the positive impact that pharmacist feedback on prescriptions and the development of treatment guidelines by clinician and pharmacist collaboration have on improving the prescribing practice in a prison environment.

N2  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its relationship with a range of traumatic events have previously been documented within various traumatized groups in Western countries. In the present study, the authors investigated the relationship between the frequency and type of traumatic events and the prevalence of PTSD among female prisoners in China.
A structured psychiatric interview, the self-report Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire, and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised were administered to a subset of 471 female members who were randomly selected from Hunan female prison, China.
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (
DSM-IV) diagnoses were assigned by consensus after the interviews were evaluated by independent raters.
The prevalences of lifetime and current PTSD were 15.9% (n = 75) and 10.6% (n = 50), and 82% (n = 386) of the subjects had experienced at least 1 traumatic event. The whole sample was divided into 2 groups according to age: the younger group (age ≤25 years) and the older group (age >25 years) .The most predictive factor for lifetime PTSD among the younger age group was the experience of sudden death of a close friend or a loved one, childhood physical abuse, intimate partner abuse, and sexual abuse before the age of 13 years by someone at least 5 years older. For the older group, the most predictive factors were a history of motor traffic accident, sudden death of a close friend or a loved one, severe assault by acquaintance or stranger, witness to family violence, having experienced more than 5 traumatic events, intimate partner abuse, and sexual abuse before the age of 13 years by someone at least 5 years older. Those females with PTSD tended to demonstrate higher levels of anger/hostility or interpersonal sensitivity than those without either partial or full diagnosis.
In this sample of female prisoners in China, although exposure to traumatic events was common and the rate is nearly as high as that in western countries, the prevalences of lifetime and current PTSD were relatively lower. Moreover, the prevalence of current PTSD among younger prisoners was significantly higher than that among older prisoners. The risk of developing lifetime PTSD was significantly greater only for older prisoners with a history of more than 5 traumatic events, whereas the types of specific traumatic events with the risk of developing lifetime PTSD among younger prisoners were similar to that among older prisoners. Administering specialized treatments for anger dyscontrol and interpersonal sensitivity may be useful for rehabilitation and reform of female prisoners.

N2  - Abstract Objectives: To determine prevalence of mental disorder among male unconvicted prisoners and to assess the treatment needs of this population. Design: Semi-structured interview and case note review of randomly selected cross section of male remand population. Non-attenders were replaced by the next name on prison roll. Setting: Three young offenders' institutions and 13 adult men's prisons. Subjects: 750 prisoners, representing 9.4% cross sectional sample of male unconvicted population. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of ICD-10 diagnoses of mental disorder, and associated treatment needs. Results: Psychiatric disorder was diagnosed in 469 (63%) inmates. The main diagnoses were: substance misuse, 285 (38%); neurotic illness, 192 (26%); personality disorder, 84 (11%); psychosis, 36 (5%); other and uncertain, 36 (0.5%). Subjects could have more than one diagnosis. The average refusal rate was 18%. In total 414 inmates (55%) were judged to have an immediate treatment need: transfer to an NHS bed, 64 (9%); treatment by prison health care services, 131 (17%); motivational interviewing for substance misuse, 115 (15%); and therapeutic community placement, 104 (14%). Conclusions: Mental disorder was common among male unconvicted prisoners. Psychosis was present at four or five times the level found in the general population. Extrapolation of our results suggests that remand population as a whole probably contains about 680 men who need transfer to hospital for psychiatric treatment, including about 380 prisoners with serious mental illness. Key messages We conducted a survey of the point prevalence of psychiatric disorder in men remanded in custody in England and Wales and assessed their treatment needs A diagnosis of psychiatric disorder was made in 63% of those surveyed, including 5% with psychosis Over half of these prisoners were judged to have an immediate treatment need—most could be treated inside prison, but 9% needed transfer to a psychiatric bed outside prison By extrapolation, the remand population probably contains about 680 men who need transfer to hospital for psychiatric treatment, including about 380 with serious mental illness Prison treatment facilities for unconvicted prisoners need substantial expansion

N2  - Within Canadian prisons HIV/AIDS is becoming more common among inmates. While injection drug use in correctional facilities is documented to be a problem, qualitative research into the HIV risks faced by inmates is lacking. The goal of this research was to qualitatively examine HIV risk associated with injecting inside British Columbia prisons. A sample of 26 former male inmates who had recently used drugs within correctional facilities were recruited from a ongoing cohort study of injection drug users in Vancouver, Canada. Data for this study were collected through in-depth interviews conducted in 2001/2002. Analysis of these data involved identifying emergent themes and then exploring these central concepts in further interviews to confirm the accuracy of interpretation. The harms normally associated with drug addiction, and injection drug use are exacerbated in prison. Interpersonal relationships and the possession of exchangeable resources determine access to scarce syringes. The scarcity of syringes has resulted in patterns of sharing amongst large numbers of persons. Continual reuse of scarce syringes poses serious health hazards and bleach distribution is an inadequate solution. The findings of this study emphasize the need for effective harm reduction programs that provide an appropriate response to the problem of injection drug use among inmates.

N2  - This thesis considers what happens when a prisoner in England dies from natural causes. It explores the impact of deaths from natural causes on prison regimes, culture and relationships and demonstrates what determines the responses of prison regimes and personnel to dying prisoners. It is significant because to date there have been no studies of these deaths which considers their impact on the prison as an institution. Data collected using ethnographic methods in two prisons in the north of England in 2017 and 2018 shows how staff and prisoners understand the carceral geography of death and dying, construct the identity of the dying prisoner and define quality end of life care. The thesis concludes that, within limits, deaths from natural causes in prison custody soften the usual distinctions between what is expected or not expected, permitted or not permitted, between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ prison. This is both tangible and intangible in prison regimes, culture and relationships and informs the responses of prison regimes and personnel to dying prisoners. The thesis challenges existing literature by demonstrating care quietly permeating through prison culture. It considers palliative care in prisons more holistically than existing studies, which are often limited to the medical care of terminally ill prisoners. It argues that in the perception of prisoners and staff, prison changes death, and death changes prison.

N2  - Background: Chlamydia trachomatis screening test positivity among women in the United States has remained high, leading researchers to suggest that programs should also screen men. Men have been screened in Philadelphia prisons since 2002. Philadelphia prisons are similar to jails in other jurisdictions; in 2003 the median duration of incarceration was 17 days. We studied whether screening and treating men in prison influenced C. trachomatis infection among women living in their communities. Methods: We divided the city into 2 areas: "high-treatment" (high percentage of men were treated for C. trachomatis detected in prison) and "low-treatment" (low percentage of men were treated for C. trachomatis detected in prison). We compared changes in test positivity among women from those areas, who were tested in family planning clinics during the 2 years before versus the 3 years after the male prison screening program began. Results: In 2002 to 2004, prison screening led to treatment of 1054 infections among 23,203 men aged 20 to 24 years living in hightreatment areas and 98 infections among 21,057 men aged 20 to 24 years in low-treatment areas. Test positivity declined among 20- to 24-year-old women in both areas. In high-treatment areas, positivity decreased 9.1% per year from 1999 to 2001 and 4.9% per year from 2001 to 2004. In low-treatment areas, positivity decreased 13.2% per year from 1999 to 2001 and 7.5% per year from 2001 to 2004. Conclusion: C. trachomatis test positivity among 20- to 24-year-old women tested in family planning clinics continued to decrease after men were treated for C. trachomatis; however, we found no evidence that the continued decrease was due to the new prison screening program.

N2  - Objectives: To determine whether infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurred after two potential episodes of exposure through needle‐ and syringe‐sharing in Australian prisons, and to examine use of post‐exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against HIV infection in the prison setting.
Design: Cohort study of potential contacts of two prisoners infected with HIV, HBV and HCV followed up for up to 14 months.
Setting: Two Australian prisons between November 2000 (time of exposure) and December 2001.
Participants: Two index patients (both infected with HIV and HCV; one also infectious for HBV) from two different prisons, and 104 inmates who shared needles and syringes.
Main outcome measures: Seroconversions to HIV, HBV and HCV related to the high‐risk exposure and uptake and completion of HIV PEP determined from medical records of inmates.
Results: There were four seroconversions to HCV within 14 months of the potential exposure (14% of those susceptible in the cohort), but no recorded HIV or HBV seroconversions. Forty‐six inmates (82% of those eligible) were offered PEP, and 34 of these (74%) elected to receive it. Only eight (24% of the 34) completed the full PEP course.
Conclusions: HCV transmission in the prison setting is related to high‐risk needle‐ and syringe‐sharing. Administering HIV PEP in the prison setting is complicated by challenging risk assessment and follow‐up.

N2  - In 2000, Thailand spent over US$150 million on prison health care (including infrastructure-related costs), but less than US$25,000 was spent on HIV/AIDS care [7]. [...]October 2005, the total annual health budget per prisoner was around US$3.5, disbursed through the Department of Corrections. Injecting drug use in the prisons has decreased in recent years, partly because of reduced availability of heroin (inside and outside).\n In terms of treatment, drug supply has been handed over to the government and training and mentoring has provided prison medical staff with the skills to manage most problems. [...]we would like to thank the peer reviewers who devoted considerable time to suggesting improvements to our initial submission.

N2  - Methamphetamine (MAP) abuse has been common in Taiwan for the past decade. The purpose of the present study was to investigate MAP abuse in Taiwan, with specific attention to psychiatric comorbidity and gender differences. A total of 325 MAP abuse subjects (180 male, 145 female) from a detention center in Taipei were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. The following were studied: drug use behavior, treatment‐seeking behavior, lifetime prevalence of mood disorders, MAP psychosis, alcohol use disorders, pathological gambling and antisocial personality. The MAP‐abuse subjects in Taiwan had high psychiatric morbidity and low access to mental health services. There also exist certain differences in the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses and treatment‐seeking behavior between male and female subjects. Compared with their male counterparts, more female subjects reported experience of mental disturbance and experience of psychiatric treatment. The female subjects more commonly reported suicidal behaviors than the male subjects.

N2  - Just as reliance on documents in the jail clinic allowed certain kinds of care to flourish, so too did the predictable structure of the clinic’s daily flow. The clinic’s rhythms were organized by the regimented routines of its carceral host. Despite the potential for such intense bureaucratic structuring to displace the compassion and empathy we expect of caregiving relationships, to take too seriously the “administrative schemes for the prison [would miss] the extent and implications of slippage away from them.”¹ Instead, the bureaucratic organization of the jail’s clinical routine created gaps and possibilities for creative enactments of care that braided

N2  - Incarceration is a much more common experience for African American males than White males. As a consequence of these high rates, the "school-to-prison" pipeline is often invoked as a metaphor to capture the seemingly inexorable progression of African American boys. African American men figure so prominently in the correctional system that the number of African American 4-year-old males can be used to model the number of people who will be incarcerated 1520 years in the future. The rationale for this approach is that the more African American preschool males there are in the United States, the more prisons that will be needed when those young children become young adults. Of the approximately six hundred thousand 4-year-old African American males growing up in the United States in 2008, prisons are being planned to house 28,134 of them by 2029. These projections are a cynical representation of an unpleasant reality. The models projecting future prison populations are cynical because they are premised on the notion that the problems that contribute to the over-representation of African American males in jail will continue on their current course unchallenged and uninterrupted. These models discount the efforts of Head Start and state-funded early childhood programs, school improvement initiatives, and community-based programming. The models assume these preventive programs will make little headway in altering the developmental trajectories of African American males that propel them toward a life of incarceration. Instead, these well-intentioned efforts will be overtaken by a range of forces that impede boys' development, place them at risk of school failure, lead to delinquency, and ultimately ensnare them in lifelong involvement in the criminal justice system. Is this process inexorable? Can anything be done to improve the prospects of African American boys? I review some of the trouble spots in the developmental progression of African American boys. As a step toward identifying solutions, I discuss the conditions that give rise to the problems. Then I identify some of the steps that families, schools, and communities are taking to reverse the downward spiral of African American boys. [Copyright American Psychological Association]

N2  - In Italy, the prevalence of non-B HIV-1 subtypes ranges reportedly from 5.4% to 12.6%, yet there are no data on their circulation in prisons, where the prevalence of HIV infection is high. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the circulation of non-B subtypes and to characterize their determinants in five Italian prisons. To this end an aliquot of samples of blood was taken in the period 2001-2006 from all 262 HIV-positive inmates in whom antiretroviral treatment had failed. Complete HIV-1 PR and RT regions were sequenced for all samples and subjected to phylogenetic analysis; 250 (95.4%) sequences clustered with subtype B. The non-B subtype was found in 4% of Italian prison inmates and 16.7% of non-Italian prison inmates; the overall percentage increased from 1.8% for inmates infected in 1982-1990 to 4.4% in 1991-1999 and 21.9% in 2000-2006. Factors significantly associated with non-B subtypes were an exposure to other than injecting drug use and a first positive HIV test in 2000-2006. Non-B subtypes were distributed within five monophyletic clades. In all cases but one, it was possible to correlate the history of HIV-exposure to the origin of the clade, with high bootstrap values. In conclusion, although the sample may not be representative of the prison inmate population in Italy, the data suggest strongly that the circulation of non-B subtypes has apparently increased. Non-B subtypes were found to have been associated with heterosexual contact and time of the first HIV-positive test. Knowledge of the different subtypes circulating in prisons may be useful for tracking the epidemiology of HIV infection and for choosing antiretroviral therapy. J. Med. Virol. 80:1689-1694, 2008.

N2  - Summary Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are vaccine-preventable. Current recommendations advocate vaccination of non-immune adults at risk of exposure, including travelers to HAV or HBV endemic areas, individuals with high risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection, and some correctional facility inmates. We review the use of an accelerated schedule to administer the combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix® ). Administering three doses over three weeks and a fourth at 12 months provides rapid initial protection of most individuals for whom the standard 6-month vaccination schedule would not be suitable, including last-minute travelers and short-term correctional facility inmates. Furthermore, we consider the role of a universal vaccination strategy in preventing the spread of HAV and HBV.

N2  - US prison inmates are disproportionately indigent young men of color. These individuals are severely affected by HIV/AIDS, largely owing to the high-risk behavior that they engage in prior to incarceration.
Researchers and practitioners have issued a call for the importance of offering HIV prevention services in prison settings. However, this call has largely been ignored.
In this article, we outline reasons why these recommendations have been largely ignored, discuss innovative HIV prevention programs that are currently being implemented in prison settings, and offer recommendations for securing support for HIV prevention services in correctional settings.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of urethral chlamydia and gonorrhea in males in a correctional facility in Ontario, Canada, and to explore risk factors for infection. Methods: Between June and December, 2009, 500 adult males who had been newly admitted at a correctional facility in southern Ontario completed a survey of risk factors and provided a urine sample for testing. Those who tested positive were treated and their names were provided to the local public health unit for follow-up including contact tracing. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for infection with chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, and a multivariable model was used to look at risk factors for infection. Results: The study population reported high levels of sexual risk behaviours and drug use. The overall chlamydia prevalence was 2.9% (95% CI 1.6-4.8) and the overall gonorrhea prevalence was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1-1.8). Rates were particularly high for chlamydia in younger males, at 16% (95% CI 4.5-36) in 18-19 year olds and 3.7% (95% CI 1.0-9.3) in 20-24 year olds, and for gonorrhea in males aged 20-24 at 1.9% (95% CI 0.2-6.6). A multivariable logistic regression model revealed that though not statistically significant, younger age was associated with infection. Conclusion: The relatively high prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea found in this study suggests that primary and secondary prevention programs should be instituted for males in correctional facilities, in particular among younger inmates. Further research is required to ensure internal and external generalizability of these results, as well as to determine the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions. Objectifs : Déterminer la prevalence de la chlamydiose urétra le et de la gonorrhée dans la population masculine d'un établissement de correction en Ontario, au Canada, et étudier les facteurs de risque d'infection. Méthode : Entre juin et décembre 2009, nous avons administré un sondage sur les facteurs de risque à 500 hommes adultes nouvellement incarcérés dans un établissement de correction du Sud de l'Ontario et nous leur avons prélevé un échantillon d'urine. Ceux dont le test de dépistage était positif ont été traités, et leurs noms ont été fournis au bureau de santé publique local à des fins de suivi, y compris pour le retraçage des contacts. Nous avons calculé la prévalence et les intervalles de confiance de 95 % pour l'infection à Chlamydia et la gonorrhée, respectivement, et utilisé un modèle multivarié pour examiner les facteurs de risque d'infection. Résultats : La population à l'étude a déclaré de hauts niveaux de comportements sexuels à risque et de consommation de drogue. La prévalence globale de la chlamydiose était de 2,9 % (IC de 95 %=1,6-4,8), et la prévalence globale de la gonorrhée, de 0,6 % (IC de 95 %=0,1-1,8). Des taux de chlamydiose particulièrement élevés ont été observés chez les jeunes hommes, soit de 16 % (IC de 95 %=4,5-36) chez les 18-19 ans et de 3,7 % (IC de 95 %=1,0-9,3) chez les 20-24 ans, et des taux élevés de gonorrhée ont été observés chez les hommes de 20-24 ans, à 1,9 % (IC de 95 %=0,2-6,6). Selon notre modèle de régression logistique multivariée, la jeunesse était associée à l'infection, mais pas de manière significative. Conclusion : La prévalence relativement élevée de la chlamydiose et de la gonorrhée observée dans notre étude donne à penser qu'il faudrait instituer des programmes de prévention primaire et secondaire pour la population masculine des établissements de correction, en particulier les jeunes détenus. Il faudrait pousser la recherche pour veiller à la généralisabilité interne et externe de ces résultats et pour déterminer le rapport coût-efficacité des interventions possibles.

N2  - Compared to the general population, an excess of psychotic illnesses, major depression and dependence disorders among prisoners has been reported. However, the impact of prison on detainees’ psychopathology has rarely been studied.
To determine the mental disorders liable to develop or regress on entry into prison and over time.
Two samples of French prisoners detained in local prisons were interviewed using the same methodology. The first sample consisted of 267 new arrivals. The second was a random sample of 450 prisoners. Diagnoses were assessed using a thorough methodology: each prisoner was interviewed for approximately 2hours by two clinicians. One of the clinicians used a structured clinical interview, which generates DSM IV diagnoses (MINI plus v 5.0); the second completed the procedure with an open clinical interview. The final DSM IV diagnoses were obtained as a consensus between the two approaches. Multilevel logistic regressions were used to take into account potential confounders.
Prevalence rates of mental disorders were substantially higher in prison even for the sample of newcomers (major depression disorder: 24.7%, substance dependence: 17.6% and schizophrenia: 4.1%). Alcohol dependence disorder was significantly more frequent in the sample of newcomers (OR 1.84 [1.01–3.51]). No significant difference was evidenced between samples for substance dependence disorder. Psychotic disorders were significantly less frequent at entry into prison, particularly delusional disorder (OR 0.29 [0.08–0.98]).
This study shows the contrasted potential effects of prison on psychopathology: alcohol dependence disorders were significantly more frequent for the newcomers, while the frequency of delusional disorders was lower. This evidence is arguing in favour of the validity of the old concept: prison psychosis. Moreover, prisoners should receive relevant help from clinicians to cope with these disorders.
Un excès de maladies psychotiques (dépression et troubles de la dépendance, principalement) a été rapporté chez les personnes emprisonnées par rapport à la population générale. Toutefois, l’impact de la prison sur la pathopsychologie des détenus a été rarement étudié.
Déterminer quels sont les troubles mentaux qui sont susceptibles d’augmenter ou de régresser à l’entrée en prison et selon la durée de l’incarcération.
Deux échantillons de prisonniers français détenus dans des maisons d’arrêt ont été interviewés en utilisant une méthodologie identique. Le premier échantillon comportait 267 nouveaux arrivants. Le second était un échantillon aléatoire de 450 détenus. Les diagnostics ont été posés à l’aide d’une méthodologie éprouvée : chaque prisonnier a suivi un entretien avec deux cliniciens durant deux heures. Un des cliniciens a utilisé un questionnaire standardisé qui produit des diagnostics de type DSM IV (MINI plus V 5.0) ; le second clinicien a complété la procédure avec un entretien clinique ouvert. Le diagnostic final a été obtenu par un consensus entre les deux approches. Des régressions logistiques multiples ont été utilisées afin de prendre en compte les facteurs de confusion potentiels.
La prévalence des troubles mentaux en prison est nettement plus élevée que celle de la population générale, cela même pour les nouveaux arrivants (trouble dépressif majeur : 24,7% ; trouble de la dépendance : 17,6% et schizophrénie : 4,1%). Les troubles de la dépendance à l’alcool sont significativement plus fréquents dans l’échantillon de nouveaux arrivants (OR 1,84 [1,01–3,51]). Aucune différence significative n’a été mise en évidence pour les troubles de la dépendance aux substances. Les troubles psychotiques sont significativement moins fréquents à l’entrée en prison, notamment les troubles délirants (OR 0,29 [0,08–0,98]).
Cette étude montre le contraste des effets de l’emprisonnement sur la psychopathologie–les troubles de la dépendance sont significativement plus fréquents pour les nouveaux arrivants quand la fréquence des troubles délirants est moins fréquente. Les détenus pourraient recevoir une aide adaptée pour soulager ces pathologies.

N2  - We analyzed incarcerated men’s perceptions of and experiences with HIV testing. Interviews were conducted with 105 men, aged 18 to 29 years, in 4 states. Most men had received an HIV test while incarcerated because it was convenient or free or because they thought it was mandatory. At most sites, men believed they were HIV-negative because they never received test results. Some men did not know the diseases for which they had been tested. Some men avoided HIV testing outside prison because they lacked time, lacked resources, feared knowing the results, or perceived themselves to not be at risk.
HIV testing programs for young men inside or outside prison should address barriers to HIV testing, communicate the meaning and extent of testing, and improve notification of those with HIV-negative results.

N2  - The approximately 1.2 million inmates in U.S. correctional institutions have a high prevalence of communicable diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus infection, and gonorrhea. Before their incarceration, most inmates had limited access to health care, which, together with poor compliance because of lifestyle, made them difficult to identify and treat in the general community. Because of the high yearly turnover (approximately 800% and 50% in jails and prisons, respectively), the criminal justice system can play an important public health role both during incarceration and in the immediate postrelease period. A public policy agenda for criminal justice should include an epidemiologic orientation, as well as resources for education, counseling, early detection, and treatment. Taking advantage of the period of confinement would serve both the individual and society by controlling communicable diseases in large urban communities.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In August 2001, a cluster of MRSA skin infections was detected in a correctional facility. AD investigation was conducted to determine its cause and to prevent further MRSA infections.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: A 200-bed detention center.
PATIENTS: A case was defined as a detainee with a skin lesion from which MRSA was cultured from July 24 through December 31, 2001. Case-patients were identified by review of laboratory culture results and by skin lesion screening through point-prevalence survey and admission examination. Controls were randomly selected from an alphabetized list of detainees.
INTERVENTION: Medical staff implemented measures to improve skin disease screening, personal hygiene, wound care, and antimicrobial therapy.
RESULTS: Sixteen cases were identified: 11, 5, and 0 in the preintervention, peri-intervention, and postintervention periods, respectively Seven case-patients and 19 controls were included in the case-control study. On multivariable analysis, working as a dormitory orderly (OR, 9.8; CI95 0.74-638; P = .10) and a stay of longer than 36 days (OR 6.9; CI95, 0.65-128.2; P = .14) were the strongest predictors for MRSA skin infection. The preintervention, peri-intervention, and postintervention MRSA infection rates were 11.6, 8.8, and 0 per 10,000 detainee-days, respectively. The rate of MRSA skin infections declined significantly between both the preintervention and peri-intervention periods and the postintervention period (P < .01 for both comparisons).
CONCLUSIONS: MRSA skin disease can become an emergent problem in a correctional facility Interventions targeted at skin disease screening, appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and hygiene may decrease the risk of acquiring MRSA infection in correctional facilities.

N2  - Suicide prevention training for the prison service in England and Wales has been criticized. STORM is a package emphasizing the practice and review of interactions with suicidal persons and was evaluated in a pilot study for use in prisons. Trainees completed questionnaires immediately before and after training and at 6 to 8 months follow‐up. Training significantly improved attitudes, knowledge, and confidence, and improvements were maintained at follow‐up. Satisfaction with training was very high. STORM was successfully adapted for prison settings, and showed good effects among staff trained. It should be provided to the wider prison estate, with regular refresher training.

N2  - Three indicators derived from the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) Alcohol Problems scale (ALC)-tolerance/high consumption, loss of control, and negative social and psychological consequences-were subjected to taxometric analysis-mean above minus below a cut (MAMBAC), maximum covariance (MAXCOV), and latent mode factor analysis (L-Mode)-in 1,374 federal prison inmates (905 males, 469 females). Whereas the total sample yielded ambiguous results, the male subsample produced dimensional results, and the female subsample produced taxonic results. Interpreting these findings in light of previous taxometric research on alcohol abuse and dependence it is speculated that while alcohol use disorders may be taxonic in female offenders, they are probably both taxonic and dimensional in male offenders. Two models of male alcohol use disorder in males are considered, one in which the diagnostic features are categorical and the severity of symptomatology is dimensional, and one in which some diagnostic features (e.g., withdrawal) are taxonic and other features (e.g., social problems) are dimensional.

N2  - We examined AIDS stigma among male inmates and male and female staff at a state prison in the southern region of the USA. Inmates and staff rated people with AIDS more negatively than someone with other diseases (diabetes, cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure). Inmates and staff were concerned about being treated differently if they tested seropositive. They also described AIDS stigma as a barrier to seeking HIV testing. Both instrumental (inaccurate beliefs about casual contact causing transmission of the virus) and symbolic factors (negative attitudes about injection drug use) predicted AIDS stigma. Negative attitudes about homosexuality predicted AIDS stigma among Caucasian prison staff and inmates, but not among African American staff and inmates. The results indicate the need to address HIV/AIDS stigma in developing HIV treatment, care and prevention programs in the prison environment.

N2  - Objective: To assess the proportion of seropositivity of Hepatitis C amongst the prison inmates in the jails of Sindh.
Methods: A cross sectional HCV seroprevalence survey was done at 14 out of 19 prisons in the Sindh province from November 2008 to January 2009. A team of Pathologist, phlebotomist and laboratory technician took the blood sample of the inmates inside the correctional facility; the blood was centrifuged at the spot and brought back to the pathology laboratory on same day in cold chain i.e. a temperature-controlled supply chain. Serum was analyzed on 3rd generation ELISA for HCV antibodies. Standard ethical considerations were properly followed.
Results: A total of 9508 prison inmates were approached. Refusal rate was 20%. Remaining, 7539 prisoners were screened at 14 out of 19 jails in Sindh. HCV antibody positive were 965 making the proportion of seropositivity 12.8% (95% C.I. 8.92% - 12.92%). Higher seropositivity in the jails of northern Sindh jails was identified.
Conclusions: Hepatitis C prevalence in the prison population of Sindh is higher than the national prevalence of 4.9% amongst general population. However it is lower than that reported from correctional facilities of developed countries. Hepatitis prevention and control activities in the correctional facilities of Pakistan need to be institutionalized (JPMA 60:476; 2010).

N2  - This study aimed to evaluate the less stigmatizing positivity construct screening measurement and its association with recent self-harming behaviors among adolescents. Participants were 193 detained Taiwanese adolescents. Questionnaires consisted of a deliberate self-harm inventory, a positivity construct measurement, a depression scale, data concerning risky health behaviors and demographics. The prevalence rate of recent self-harming behavior among adolescents in the detention house was 43.5%. The logistic model showed that age, gender and level of positivity demonstrated significant odds ratios for self-harm behavior. Results showed that younger age and female gender increased self-harming behavior. In addition, low score on positivity construct screening measurement increased the probability of self-harming behavior. Furthermore, these adolescents also engaged in risky health behaviors and were more depressed. Parental and school awareness for these risky behaviors should be enhanced and appropriate early interventions implemented to prevent negative health outcomes.

N2  - Cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest induce a systemic inflammatory response, including a cascade of leukocyte and endothelial cell activity, during the postischemic reperfusion phase. Accumulation of leukocytes in the brain can lead to neurologic problems after cardiac surgery. The beneficial effects of a leukocyte-depleting filter have been documented, but because of contradictory results the underlying function of the filter remains unclear.
Twenty-two juvenile piglets (6 to 8 weeks) were randomly assigned to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass with or without a leukocyte-depleting filter 60 minutes before and 60 minutes after a 75-minute hypothermic circulatory arrest at 18°C. The cerebral vessels were visualized with intravital microscopy through a cranial window placed over the parietal cortex. Rhodamine staining was used to observe adherent and rolling leukocytes in the cerebral postcapillary venules. The animals were electively killed 1 hour after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.
There were no significant differences between the study groups regarding hemodynamic data. Numbers of adherent activated leukocytes were lower in the leukocyte filtration group, reaching borderline statistical significance when assessed throughout the experiment (between-groups
P = .069) and actual statistical significance when assessed during the rewarming period (between-groups
P = .029).
The leukocyte-depleting filter succeeded in reducing the number of adherent leukocytes during the reperfusion period in an experimental operation with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Such a filter thus could mitigate cerebral reperfusion injury after cardiac surgery.

N2  - Background  The social climate of inpatient facilities is thought to be an important contributor to treatment outcome. However, little research has focused on this construct within secure forensic services for people with intellectual disabilities (ID). Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the social climate of two different types of secure units (‘low’ secure vs. ‘medium’ secure) contained within the same facility for offenders with ID. Two hypotheses were generated: (1) residents would rate the social climate of the whole facility in a more negative direction than staff, and (2) residents and staff would rate the social climate of the ‘low’ secure unit in a more positive direction than that of the ‘medium’ secure unit.
Method  Using a 2 (factor ‘Participant’ = Staff or Resident) × 2 (factor ‘Unit’ = ‘Low’ or ‘Medium’ Secure Unit) between‐subjects design, 18 residents and 37 staff members were recruited and completed the Correctional Institutions Environment Scale (CIES), a measure of social climate.
Results  Residents tended to rate the units in a more positive direction than staff on some sub‐scales. Participants rated the ‘low’ secure unit in a more positive direction than the ‘medium’ secure unit on two sub‐scales of the CIES. However, on selected sub‐scales there were differences. The findings of this study suggest that the CIES may be a valid instrument for use within forensic services for people with ID, and further suggests that residents and staff have different perceptions of the shared social climate, which may have implications for service development.

N2  - We assessed methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and colonization in hospitalized prisoners. Of 434 admission surveillance cultures, 58 (13%) were positive for MRSA. The sensitivity of admission surveillance cultures of samples from the anterior nares was 72% and increased to 84% when the calculation included cultures of wound samples. Hospitalized prisoners are at high risk for MRSA infection and colonization, and surveillance should include cultures of nares and wound samples.

N2  - We sought to estimate the number of arrestees at risk for inadequately treated drug and alcohol withdrawal in US jails. We used Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program data to estimate prevalence rates of alcohol and opiate dependence. Our results revealed rates of alcohol and opiate dependency among arrestees of approximately 12% and 4%, respectively; only 28% of jail administrators reported that their institutions had ever detoxified arrestees. Inadequately treated drug and alcohol withdrawal in US jails appears widespread. Our data raise important ethical and constitutional questions.

N2  - Background Systemic distribution of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) after intracoronary infusion (ICI) and the role of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cell distribution still remain unclear. This study was designed o analyze the cell distribution after ICI in variations of heart status in a swine myocardial infarction model. Materials and methods After inducing a myocardial infarction, iron oxide labeled male cells (1 × 108 ) were infused through the coronary artery of the beating swine heart in Group 1. In Group 2, CPB was set up and then the same volume of cells was infused after cardioplegic arrest. In Groups 3 and 4, the animals underwent either beating or arrested ICI with the same volume of saline. Three days later, cell distribution was assessed by T2* change with magnetic resonance imaging and sex-determining region on Y-chromosome with quantitive polymerase chain reaction. Results Only a few transplanted cells were localized in the heart and no difference was found between Groups 1 and 2. The majority of BMSCs would be trapped in extracardial organs, and more cells resided in the spleen in arrested heart status. Conclusions The majority of BMSCs transplanted by ICI would be entrapped by the extracardial organs. The arrested heart with CPB during ICI does not favor more cell retention in the injured myocardium. The optimal approach of delivery of BMSCs still needs further investigation.

N2  - The objective of this study was to provide trained labor support (doulas) to pregnant women in jail. A multiagency intervention project provided doula birth services to pregnant women in urban jails. Program evaluation included interviews with women and written satisfaction surveys of providers and correctional officers. A convenience sample of 18 incarcerated women received doula services. A doula visited each woman in jail antepartum to review expectations for labor and birth; during hospitalization, the doula provided continuous support throughout labor and birth. Doulas visited women postpartum to review birth events. Surveys administered to providers and officers demonstrated high satisfaction with the program. Qualitative interviews with 14 women indicated unanimous support for the services and documented women's major concerns. Findings support offering doula services to all pregnant women in custody and expanding doula services to include early and comprehensive intervention coordinated by nurses.

N2  - Objectives: This paper reports on a review of suicides in New South Wales (NSW) prisons from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2005 in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the nature and quality of the problem of suicide among prisoners.
Method: All deaths in NSW prisons for the period were reviewed. Those identified as self-inflicted, with a coronial finding of death by suicide or those awaiting a coronial hearing but reported as possible death by suicide were included. A data set was collected on each case and entered into a database.
Results: A total of 92 cases were identified as deaths by suicide in NSW prisons from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2005, representing 41% of all deaths in custody for the period.
Conclusion: The rate of suicide in NSW prisons has been declining over the past 10 years, but remains approximately 10-fold that of the NSW community. Suicide was the leading cause of death among NSW inmates from 1995 to 2005. Suicide is a rare event, making its prediction a difficult task, with the prison environment a further compounding factor. This review highlights a number of factors, which appear to be common in many cases. Increased monitoring during the first week of incarceration may be an effective intervention. It is recommended that consideration be given to the length of time spent on remand and the value of custodial sentences of ≤6 months.

N2  - Directly observed therapy (DOT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly used in correctional settings; however, the efficacy of DOT for treating HIV infection has not been determined. We prospectively assessed adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens among 31 HIV-infected prison inmates who were receiving ≤1 antiretrovirals via DOT. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill count, electronic monitoring caps, and, for DOT only, medication administration records. Overall, median adherence was 90%, as measured by pill count; 86%, by electronic monitoring caps; and 100%, by self-report. Adherence, as measured by electronic monitoring caps, was >90% in 32% of the subjects. In 91% of cases, adherence, as measured by medication administration records, was greater than that recorded by electronic monitoring caps for the same medications administered by DOT. Objective methods of measurement revealed that adherence to antiretroviral regimens administered wholly or in part by DOT was ≥90% in more than one-half of the patients. Different methods used to measure adherence revealed significantly different levels of adherence. These findings suggest that use of DOT does not ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy.

N2  - Abstract Objective This study aimed to compare the dilemmas of using organs from prisoners with death penalties (PDP) from the perspectives of organ transplant health professionals (OTHP) from Taiwan (TW) and Mainland China (MC). Materials and Methods A purposive sample including TW's OTHP (including transplant surgeons, nurses, researchers, social workers, and medical religious and legal experts), and MC's OTHP (including surgeons and nurses) was obtained in this qualitative research. TW's subjects received face-to-face interviews, and MC's subjects received telephone interviews due to limited communication opportunities. Data were analyzed by content analysis. Results A total of 105 subjects participated in this project (TW n = 99, MC n = 6). They were surgeons (n = 18: TW n = 14, MC n = 4), registered nurses (n = 42: TW n = 40, MC n = 2), OT coordinating nurses (n = 10 TW), OT researchers (n = 5 TW), social workers (n = 10 TW), medical religious experts (n = 15 TW), and medical legal experts (n = 5 TW). The following 8 ethical dilemmas were reported: (1) questionable legitimacy of PDP motivation (TW 100%, MC 100%); (2) recipients' worries about public discrimination (TW 89%, MC 50%); (3) difficulties in approaching PDP (TW 100%); (4) hesitation of HP and volunteers in helping PDP (TW 37%); (5) questionable social contribution of PDP as donor sources (TW 32%); (6) complex legal details of PDP issues (TW 26%); (7) potential threat from PDP families (TW 23%); and (8) difficulties in helping PDP families cope with post-organ donation syndrome (TW 11%). Conclusions Five suggestions were developed in managing these challenges: (1) TW OTHP may empower their basic social science knowledge and empirical competence; (2) TW government may form a task force wherein OTHP leaders are encouraged to foster interdisciplinary collaborations with the public within short-, mid-, and long-term time frames; (3) TW and MC may establish evidence-based center(s) to provide systematic literature reviews for clinical guidance, policy making, and educational resources; (4) TW and MC may try to improve the quality of PDP organ harvesting and donation practice in jails/health institutes; and (5) TW and MC may develop reliable communication systems to share experiences of quality care for PDP, and to evaluate the appraisals both pro and con from multidisciplinary societies and the public, if available.

N2  - The survival rates of gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) have improved as the clinicopathological concept and practice guidelines for treating GIP, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome have improved as well as organsupporting systems.1 However, we often encounter patients with GIP who have already fallen into septic shock or cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). During CPR, the systolic blood pressure is not beyond 60 to 80 mmHg and the average carotid pressure is not beyond 40 mmHg.4 We should do CPR blindly before ROSC for patients with GIP with CPA as poor candidates for surgery before ROSC, even if the cause of the CPA is recognized as GIP and the treatment for peritonitis potentially improves the unstable circulatory and metabolic condition.

N2  - The goal of this study is to describe the establishment of an HIV testing and treatment programme in the Jamaican correctional system and to estimate the prevalence of HIV/sexually transmitted disease (STD) among adult incarcerated men in this country. A demonstration project was implemented by the Jamaican Department of Correctional Services and Ministry of Health in the nation's largest correctional centre. All inmates were offered HIV and syphilis testing, and a subset was offered chlamydia, gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis testing. Cross-sectional data from the project were reviewed to determine the prevalence and correlates of HIV/STD. HIV test acceptance was 63% for voluntary testers (n = 1200). The prevalence of HIV was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33–4.64) (n = 1017) and the prevalence syphilis was 0.7% (95% CI 0.29–1.49) (n = 967). Among the subset tested (n = 396) the prevalence of chlamydia was 2.5% (95% CI 1.22–4.49) and for trichomoniasis it was 1.8% (95% CI 0.01–3.60), but no cases of gonorrhoea were detected (n = 396). The prevalence of HIV was significantly higher at 25% (95% CI 13.64–39.60) for persons located in a separate section where individuals labelled as men who have sex with men (MSM) are separated. HIV/STD testing is important and feasible in Jamaica. A special focus should be placed on providing services to inmates labelled as MSM. Other Caribbean nations may also benefit from similar programmes.

N2  - A longitudinal study of demographic and behavioural characteristics associated with risky sexual behaviours of young men after release from prison. One hundred and six men were interviewed in prison and at one week and six months after release. Overall, 37% reported a previous sexually transmitted disease (STD) diagnosis. In the 30 days before incarceration, 33% had had sex with a risky partner, and 59% had had multiple female sex partners. After release, 38 (36%) men reported having had risky sex (≥2 female sex partners and unprotected vaginal sex): 12 (13%) at one week and 31 (34%) at six months. The only factor independently associated with risky sex was the use of alcohol/drugs before sex: one-week odds ratio (OR)=6.11 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.42-26.40), six-month OR=3.05 (95% CI: 1.30-9.42). Behavioural intervention programmes for incarcerated men should address drug and alcohol use and its contribution to higher risk for HIV and STDs.

N2  - The current study examined gender differences in personal and psychological characteristics among drug-abstinent Israeli inmates. The study fo cuses primarily on three personal variables: sense of coherence (SOC), anxiety, and hostility. Additional factors that were examined are demographic variables, which include background, crime, and drug addiction. The sample included 119 inmates (65 males and 54 females) who abstained from drugs use for two different time intervals-up to one year, and more than one year-and did not receive treatment. Overall, males and females shared similar backgrounds except for a higher rate of sexual abuse among female inmates. No gender differences were found in recidivism. These findings show that drug-addicted female inmates injected drugs to a greater extent than males. They also indicated that male inmates remained abstinent for longer periods than female inmates. Additionally, length of abstinence was related to higher SOC, lower trait anxiety, and less hostility among male inmates compared to female inmates. Among female inmates, length of abstinence was related to lower SOC, higher trait anxiety, and no change in hostility. These findings may indicate the need to require separate gender-oriented therapeutic interventions.

N2  - Previous studies have implicated antisocial personality disorder in criminal behavior, but little is known about the association between “normal” personality dimensions and arrest. We investigated the relationships between these personality dimensions and prior arrest in a sample of adults participating in a longitudinal epidemiological study. Between 1993 and 1999, psychiatrists re-examined subjects who were originally interviewed in Baltimore in 1981 as part of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study; the psychiatrists diagnosed axis I and axis II disorders according to DSM-IV criteria. A total of 611 subjects also completed the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), which assesses five broad factors and 30 facets of normal personality. History of criminal arrest in Maryland in the period 1981 to 1993 was determined from the state criminal justice database. Student’s
t test and logistic regression were used to evaluate relationships between NEO personality scores and prior arrest. Controlling for demographic characteristics, alcohol or drug use disorders, and DSM-IV personality disorder scores, the odds of prior arrest increased with scores on angry hostility, impulsiveness, and excitement-seeking dimensions. Prior arrest was inversely related to scores on trust, straightforwardness, compliance, modesty, dutifulness, and deliberation dimensions. The results suggest that specific dimensions of normal personality are related to criminal arrest in the community.

N2  - Objectives:
To determine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, the degree of psychiatric comorbidity, and the relationship between these and sociodemographic variables in a sample of incarcerated adolescents. A comparison with an age- and sex-matched community sample was conducted.
Method:
Age- and sex-matched samples of 49 incarcerated adolescents and 49 nondelinquents were compared for psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial characteristics. Psychiatric diagnoses were determined using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-Revised (DICA-R). Additional information on psychosocial, family, and offence characteristics was obtained using a semistructured interview designed specifically for this study. The prevalence of single and comorbid psychiatric disorders was determined.
Results:
Approximately 63.3% of incarcerated adolescents had 2 or more psychiatric disorders. The degree of psychiatric morbidity was directly related to indicators of family adversity, physical abuse, other psychosocial variables, or polysubstance abuse. Psychiatric comorbidity was more frequent in females. Incarcerated adolescents were more likely to endorse symptoms of thought disorder.
Conclusions:
Findings identify preventive intervention foci for policy makers and planners in the area of adolescent corrections. Implications for education and training of nonclinical custodial staff are discussed as is the need for a more therapeutic orientation in correctional facilities.

N2  - This introduction presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book explores the notion of prison letters and the archive of booklets in which they are contained as a liminal counter-carceral space. It explains the writers and their identities within the codified spaces of prisons. The book explores the different nature of prison and the concept of incarceration, the use of space and time as dimensions for the observation of social and power relationships. It describes the construction of the enemy and the sensationalised uses of crime and criminal phenomena. The book explores the specific regimes and seeks to understand some general tendencies in prison governmentality, starting from the strategies of differentiation. It explains videoconferencing as the new technology that bites the soul of prisoners instead of their flesh.

N2  - This article summarizes the results of the Transition Research on Adjudicated Youth in Community Settings (TRACS) project, a 5-year longitudinal study that examined the facility-to-community transition of 531 incarcerated youth (58% had a disability) from Oregon's juvenile justice system. About 40% of the sample returned to the juvenile correctional system within 12 months after release. Only 47% were engaged in work or school at 6 months after release, and 31% were engaged at 12 months after release. Participants who were engaged in work or school at 6 months after release tended to stay involved in those positive activities at 12 months after release and not return to the juvenile correctional system. These results point to the importance of providing interventions focused toward work and school placements immediately upon youths' release from the juvenile correctional system and their return to the community.

N2  - This study investigated the relationship between bullying and aggression among imprisoned male adult offenders. The participants were 70 imprisoned male offenders, who were classified using the Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behaviour Checklist (DIPC) as one of four ‘bully’ groups: pure bully, pure victim, bully/victim, or not involved. Participants also completed the Buss‐Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ), a measure of aggression and hostility. The majority of the prisoners reported behaviors indicative of bullying, with 42.9 percent classified in the bully/victim group and 12.9 percent as pure bullies. 15.7 percent of participants were classified as pure victims, while 28.6 percent did not report any involvement in bullying. Bully/victims scored higher than participants who were not involved in bullying on the Hostility scale and Total score of the AQ. A number of correlations were found between the AQ scores and number of bully behaviors perpetrated. These suggested there is an overlap between the constructs measured by the AQ and type of bullying behaviors perpetrated. The number of bullying behaviors experienced was only correlated with the Hostility scale. The results are discussed in terms of previous research and their implications for theory and practice.

N2  - N-Benzylpiperazine was tested in the beginning of the 1970s as a possible antidepressant drug. However, in both animal and human studies, it was shown to possess amphetamine-like properties, and any further studies were stopped. In a forensic autopsy case in 1999, we found a substance so far unknown to us in the chromatogram of our method used for amphetamines. We could swiftly identify this compound as N-benzylpiperazine because of information given to us by a newly formed network comprising, among others, customs and the police. Since then, we have found N-benzylpiperazine in several cases, among them 11 cases from a number of prisons.

N2  - Myotonic dystrophy (MD) is an autosomal dominant disorder which affects both smooth and skeletal muscles.1 The incidence is approximately 1 in 8,000 births. It is the most common muscular dystrophy to manifest in adulthood, and the second most common skeletal muscle disorder after Duchenne MD. Cardiac rhythm disturbances are a common cause of death in these patients. This lesson describes a case in which a previously undiagnosed case of MD presented with an episode of ventricular fibrillation.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess trends in Chlamydia trachomatis positivity and associated risk factors among detained female adolescents. Goal: The goal of this study was to determine trends in prevalence of chlamydia among detained female adolescents. Study Design: We retrospectively reviewed risk factor data and chlamydia results collected by providers during 1998-2002 at four large juvenile detention centers in Washington State that routinely screen female adolescents for C. trachomatis. Results: Of 3,593 tests, a total of 493 (13.7%) were positive for chlamydia. High chlamydia positivity was sustained throughout the 5-year period (range, 12.5-15.0%) with no statistically significant trends in positivity. Independent risk factors for chlamydial infection included report of more than one sex partner in the previous 60 days (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-2.04) and previous chlamydial infection within 12 months (adjusted OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.45-2.40). Conclusions: Efforts are needed to promote chlamydia screening programs in juvenile detention centers because these sites have access to high-risk sexually active female adolescents.

N2  - This study aimed to examine rates of mental illness and suicidal ideation in a random sample of prisoners in four UK prisons, and to examine the characteristics and quality of care received by prisoners identified as at current risk of suicide/self harm. Methods used were: cross-sectional study of mental illness and suicidal ideation in a random sample of prisoners, and in all prisoners specifically managed as a suicide risk; examination of suicide risk care plans; and comparative study of information sharing across suicide risk and healthcare documentation. Results showed that prisoners identified as at risk of suicide/self harm had significantly higher rates of clinically significant symptoms of mental illness, as measured by a standardized instrument, than the general prison population. There was a high level of suicide risk that had not been identified. Problems with the delivery of planned care interventions were revealed and little congruence was found between systems of documentation. The suicide care planning system was correctly targeting a proportion of those at risk but high levels of unmet need remained. The care planning and information sharing processes within prisons and between prisons and other agencies should be improved.

N2  - Background and Objectives: To assess STD prevalence among a sample of incarcerated minority male youth in a southern US city. Methods: A consecutive entrant, cross-sectional study of 284 minority males 14 to 18 years was performed. All adolescents were screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia using ligase chain reaction tests. Results: Eighteen percent of youth were identified as having either gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both. Approximately 84% of those with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) self-reported having no symptoms. Failure to use condoms in the past month was significantly associated with a positive test result for STDs (odds ratio = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.3). Conclusions: The findings indicate an urgent need for routine STD screening and STD-prevention programs for adolescent males in detention facilities. A study of 284 detained black male adolescents revealed 18% prevalence of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or both. Approximately 84% of those with sexually transmitted diseases self-reported not having symptoms.

N2  - Objectives. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States has increased dramatically over the last two decades, largely because of an increase in the number of people with advanced hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. U.S. prisoners are at high risk for HCC, given their elevated rates of HCV infection, comorbid hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and alcoholic liver disease. The purpose of our study was to examine the prevalence and mortality of HCC in the nation's largest state prison system. Methods. The study population consisted of 325,477 male Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) inmates who were incarcerated between January 1, 2003, and July 31, 2006. Information on medical conditions and demographic characteristics was obtained from an institution-wide medical information system. Results. During the 3.5-year study period, 176 male TDCJ inmates (54 per 100,000) were diagnosed with HCC and 108 (33 per 100,000) died as a result of HCC. Inmates who were Hispanic, older, and infected with HCV, HBV, or human immunodeficiency virus had elevated rates of both HCC prevalence and mortality. After adjusting for all study covariates, HCC prevalence, but not mortality, was modestly elevated among inmates with diabetes. Conclusions. Our study showed that the Texas male prison population had a sevenfold higher prevalence of HCC than the general U.S. male population and a fourfold higher death rate from HCC. These findings likely reflect the high concentration of HCC-related risk factors, particularly HCV, among prisoners.

N2  - This chapter reflects on two distinct activations of popularly imagined catastrophes: Pigeonblog directs its efforts at increasing pollution and the precarity (and potential toxicity) of the biological bodies that occupy and compose our urban ecologies. Governments and corporations involved in the surveillance of bodies, on the other hand, offer the (albeit false) promise of regulation and preemption of catastrophe: their narrative about the technology they use obfuscates the potential of revolt and disorder, even of waste, in favor of techno-capitalist efficiency. The efficiency companies and governments sell is entirely dependent on the perpetuation of an imagined future catastrophe that must always remain on the horizon but can never, in fact, arrive. Commercial, actuarial, and carceral surveillance works toward biocapitalization, which offers the promise of preventing an imagined future catastrophe as the very mechanism by which to obscure the real catastrophes that its methods perpetuate: the extraction of capital from life on the ground, at the expense of both the bodies it tracks and the ecologies in which it acts. Both the tracking done by Pigeonblog and commercial and state entities use similar technologies to track their targets. Their employment of these technologies, however, works to contrasting ends with regard to the future catastrophe they imagine, and differently articulate the spaces in which they operate. Pigeonblog posits an ongoing destructive process and records its unfolding. The state imagines a future catastrophe it promises to prevent from materializing. The real potency of da Costa's project is in the way it subverts the very myths that surveillance needs in order to operate: perfect knowledge of a wholly readable city. As I will show, Pigeonblog converts the chaos that it finds on the other side of this fantasy - the messy, risky, and imprecise stuff of urban life - into an opportunity for more productive practical action against the power of the status quo, driven as that regime is by its desire to convert the life it manages into biocapital.
Pigeonblog directs its efforts at increasing pollution and the precarity of the biological bodies that occupy and compose our urban ecologies. Governments and corporations involved in the surveillance of bodies, on the other hand, offer the promise of regulation and preemption of catastrophe: their narrative about the technology they use obfuscates the potential of revolt and disorder, even of waste, in favor of techno-capitalist efficiency. The tracking tools used by Pigeonblog, and those used for commercial and carceral surveillance, require a particular set of infrastructures to do their work. Pigeonblog and its counterexample in the work of surveillance produce competing temporal framing for the catastrophic. Pigeonblog, though obliquely, understands catastrophe as unfolding within bodies and ecologies as an ongoing processual phenomenon, not an event. Pigeonblog and surveillance are situated within the complicated relationship between the global and the local, itself charged by competing discourses about the reach of global infrastructures.

N2  - Objective: This study describes rescreening following a prison cervical cancer screening intervention: the numbers of women who received rescreening during the three-year follow-up period; their timing of rescreening in relationship to intervention follow-up recommendations; and socio-demographic factors associated with rescreening. Methods: Socio-demographic information was collected from Corrections Branch records. Clinical and risk factor information was obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. Pap screening histories were collected from Cervical Cancer Screening Program (CCSP) client records using the client ID number for Pap smears taken during the intervention period, during the three-year follow-up period, and during the 30-month period preceding the intervention period. Results were entered in Excel and responses summarized with frequency tables; bivariate analysis of categoric variables was done using chi-square tests of independence. Results: During the three-year follow-up period, only 28 (21%) of 138 women who participated in a prison cervical cancer screening intervention were rescreened within 6 months of the recommendation received at intervention Pap test. Women with fewer than 5 multiple names (aliases) were more likely to be rescreened (p=0.02). Educational level approached statistical significance (p=0.05), with women with least education receiving highest rescreening. There was no relationship between rescreening and ethnicity, injection drug use, having borne children and current methadone treatment. Conclusion: Only 50% of women who participated in a specifically designed prison screening intervention were rescreened during the subsequent three years. Further work is needed to design, implement and evaluate follow-up initiatives of community cervical cancer screening programs for women who are at higher risk of developing cervical dysplasia. Objectif : Cette étude porte sur le redépistage après une intervention de dépistage du cancer du col utérin en prison; on y précise le nombre de femmes redépistées pendant la période de suivi de trois ans; le moment du redépistage par rapport aux interventions de suivi recommandées; et les facteurs sociodémographiques associés au redépistage. Méthode : Les données sociodémographiques ont été recueillies dans les dossiers de la Direction générale des affaires correctionnelles. Les données cliniques et les facteurs de risque ont été obtenus au moyen d'un questionnaire auto-administré. Les antécédents de dépistage par frottis de Papanicolaou ont été extraits des dossiers des clientes du programme de dépistage du cancer du col utérin à l'aide du numéro d'identification des clientes, et ce, pour les frottis effectués pendant la période d'intervention; au cours de la période de suivi de trois ans; et au cours des 30 mois précédant la période d'intervention. Les résultats ont été entrés dans un tableau Excel, et les réponses, résumées dans des tableaux statistiques; l'analyse bivariée des variables de catégories a été effectuée à l'aide de tests d'indépendance du khi-carré. Résultats : Pendant la période de suivi de trois ans, 28 seulement (21 %) des 138 femmes ayant participé à l'intervention de dépistage du cancer du col utérin en prison avaient été redépistées 6 mois ou moins après la recommandation reçue lors du test de Papanicolaou d'intervention. Les femmes ayant moins de 5 pseudonymes étaient plus susceptibles d'avoir été redépistées (p=0,02). Le niveau d'instruction était proche du seuil de signification statistique (p=0.05) (les femmes les moins scolarisées affichant le plus haut taux de redépistage). Il n'y avait aucune relation entre le redépistage et l'appartenance ethnique, l'usage de drogue injectable, le fait d'avoir donné naissance, ou le fait de suivre un traitement à la méthadone. Conclusion : Seulement 50 % des femmes ayant participé à une intervention de dépistage en prison spécialement conçue avaient été redépistées au cours des trois années suivantes. Il faudrait poursuivre le travail pour concevoir, mettre en oeuvre et évaluer des initiatives de suivi des programmes communautaires de dépistage du cancer du col utérin à l'intention des femmes les plus à risque de contracter une dysplasie du col de l'utérus.

N2  - This chapter considers the critical elements leading to the success of a partnership between the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) and several Australian corrections jurisdictions. Since 2013, through the Making the Connection project, UniSQ has offered higher education programs in prisons using bespoke digital technologies, making it the largest higher education provider in Australian prisons. A particular focus was addressing the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the carceral space. Incarcerated learners are the fastest-growing cohort for UniSQ. Early on, the Making the Connection project team committed to making the initiative sustainable and scalable by using university staff already employed by the university, using existing business units and processes, and leveraging existing procurement arrangements. Fostering strong relationships was also key. Though all project personnel contributed to this aim, responsibility largely fell to two engagement leaders employed by the project. This chapter describes the critical success factors that enabled a digital higher education initiative to move from a funded project to business-as-usual.

N2  - Taiwan has experiencing an outbreak of HIV infection among injection drug users (IDUs) since 2003. A case-control study was conducted to determine the behavioral characteristics associated with HIV infection among IDUs. The study identified 120 inmates with HIV infection and 121 matched HIV-negative controls from prisons. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews. The study found 48.1% of IDUs shared needles, less than a half of IDUs reported sexual intercourse before incarceration and only 19.7% used condoms. The multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for years of heroin injection, found that HIV infection was independently associated with the use of a used needle or syringe at the latest injection (odds ratio [OR], 8.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-20.2, p<0.001), having HIV-infected relatives or friends (OR, 5.7; 95%CI, 2.5-13.2, p<0.001) and sharing containers with others (OR, 3.3; 95%CI, 1.2-8.8, p=0.02). Our findings highlight the importance of needle exchange programs along with HIV-prevention education.

N2  - Context: Mental health courts are growing in popularity as a form of jail diversion for justice system-involved people with serious mental illness. This is the first prospective multisite study on mental health courts with treatment and control groups.
Objectives: To determine if participation in a mental health court is associated with more favorable criminal justice outcomes than processing through the regular criminal court system and to identify defendants for whom mental health courts produce the most favorable criminal justice outcomes.
Design: Longitudinal study.
Setting: Four mental health courts in San Francisco County, CA, Santa Clara County, CA, Hennepin County (Minneapolis), MN, and Marion County (Indianapolis), IN.
Participants: A total 447 persons in the mental health court (MHC) and 600 treatment-as-usual (TAU) controls.
Intervention: Eighteen months of pre-entry and postentry data for 4 jurisdictions. All subjects were interviewed at baseline, and 70% were interviewed at 6 months. Objective outcome data were obtained on all subjects from Federal Bureau of Investigation arrest records, jails, prisons, and community treatment providers.
Main Outcome Measures: Annualized rearrest rates, number of rearrests, and postentry incarceration days.
Results: The MHC and TAU samples are similar on the major outcome measures in the pre-entry 18-month period. In the 18 months following treatment, defined as entry into mental health court, the MHC group has a lower annualized rearrest rate, fewer post-18-month arrests, and fewer post-18-month incarceration days than the TAU group. The MHC graduates had lower rearrest rates than participants whose participation was terminated both during MHC supervision and after supervision ended. Factors associated with better outcomes among the MHC participants include lower pre-18-month arrests and incarceration days, treatment at baseline, not using illegal substances, and a diagnosis of bipolar disorder rather than schizophrenia or depression.
Conclusions: Mental health courts meet the public safety objectives of lowering posttreatment arrest rates and days of incarceration. Both clinical and criminal justice factors are associated with better public safety outcomes for MHC participants.

N2  - Objectives: To determine risk factors for chlamydial or gonococcal urethral infection among adult male detainees at Cook County Jail. To develop a screening algorithm with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of urethral infection. Study Design: We interviewed adult male detainees and tested them for chlamydial or gonococcal urethral infection during jail intake from June 24 through July 29, 2004. We supplemented the crosssectional survey with a nested case-control study. Results: We screened 5634 (93%) of 6028 detainees; 348 (6.2%) had chlamydial or gonococcal urethral infection. Interviews were completed and collected for 35%. By multivariable analysis, infected detainees were more likely to be <31 years of age, have more than 6 sex partners in the previous 12 months, or have symptoms. Age less than 31 years or symptoms would have identified 73% of infected detainees while screening only 50%. Conclusions: A simple algorithm that included age and symptoms best identified detainees at increased risk for chlamydial or gonococcal urethral infection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess and describe the long-term impact of traumatic prisoner of war (POW) experiences within the context of posttraumatic psychopathology. Specifically, the authors attempted to investigate the relative degree of normative response represented by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in comparison to other DSM axis I disorders often found to be present, either alone or concomitant with other disorders, in survivors of trauma. METHOD: A community group of 262 U.S. World War II and Korean War former POWs was recruited. These men had been exposed to the multiple traumas of combat, capture, and imprisonment, yet few had ever sought mental health treatment. They were assessed for psychopathology with diagnostic interviews and psychodiagnostic testing. Regression analyses were used to assess the contributions of age at capture, war trauma, and postwar social support to PTSD and the other diagnosed disorders. RESULTS: More than half of the men (53%) met criteria for lifetime PTSD, and 29% met criteria for current PTSD. The most severely traumatized group (POWs held by the Japanese) had PTSD lifetime rates of 84% and current rates of 59%. Fifty-five percent of those with current PTSD were free from the other current axis I disorders (uncomplicated PTSD). In addition, 34% of those with lifetime PTSD had PTSD as their only lifetime axis I diagnosis. Regression analyses indicated that age at capture, severity of exposure to trauma, and postmilitary social support were moderately predictive of PTSD and only weakly predictive of other disorders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that PTSD is a persistent, normative, and primary consequence of exposure to severe trauma. (Am J Psychiatry 1997; 154:1576-1581)

N2  - Suicide rates in prisons are high. Our aim was to investigate the contribution of imitative suicide to the prison suicide rate. We used Knox tests for space‐time clustering in a case register of natural and self‐inflicted deaths in prisons in England and Wales and model simulations to estimate the effect size. We found significant space‐time clustering among 657 self‐inflicted deaths in 90 prisons over 10 years but no space‐time clustering among 430 deaths from natural causes in 87 prisons over this period. Model simulations with an imitation rate of 5.8% (CI 1%‐11%) reproduced the observed space‐time clustering.

N2  - In this work I illustrate the ways in which power structures function in operationalizing geographies of resistance in two particular carceral spaces. Specifically I examine the social organization and internal power relations present within hunger striking prison populations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. I show that the Guantanamo hunger strikes are minimally organized with non-binding power structures, while the Pelican Bay hunger strikes have had greater levels of commitment, and have been more sophisticated in organization. I consider the relationships that exist between power, identity and violence within these hunger strike resistance movements. I contextualize these phenomena within a biopolitical framework that transgresses more traditional definitions of biopolitics; as opposed to conceptualizing biopolitics as a technology of power manifested by the state, I argue that oppressed populations, such as prisoners, construct their own power by regulating their own ‘vital biological processes’.

N2  - Objective: Determine the incidence of hepatitis C virus antibodies among a cohort of prisoners. Design: Follow-up study of a random sample of prisoners who participated in a cross-sectional survey in 1996. Setting: 29 correctional centres in New South Wales (Australia). Participants: 181 adult prisoners (163 men and 18 women). Results: The incidence of hepatitis C virus antibody among the 90 inmates who were seronegative at the first test in 1996 was 7.1 per 100 person-years (16 seroconverters). Among the 90 inmates, 37 had re-entered the prison system following release into the community and 53 had been continuously detained. The seroconversion rate was higher among the re-entrants compared with those who had been continuously incarcerated (10.8 vs. 4.5 per 100 person-years, p=0.07). However, when the data was stratified by injecting status, the seroconversion rate in the two groups was similar. Most of the seroconverters had histories of injecting drug users (14/16). The overall incidence among injectors was 19.3 per 100 person years (95% CI: 9.1-29.2). Conclusions: Hepatitis C transmission occurs inside the prison with injecting drug use the likely cause. Among non-injectors, tattooing was the most likely mode of transmission. Harm minimisation measures with proven effectiveness need to be considered for this environment.

N2  - Objectives. We examined the sexual and injection drug use HIV and AIDS risk behaviors of female jail detainees.
Methods. The sample (n = 948) was stratified by charge type (felony vs misdemeanor) and race/ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, other).
Results. Non-Hispanic White women, women arrested for less serious charges, women who had prior arrests, women arrested on drug charges, and women with severe mental disorders were at especially high risk for sexual and injection drug transmission of HIV and AIDS.
Conclusions. Many women at risk for HIV and AIDS—women who use drugs, women who trade sex for money or drugs, homeless women, and women with mental disorders—eventually will cycle through jail. Because most jail detainees return to their communities within days, providing HIV and AIDS education in jail must become a public health priority.

N2  - This chapter presents three domains for digital psychiatry: research, its clinical manifestations, and a cultural response to it. It explains large-scale trends and initiatives in federally sponsored research. The chapter explains consumer-facing apps. It investigates a short film that thematizes some of these developments by illustrating them through a Black woman's experience of mental health care via digital technologies. The chapter connects these three areas to illuminate how digital psychiatry changes psychiatric power by joining it to technological power, and what this means for those made most vulnerable by social inequalities. A short film, Blaxites, produced by Surveillance Studies Centre at Queen's University, uses narrative to bring into high relief the issues around racialization and the digitalization of psychiatry, introducing questions about hidden audiences, coerced consent, and racialized power differentials.

N2  - Objectives. I sought to determine correlates of daily smoking among recently arrested women involved in the Drug Use Forecasting Program (DUF), many of whom are illicit drug users. Also, I compared smoking rates among DUF women, who were illicit drug users, with rates among women taking part in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, who do not have high levels of drug use, to determine if drug use accounts for heavy smoking.
Methods. I compared daily smoking, illicit drug use, and selected demographic characteristics in 2 DUF cities: New York, with the highest rate of smoking among DUF cities in 1997, and Los Angeles, with the lowest. I also compared DUF and BRFSS daily smoking rates.
Results: Although rates of illicit drug use were similar in New York and Los Angeles (69.7% and 61.8%, respectively), the daily smoking rate was higher in New York (90.9% vs 41.7%). DUF smoking rates were higher than BRFSS rates; both rates were higher than the general population (23%).
Conclusions. Illicit drug use does not, in all cases, explain high rates of daily smoking. Future efforts to shape tobacco-related public health policies in New York and elsewhere should involve collaboration with criminal justice transitional health programs.

N2  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of Criterion A traumatic events and current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in prisoners in Kocaeli Closed Prison. Method: The study was conducted in Kocaeli Closed Prison in Turkey. The sample consisted of 30 female and 30 male prisoners who had been in prison for at least 1 month. The PTSD and MDD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Traumatic Events Screening Instrument for Adults were used by experienced clinicians. Results: Most (n = 52, 86.7%) participants reported lifetime exposure to at least 1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) PTSD Criterion A event. Although the August 17, 1999, earthquake was the most prevalent traumatic event (n = 31, 51.7%), it was not related to the risk of current PTSD in prisoners. Current PTSD was rare among men (n = 2, 6.7%) and women (n = 3, 10%) but more prevalent than in community surveys of adults. Traumatic events that were relatively unique to the incarcerated population (e.g., committing murder) were identified. Moreover, 17% of women (n = 5) and men (n = 5) were diagnosed with MDD. Traumatic events that had the strongest conditional probabilities of association with a diagnosis of PTSD and MDD were identified. Conclusion: Exposure to traumatic stressors was highly prevalent among prisoners. Ongoing interpersonal traumatic events were particularly likely to be experienced as traumatic and related to PTSD and MDD, and violent criminal acts may be highly traumatic for the perpetrator.

N2  - An outbreak of tonsillopharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes occurred among inmates of a rural correctional center in New South Wales, Australia. A total of 72 (28%) of 256 inmates became ill in December 1999. S. pyogenes type M-75, T-25, which was opacity factor positive, was isolated from throat swab specimens obtained from 5 of 57 inmates with primary cases and from 4 of 15 inmates with secondary cases, as well as from specimens obtained from the hand wounds and throat of one of the food handlers. The consumption of curried egg rolls (i.e., curried egg salad sandwiches) was the most likely association with this outbreak. The presumed source of the food contamination was the food handler who had infected hand wounds. There has been only one other outbreak of streptococcal pharyngitis reported from a prison. Other outbreaks have been reported from military bases, nursing homes, and community picnics.

N2  - We performed this study to determine whether brief intermittent periods of low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest would improve cortical metabolic status and prolong the “safe” time of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
After a 2-hour baseline, newborn piglets were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and cooled to 18°C. The animals were then subjected to 80 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest interrupted by 5-minute periods of low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass at either 20 mL · kg
−1 · min
−1 (LF-20) or 80 mL · kg
−1 · min
−1 (LF-80) during 20, 40, 60, and 80 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. All animals were rewarmed, separated from cardiopulmonary bypass, and maintained for 2 hours (recovery). The oxygen pressure in the cerebral cortex was measured by the quenching of phosphorescence. The extracellular dopamine level in the striatum was determined by microdialysis. Results are means ± SD.
Prebypass oxygen pressure in the cerebral cortex was 65 ± 7 mm Hg. During the first 20 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, cortical oxygen pressure decreased to 1.3 ± 0.4 mm Hg. Four successive intermittent periods of LF-20 increased cortical oxygen pressure to 6.9 ± 1.2 mm Hg, 6.6 ± 1.9 mm Hg, 5.3 ± 1.6 mm Hg, and 3.1 ± 1.2 mm Hg. During the intermittent periods of LF-80, cortical oxygen pressure increased to 21.1 ± 5.3 mm Hg, 20.6 ± 3.7 mm Hg, 19.5 ± 3.95 mm Hg, and 20.8 ± 5.5 mm Hg. A significant increase in extracellular dopamine occurred after 45 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest alone, whereas in the groups of LF-20 and LF-80, the increase in dopamine did not occur until 52.5 and 60 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, respectively.
The protective effect of intermittent periods of low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest is dependent on the flow rate. We observed that a flow rate of 80 mL · kg
−1 · min
−1 improved brain oxygenation and prevented an increase in extracellular dopamine release.

N2  - Abstract Quercetin is involved in several biological activities including inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. However, it is unclear and unknown whether quercetin influences cell maturation. We examined the effect of quercetin on the growth and differentiation of human preadipocyte cells AML-I. Induced growth arrest of AML-I by quercetin was accompanied by the appearance of characteristics of apoptosis under the adipogenic stimulation by annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate staining method. A decrease of nuclear factor– κ B and the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and an increase of the proapoptotic protein Bad were observed in time-dependent fashion in the quercetin-treated cells compared with the vehicle-treated cells by Western blot analysis. Structure-related flavonoids, including rutin (quercetin-3- O -rutinoside) and quercitrin (quercetin-3- O -rhamnoside), did not have any cytotoxic effect on AML-I. Interestingly, exposure of AML-I to quercetin for 6 days increased the amount of cytoplasmic lipid droplets as well as the expression of fatty acid synthase and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ proteins. These results suggested that apoptosis induced by quercetin was not linked to adipogenic conversion of preadipocytes.

N2  - This study investigated the prevalence of psychotic symptoms among incarcerated boys as well as the relationship between these symptoms and violent offending and criminal recidivism. The presence of psychotic symptoms was assessed in a representative sample of 204 incarcerated boys aged 12-18 using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-2.3).
Seventy-two percent of the study participants had committed a violent index offense and 30 percent were criminal recidivists. Thirty-four percent (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27-41%) were DISC-2.3 psychosis screen positive: 25% (95% CI: 19-31%) reported at least one pathognomonic of schizophrenia symptom and 9% (95% CI: 6-14%) reported at least three non-pathognomonic psychotic symptoms. In addition, 33 percent (95% CI: 26-40%) reported one or two isolated, atypical psychotic symptoms. The presence of psychotic symptoms was not associated with violent offending or criminal recidivism.
The high prevalence rate of psychotic symptoms among incarcerated boys calls for increased attention to diagnosis and treatment of psychosis. To obtain conclusive answers regarding the relationship between psychosis and violent offending, additional studies are needed in general population samples.

N2  - We assessed a programme of tuberculosis control in a prison setting in Baku, Azerbaijan. The programme used first-line therapy and DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course).
467 patients had sputum-positive tuberculosis. Their treatment regimens followed WHO guidelines, and they had regular clinical examinations and dietary supplements. Isolates were tested by standard methods for resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin in three laboratories. Treatment success was defined as three consecutive negative sputum smears at end of treatment. Factors independently associated with treatment failure were estimated by logistic regression.
Drug-resistance data on admission were available for 131 patients. 55% of patients had strains of
Mycobacterium tuberculosisresistant to two or more antibiotics. Mortality during treatment was 11%, and 13% of patients defaulted. Overall, treatment was successful in 54% of patients, and in 71% of those completing treatment. 104 patients completed a full treatment regimen and remained sputum-positive. Resistance to two or more antibiotics, a positive sputum result at the end of initial treatment, cavitary disease, and poor compliance were independently associated with treatment failure.
The effectiveness of a DOTS programme with first-line therapy fell short of the 85% target set by WHO. First-line therapy may not be sufficient in settings with a high degree of resistance to antibiotics.

N2  - This dissertation is a multi-methodological and interdisciplinary project that examines how those who have been designated as "sex offenders" and are homeless in the Maryland/DC area are managed and regulated by various technologies of governance such as social policies, sex offender registries, and civil commitment statutes. By looking at the cultural, social, and political geography of shelters, the suburbs, and the city, I challenge scholars to reconsider how we understand stigma, belonging, and home. More broadly, I consider how the very construction of home is bound up in processes of sexual regulation and management that produce certain people as homeless by virtue of their proximity to sexual impropriety, deviance, and blackness. Put otherwise, some people are made to be or kept homeless as a result of their sexual practices or non-normative gender presentations, particularly when they are in direct conflict with dominant discourses about and legal definitions of acceptable sexual and gendered behavior. Access to home is equally mitigated by race. There has been, and continues to be, a long history of racial minorities searching for, being denied, and yet building home in geopolitical spaces that often articulate them as outside of home—as, in fact, homeless. I examine how those processes happen in tandem with and in contradistinction to modes of regulation organized around sexual deviance and difference. Drawing on scholarship in African American studies, carceral studies, and gender and sexuality studies, this project makes three critical interventions: 1) it frames sexuality as a central category of analysis necessary for understanding homelessness; 2) it offers new perspectives on the ways homeless sex offenders navigate and resist modes of racialized hypersurveillance; and 3) it argues that the structure of homeless shelters and housing policies are inherently designed to manage deviance. I draw on interviews of homeless service providers and homeless sex offenders, placing them in conversation with sex offender laws, public media, and popular film to map out the multiple contexts that structure the lives of homeless sex offenders. In doing so, I offer an alternative framework for policy interventions that attempt to address homelessness without centering the issue of race and sexuality.

N2  - Technology-facilitated crime control solutions have been largely informed by classical criminological perspectives, organized around technological solutions (e.g., credit-monitoring, anti-virus, and firewall), moderation of content by online platforms and services, and specialized law enforcement units or task forces. This approach often results in the growth and centralization of state and corporate power while ignoring the conditions that draw people to crime in the first place. In response to these trends in online crime control, this chapter provides a realist criminological perspective on internet-facilitated crimes. Realist criminology is a victimological perspective that emphasizes the creation of direct and achievable solutions that address the socio-structural roots of crime and victimization. A realist criminology of the internet works toward solutions to internet-facilitated crime and victimization that avoid unnecessary expansions of state and corporate surveillance systems and related harms. This chapter details the theoretical challenges confronting a realist criminology of the internet and provides potential ways forward for this perspective.

N2  - Adolescents who have been incarcerated are at extreme risk for poor adult outcomes. However, some former youth offenders become successful, happy adults, presenting a profile of strength and coping known as resilience. This article describes the results of a 5-year qualitative examination of resilience among a group of adolescents transitioning from youth correctional facilities back into their communities. Topics discussed include predelinquent histories, experiences in the correctional system, and postcorrections transition. Currently about half of the respondents are successful—employed, going to school, or raising children. Others are less stable and may be at risk of being rearrested. Internal and situational factors accounting for these differences are discussed. Implications for practice include restructuring post-corrections transition services and improving school-based supports to at-risk youth.

N2  - There is a high prevalence of tobacco consumption among prisoners. This study aimed to establish tobacco use, to explore and assess oral cancer awareness and to identify associations between oral cancer awareness and tobacco use in a sample of male prisoners in a local Indian prison. Methodology: A systematically selected random sample of male prisoners participated and a structured interview schedule was used, generated from two different sets of validated standardised questionnaires: the WHO STEPS instrument for NCD (Non Communicable Diseases) Risk Factors to assess tobacco consumption and the modified Humphris Oral Cancer Knowledge Scale to assess oral cancer knowledge. Results: Participation rate was 100%. Prevalence of tobacco consumption, mainly smoked, amongst prisoners was 68.5 % (95% CI 63, 73%) The mean oral cancer knowledge score amongst prisoners was 13.28 (95% CI 12.9, 13.6). Statistically significant associations (P<0.05) were found between oral cancer knowledge and age of participants, years of education and starting age of tobacco use. No association was found between oral cancer knowledge and tobacco consumption. Conclusions: Tobacco use was high. Knowledge did not appear to impact on this behaviour, indicating the need for effective smoking interventions in this sample.

N2  - Background
Engagement in drug trafficking may place a child or youth at risk for exposure to severe violence, drug abuse, and death. However, little is know about the nature of youth involvement in drug trafficking. The purpose of this study is to describe drug trafficking behaviour of delinquent youth and identify adverse experiences as potential predictors of trafficking.
Methods
Cross-sectional sample of youth (12–17 years of age) incarcerated in detention facilities for delinquent or criminal acts in São Paulo City, Brazil. Structured face-to-face interviews completed with 325 youth (289 boys, 36 girls).
Results
Approximately half of the boys and girls in this sample have had at least some role in drug trafficking prior to incarceration. Though youth who had engaged in drug trafficking activities did not differ on basic socio-demographic variables, they were more likely to have been exposed to a number of adverse experiences. Beyond heavy substance use, no longer attending school, gang involvement, witnessing violence, and easier access to guns, drugs and alcohol remained significantly related to trafficking involvement in the final regression model. Girls experienced a very similar pattern of adverse exposures as boys.
Conclusion
Special efforts may be required for rehabilitation of youth who engage in drug trafficking. Potential targets may include keeping or re-engaging delinquent youth in school for longer periods of time and reducing youth exposure to violence in poor urban communities.

N2  - The main objective of this study is to assess current hepatitis C services for female prisoners. The study design includes a retrospective audit of inmates’ contact with blood-borne virus (BBV) services and outcomes of service use. The study was carried out at a prison for women in the north of England with 179 prisoners and 69 service users. The outcome measures were proportions in contact with services and outcomes of service use (time to testing/treatment; proportion positive for hepatitis C; HIV status). Almost a quarter of those arriving at the prison have contact with BBV services; most of them report a history of intravenous drug use (75.4%), although one-fifth of such individuals decline testing. The average number of days from imprisonment to testing was 86-half this time if arriving since October 2006. Fifty percent were positive for the hepatitis C antibody, the majority of whom (83.3%) had an active virus and were suitable for treatment. The average number of days from testing to referral was 38. All tested for HIV were negative. Therefore, efficiency is necessary if prisoners are to access BBV services while incarcerated. This is being achieved, although some delays still occur.

N2  - Background. Injecting drug users (IDU) are at risk of parenterally transmitted diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We investigated whether a history of syringe sharing in prison is a risk factor for these infections. In the longitudinal part of the study, HBV, HCV, and HIV seroincidence rates were determined.
Methods. The participants were recruited by multisite-sampling at different agencies for IDU. Data on risk behaviour were obtained by a standardized questionnaire. Serological markers for HBV, HCV, and HIV were determined. Logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for confounding effects.
Results. A history of syringe sharing in prison was significantly associated with HBV (adjusted prevalence odds ratio [POR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] : 2-10), HCV (POR = 9.7, 95% CI : 3-33), and HIV infection (POR = 10.4, 95% CI :4-29). The HIV seroincidence rate was 5.9 per 100 person-years. None of the IDU receiving methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) seroconverted whereas the HIV incidence was 8.5 among IDU not in MMT (P = 0.01).
Conclusions. The increased risk of HBV, HCV, and HIV infection among IDU who had shared syringes in prison warrants specific preventive action. The longitudinal data suggest that IDU in MMT have a lower risk of HIV infection.

N2  - Background: Italian law allows female prisoners in specific "nest areas" to keep their babies with them until the child reache the age of 3 years. We describe health care of children living in the nest areas and we compare this condition with the general population. Methods: Our study was conducted in the female detention centre of Rome Rebibbia, Italy. Clinical diaries of all babies have been screened. The pediatrics ambulatory of A. Gemelli Hospital of Rome provided all data for comparison. Results: We describe 391 children (150 in the prison group, G1; 150 children with Italian parents, G2, and 91 children with foreign parents, G3) with similar characteristics. There were statistical differences between-groups in respect of the auxological data, gestational age (lower in G1 vs G2, p < 0.0004, and lower in G1 vs G3, p < 0.03), time of weaning age earlier in G1 vs G2, (p < 0.035), number of respiratory infective disease (G1 > G2, p < 0.0001, and G1 > G3, p < 0.003). We also found inadequate immunisation status in children at their admission to prison. According to our observations children received good sanitary assistance inside the prison and the adjustment of their immunisation status when they stayed in prison for a long enough period. Conclusions: The significant information shown by our data suggest that children living in prison with their mothers represent a vulnerable group with particular healthcare needs.

N2  - Six male prisoners who misused xylometazoline nasal drops by inhalation were interviewed by a prison physician in 2006. The prisoners received xylometazoline drops during regular visits in the prison ambulatory service. In order to get the medication, the subjects reported false symptoms of rhinosinusitis and allergic reactions. Psychoactive effects of inhaled xylometazoline were described as "stimulation," "excitation," and "feeling of strength." Although preliminary, our findings suggest that topical adrenergic decongestants can produce rewarding effects when administered by inhalation.

N2  - Inmate populations include a large number of individuals at risk of HIV infection. However, there is insufficient data about HIV/AIDS epidemiology in prisons. Our study, conducted in Zambia, a sub-Saharan African nation with an estimated HIV prevalence of 19% in adults, was designed to address this shortfall.

N2  - This study investigates whether insecure attachment distinguishes sexual from nonsexual offenders and whether insecure attachment is reflected in the choices of victims, modus operandi, and nature of the sexual acts. Incarcerated male sexual and nonsexual offenders were surveyed. Insecure attachment distinguished sexual offenders from nonsexual offenders but was not related to the characteristics of the sexual offenses, with the exception of victim age. The methodological, theoretical, and clinical implications of the findings are discussed, and an alternative line of inquiry is proposed.

N2  - Objective Although deep hypothermic circulatory arrest has been known to induce neuronal injury, the molecular mechanism of this damage has not been identified. We studied the key molecular mediators through cellular energy failure, excitotoxicity, and overactivation of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 in brain tissues of a rabbit model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest similar to clinical settings. Methods We established 2 models of cardiopulmonary bypass (n = 15) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (n = 15) associated with cerebral microdialysis in rabbits. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest lasted for 60 minutes. The measurements of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, and glutamate collected by means of microdialysis were quantified by using a microdialysis analyzer and high-performance liquid chromatography. The overactivation of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 was assessed by detecting immunostaining of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose). Histologic studies were used to identify neuronal morphologic changes and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling staining and poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 Western blotting were used to identify apoptotic cells and early apoptotic signals. Results Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest significantly increased the lactate/pyruvate and lactate/glucose ratios and the glutamate value, whereas cardiopulmonary bypass did not ( P < .05). Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest significantly increased the numbers of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose)–positive and apoptotic neurons compared with cardiopulmonary bypass ( P < .05). The cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 was only found in the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group. More injured neurons were found in the deep hypothermic circulatory arrest group (histologic scores, P < .05). Conclusions This study demonstrated that deep hypothermic circulatory arrest results in an overactivation of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1, and that there were molecular events consisting of cellular energy failure, excitotoxicity, overactivation of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1, and necrosis and/or apoptosis in neuronal injury.

N2  - My dissertation explores the social experience and environmental politics of mass incarceration in five communities in New York's Adirondack Park, with a focus on the period 1975-1999. Historians, sociologists, and criminologists have enhanced our understanding of criminal law and its impacts on lawbreakers, their families, and communities. By the same token, environmental historians have expanded our knowledge of the dynamic forces that contributed to the making of parks and recreational spaces across the United States. With rare exceptions, scholars in these fields have left unexplored one of the consequences of postindustrial decline, namely, the mass incarceration of predominantly urban, non-white men in penal institutions situated in overwhelmingly white, rural communities far from their homes. This project, therefore, seeks to begin a conversation about the many people, environments, and economies that have been implicated in the United States' criminal justice system. I argue that city dwellers' desire for "law and order," and Park residents' clamor for economic development, outweighed the failures of mass incarceration, leading to construction of a crimescape in the Adirondacks in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Anti-prison rancor in affluent parts of New York pushed correctional planners to the North Country, where they encountered communities whose permanent residents, seasonal dwellers, history, and natural environment greatly complicated the state's carceral objectives. While many locals welcomed the prospect of increased economic activity, second homeowners and other outsiders bristled at the idea of their vacationland becoming a gulag. Environmental regulators found themselves in the crosshairs of locals suspicious of state power, elite vacationers demanding a halt to penal expansion in the Park, and prison officials eager to fill more cells. In the end, corrections leaders hashed out compromises with environmental bureaucrats that mollified supporters and opponents and paved the way for nearly a dozen new prisons. While escapes, violence, and unrest were ever-present in the area's prison towns, the free labor of inmate workers in communities across the region helped facilitate the slow naturalization of the Adirondacks' crimescape.

The Routledge History of the Twentieth-Century United States is a comprehensive introduction to the most important trends and developments in the study of modern United States history. Driven by interdisciplinary scholarship, the thirty-four original chapters underscore the vast range of identities, perspectives and tensions that contributed to the growth and contested meanings of the United States in the twentieth century. The chronological and topical breadth of the collection highlights critical political and economic developments of the century while also drawing attention to relatively recent areas of research, including borderlands, technology and disability studies. Dynamic and flexible in its possible applications, The Routledge History of the Twentieth-Century United States offers an exciting new resource for the study of modern American history.

N2  - Because inmates’ actions are restricted by incarceration,
Tarasoff
duties in prisons have certain unique aspects. There are two broad situations: (1) when the potential victim is located within the prison community; and (2) when the potential victim is located outside of prison. Although responsibilities vary widely from state to state, this paper discusses general principles of exercising
Tarasoff
duties in prison settings. In addition to duties to protect potential victims, correctional mental-health professionals have an ethical duty to protect patient confidentiality. Professionals should chose
Tarasoff
options that protect confidentiality to the fullest extent possible, and prisoners should be informed of situations where confidentiality does not exist. A caveat is that no
Tarasoff
statutes can be relied upon to offer tort protection to correctional clinicians until they have been tested in appellate courts.

N2  - Background Detainees have a substantial risk to develop tuberculosis (TB) due to a higher incidence of TB in remand prison compared to the civil community. They develop TB during incarceration not only due to poor living conditions in remand prison, but also due to some factors affecting their life before imprisonment. Prevention measures against TB spread from penitentiary institutions to society include study of factors, which contribute to TB development. Current study aims at identification of important risk factors of TB development in remand prison in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods A retrospective matched case-control study was performed from May 2002 to May 2003 in two remand prisons in St. Petersburg. One hundred and fourteen prisoners (57 cases, 57 controls) were interviewed by using standardised questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors. Results Six factors were significantly linked to the risk of developing TB: narcotic drug use (odds ratio (OR): 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-6.9), low income (OR: 3.2, CI: 1.2-8.6), high ratio of prisoners per available bed (OR: 4.0, CI: 1.1-15.0), not having own bed clothes (OR: 13.0, CI: 2.7-61.6), and little time outdoors (OR: 3.3, CI: 1.3-8.5). However, good housing before imprisonment (OR: 4.2, CI: 1.1-15.7) was a separate risk factor for TB. Conclusions Three of the risk factors (high number of prisoners per bed, not having own bed clothes, and little time outdoors) are certainly possible to approach by improvement of conditions in remand prisons. The remaining three factors (narcotic drug use, good housing before imprisonment, and low income) provide knowledge about study population, but cannot be intervened by prison's medical staff.

N2  - This chapter describes the key concerns of feminists and the goals they work to achieve. Feminists do have a variety of concerns that drive their organizing, many of which depend on their communities and experiences. However, the common feminist concerns outlined in this chapter are: wage gap, gender-based violence, healthcare inequalities, reproductive health care, prison industrial complex, climate change and environmental inequalities, childcare insecurity, inequality in technology and online harassment, media inequality, and political representation. Throughout the chapter there are examples of inequalities and the everyday ramifications of them, such as workplace sexual harassment, childcare insecurity, and the lack of diversity in news and entertainment. Readers will understand the importance of recognizing the wide variety of concerns that feminists have and how when we analyze feminism and look to identify it, it requires a broad lens and an understanding of how intersectional feminist concerns include considerations of gender, race, class, sexuality, immigration, and/or ability. As the previous chapters have attested, what feminists care about is deeply connected with the work of other movements, and feminists operate in tandem with many other movement activists, such as climate change and anti-carceral feminists. The chapter concludes with a mini toolkit about non-disclosure agreements.

N2  - Because prisoners with preincarceration heroin dependence typically relapse following release, a pilot study examined a novel opioid agonist maintenance program whereby consenting males initiated levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) treatment shortly before release from prison with opportunity to continue maintenance in the community. Treated prisoners (experimental group) were compared with controls who received community treatment referral information only and prisoners who withdrew from treatment prior to medication regarding treatment participation and community adjustment during nine months post-release. Nineteen of 20 (95%) prisoners who initiated maintenance in prison entered community treatment, compared with 3 of 31 (10%) controls, and 1 of 13 (8%) who withdrew. Moreover, 53% of experimental participants remained in community treatment at least six months, while no other participants did so. Differences in heroin use and criminal involvement between experimental participants and each of the other two groups, while not consistently statistically significant, uniformly favored the experimental group. Despite study limitations, robust findings regarding treatment attendance suggest that this intervention is highly promising.

N2  - Objective To investigate whether the empirical or DSM-oriented scales of the Youth Self-Report (YSR) can be used to screen for DSM psychiatric disorders among incarcerated boys. DSM-oriented scales have recently been developed by Achenbach to enhance comparability of YSR results with DSM diagnostic categories. Method A representative sample (N = 196) of incarcerated boys aged 12-18 was assessed with the child version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-C) to diagnose DSM psychiatric disorders, and with the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Results Only 22% had YSR total problem scores in the clinical range, whereas 90 % met criteria of at least one DSM/DISC-C psychiatric disorder. Weak associations between both empirical and DSM-oriented YSR scale scores and DSM/DISC-C diagnoses were found. Conclusions Neither the empirical nor the DSM-oriented YSR scales adequately screen for DSM/DISC-C psychiatric disorders among incarcerated boys. The use of the YSR and the DISC-C to assess DSM constructs results in, at least partially, different diagnostic information.

N2  - There is poor adherence with tuberculosis preventive therapy among patients released from short-term correctional facilities, leading to recommendations against screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in this setting.
To assess adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) following release from short-term correctional facilities, and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of this practice.
Records of individuals referred for IPT from the Connecticut Department of Corrections to the City of Hartford Chest Clinic between January 1993 and June 1997 were reviewed. The data abstracted included demographics, adherence to IPT, and the duration of IPT completed before release from prison. An analysis was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of this program.
A total of 168 records were reviewed. The mean duration of IPT completed before release from prison was 8 weeks. Eighty-six subjects (57%) never came to clinic after release. Of the 64 subjects (43%) who attended clinic at least once, 35 subjects (55%) completed IPT and 29 subjects (45%) were unavailable for follow-up before completing therapy. Thirty-three of the 64 subjects (52%) who attended the clinic had to be restarted on IPT due to a prolonged lapse in therapy prior to the first visit. We estimate that $32,866 was spent on this program, but $42,093 in future costs associated with reactivation tuberculosis was prevented.
Adherence with IPT is poor in patients released from short-term correctional facilities. Nonetheless, this program was cost-effective. An alternative strategy may be to screen for LTBI among inmates of short-term correctional facilities but withhold IPT in inmates expected to be released before therapy would be completed. Instead, these inmates could be referred to an appropriate clinic after release. Prophylaxis may be started in subjects who keep an initial clinic appointment after release.

N2  - The “Viennese Instrument for Suicidality in Correctional Institutions” (VISCI) presented here is based on the results of a large case‐control study and on research on literature examining suicide prevention in general and in the prison population in particular. The aim of this study was to validate the properties of the VISCI to differentiate between suicides and nonsuicides. The sensitivity and specificity of the VISCI was tested in the files of 55 correctional suicides, and 110 controls. VISCI differentiated well between suicides and nonsuicides. The routine administration of the VISCI may help to direct the existing professional attention to inmates with the highest need.

N2  - Aims. To ascertain the prevalence of recent drug use among police detainees.
 Data. Data were gathered over a 1‐year period in 1999 from detainees in four Australian police stations. Measures analysed include: (a) urinalysis results for cannabis, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine and opiates; (b) socio‐economic and demographic backgrounds of detainees; and (c) arrest history and imprisonment.
 Setting. Bankstown and Parramatta police stations, Sydney, East Perth Lockup, Perth and Southport Watchhouse, Southport, Australia.
 Participants. 1408 adult males detained by police were approached. Eighty‐four per cent agreed to complete an interview and 70% provided a urine specimen.
 Findings. Cannabis was most likely to be detected, followed by opiates, benzodiazepines, and then amphetamines. Very little cocaine was detected. Around three‐quarters tested positive to at least one drug and around one‐third tested positive to multiple drug use. Significant predictors for recent drug use were age, reported involvement in illegal activities and prior arrest and imprisonment. Those who tested positive to opiates were more likely to be charged with property offences while those who tested positive to cannabis were more likely to be charged with a drug offence.
 Conclusions. To monitor effectively patterns of drug use among at‐risk populations such as detainees data collections grounded at the local level are necessary.

N2  - In an era characterised by impacts of cuts and austerity in the UK, this study is positioned at the interface between two socio-cultural institutions against which societies are judged: the arts and criminal justice. Within this field, the thesis investigates the ways women in prison are positioned in a carceral performance that is cyclical and inevitably ‘tragic’. The argument considers the tactics women use in order to firstly, survive their incarceration, and sometimes, resist, the institution. The theoretical frame is drawn from feminist criminology and Bourdieu’s ‘habitus’ to examine everyday performances as well as theatrical works by and about incarcerated women. This project adds to the field by locating performance practices in and of prison within wider social contexts of the politics of carceral spaces. The main questions posed by this project were ‘what does theatre/ performance offer to challenge stereotypes of ‘the cage’?; and to what extent and in what ways does performance in (and of) prison challenge/ subvert/ augment/ transform the site itself’? The research sought to understand to what extent women’s articulations of subjectivity could be a radical alternative to the logocentric and discursive prisons of sentences and prison records. The study was developed as an ethnographic examination of performance in and of prison, alongside exploring how contemporary performance modes are implicated in defining, containing, and correcting (criminal) women’s everyday performances. The thesis is primarily concerned with a critical reflection on theatre practices in prison, with particular emphasis on the political implications of the effects of prison as/and performance. The study makes claims for a radical practice in and about prisons that is distanced from current applied theatre practices, and as such points towards a more troubled rehearsal of how punishment is performed.

N2  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyse the prevalence of HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations among HIV-1-infected prison inmates in Spain. Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with an HIV RNA viral load of >= 2,000 copies/ml were included. To ensure that the study population was representative of the entire HIV-infected Spanish inmate population, a two-stage conglomerate for selection of the sample was used. In the first stage, 15 prisons were randomly selected, and in the second stage, 38 patients (30 treatment-experienced and 8 treatment-naive) per centre were randomly selected. Genotyping was performed by automatic sequencing. Resistance testing was performed on viral strains from 184 inmates from 12 prisons. Valid sequences were obtained from 133 inmates (90 treatment-experienced and 43 treatment-naive inmates). Most (92.5%) were men and had acquired HIV infection by intravenous drug use (91%); their mean age was 35 years. One or more key resistance mutations were detected in 5 (11.6%) treatment-naive and in 35 (38.6%) treatment-experienced patients. Among treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was found in 3 (6.9%) and in 20 (22.2%) patients, respectively, resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in 3 (6.9%) and in 21 (23.3%) patients, and resistance to protease inhibitors in 3 (6.9%) and in 14 (15.5%) patients. Multidrug resistance was detected in 1 of the 43 (2.3%) treatment-naive patients. These findings support the use of resistance testing in HIV-infected inmates who must begin antiretroviral therapy, given the high rate of primary resistance to drugs frequently included in the initial treatment regimens.

N2  - Objective:The authors assessed DSM-III-R disorders among American former prisoners of war. Comorbidity, time of onset, and the relationship of trauma severity to complicated versus uncomplicated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were examined. Method:A community sample (N=262) of men exposed to combat and imprisonment was assessed by clinicians using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R.Results:The rates of comorbidity among the men with PTSD were lower than rates from community samples assessed by lay interviewers. Over one-third of the cases of lifetime PTSD were uncomplicated by another axis I disorder; over one-half of the cases of current PTSD were uncomplicated. PTSD almost always emerged soon after exposure to trauma. Lifetime PTSD was associated with increased risk of lifetime panic disorder, major depression, alcohol abuse dependence, and social phobia. Current PTSD was associated with increased risk of current panic disorder, dysthymia, social phobia, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. Relative to PTSD, the onset of the comorbid disorders was as follows: major depression, predominantly secondary; alcohol abuse dependence and agoraphobia, predominantly concurrent (same year); social phobia, equal proportions primary and concurrent; and panic disorder, equal proportions concurrent and secondary. Trauma exposure was comparable in the subjects with complicated and uncomplicated PTSD.Conclusions:The types of comorbid diagnoses and their patterns of onset were comparable to the diagnoses and patterns observed in other community samples. The findings support the validity of the PTSD construct; PTSD can be distinguished from comorbid disorders. Uncomplicated PTSD may be more common than previous studies suggest, particularly in clinician-assessed subjects exposed to severe trauma. Am J Psychiatry 1998; 155: 1740-1745

N2  - Objective: To describe the self-reported history of health service utilization and helpseeking to those who are drug-dependent in the period of time prior to imprisonment.
Method: A cross-section survey of 3142 sentenced or remand prisoners in English prisons completed private, face-to-face interviews with trained Office for National Statistics staff covering a full structured psychiatric assessment interview. Specific questions about service utilization prior to imprisonment were included, as were questions on patterns of drug use and dependence prior to imprisonment.
Results: Receipt of any form of help was demographically most strongly associated with being older, white and female. Women were about twice as likely as men to report having received help for mental or emotional problems. Older age was also consistently associated with greater levels of reporting having received help, for both genders but only for use of general practitioners. Being black was strongly associated with reduced likelihood of receiving help and this was maintained after adjusting for other sociodemographic variables. Opioid dependence alone or opioid dependence with stimulant dependence, psychiatric disorder alone and probable psychosis were all most predictive of service use in the 12 months prior to imprisonment.
Conclusions: In the year prior to imprisonment, the majority of mental health needs of these individual prisoners were not able to access help prior to imprisonment. Future strategies should aim for better health access beofre, during and after imprisonment.

N2  - Background The capacity of heat stress induction to improve myocardial tolerance against ischemia is well known. We investigated cardiac energy metabolism after hsp 72+ /73+ induction in isolated perfused neonatal rabbit hearts subjected to prolonged cold cardioplegic ischemia. Methods Hearts from neonatal rabbits were excised, isolated perfused and arrested by 2-h cold cardioplegic ischemia. Rectal temperature of eight neonatal rabbits was raised to 42.0 to 42.5°C for heat shock protein expression in a whole body water bath for 15 min before the onset of arrest. Another set of eight rabbits without hyperthermia pretreatment served as control. Recovery of left ventricle function was assessed by aortic flow, cardiac output, and max dP/dt. Status of high-energy phosphates was measured by31 phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy. Results Immunoblot analysis revealed clear hsp 72+/73+ induction after a brief period of systemic hyperthermia. Heat stress pretreatment resulted in a better recovery of left ventricular function (aortic flow and cardiac output improvement P < 0.05, max dP/dt P < 0.01) than in controls at 60 min after reperfusion. During ischemia and reperfusion, myocardial energy metabolism was better preserved in hearts after hsp induction as a consequence of increased γ-, α-, and β-ATP as well as phosphocreatine-values over controls. The ischemia-induced pH-decrease was attenuated. Conclusion These data contribute to the evidence of heat stress mediated beneficial effects on functional myocardial recovery and improved cardiac energy metabolism after prolonged cold cardioplegic ischemia. More importantly, the attenuation of ischemic pH reduction and better restoration suggest an involvement of mitochondrial membrane potential alterations.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence incidence, and risk factors for occupational infection with tuberculosis among healthcare workers employed in correctional facilities. Methods: The authors conducted a self-administered survey, clinical interview, and tuberculin skin testing. Results: The overall tuberculin skin test point prevalence rate was 17.7%, the reactivity rate was 2.2%, and the annual incidence was 1.3%. At the multivariate level, after controlling for bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination, only origin of birth remained significantly associated with prevalence of tuberculosis infection. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of tuberculin reactivity was high in this population, the risk factors were predominantly demographic rather than occupational. Nevertheless, continued vigilance to control occupational exposure to this and other respiratory pathogens is warranted, given the potential for future outbreaks of tuberculosis, as well as other known and emerging airborne pathogens.

N2  - The aim of this study was to contribute to clarification of the relations between antisocial personality disorder (APD) and its potential risk factors in a population of 560 French male prisoners.
Adverse childhood was assessed as a latent variable determined by several traumatic events. APD (MINI), character and temperament (Cloninger's model), WAIS
®-III similarities subtest and psychosocial characteristics were assessed by two clinicians. The WAIS
®-III subtest accounts for verbal and cognitive performance. We used a structural model to determine the weight of the different pathways between adverse childhood and APD.
Study confirmed the major and direct role of adverse childhood (standardized coefficient
=
0.48). An intermediate effect mediated by character (considered as a global variable) and novelty-seeking was also shown, confirming previous results from the literature.
This study emphasizes the role of adverse childhood in APD, suggesting the potential benefit of early intervention in the prevention of antisocial behaviours.
Le but de cette étude portant sur 560 hommes détenus dans des prisons françaises est de clarifier les relations entre la personnalité antisociale (PAS) et ses potentiels facteurs de risques.
L’« enfance difficile » a été définie comme une variable latente, déterminée par plusieurs événements traumatiques survenus dans l’enfance. La personnalité antisociale (MINI), le caractère et le tempérament (Cloninger), le test des similitudes de la WAIS
®-III et les caractéristiques psychosociales ont été évaluées par un binôme de cliniciens. Nous avons utilisé un model structural pour déterminer le poids des différents chemins reliant l’« enfance difficile » et la PAS.
Cette étude confirme le rôle majeur de l’« enfance difficile » et son caractère direct (coefficient standardisé
=
0,48). Un effet indirect médié par le caractère (considéré comme une variable globale) et la « recherche de nouveauté » est également retrouvé, confirmant les résultats de la littérature.
Cette étude met en évidence le rôle de l’enfance difficile dans la PAS, suggérant le bénéfice potentiel d’une intervention précoce dans la prévention des comportements antisociaux.

N2  - Background: Despite France being regarded as a model of efficient harm reduction policy and equity of access to care in the general community, the health of French inmates is a critical issue, as harm reduction measures are either inaccessible or only partially implemented in French prisons.
Method: Using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, information was collected and analyzed about HIV, HBV and HCV prevalence, risk practices, mortality, access to harm reduction measures and care for French prison inmates.
Results: Data about the occurrence of bloodborne diseases, drug use and access to care in prisons remain limited and need urgent updating. Needle exchange programs are not yet available in French prisons and harm reduction interventions and access to OST remain limited or are heterogeneous across prisons. The continuity of care at prison entry and after release remains problematic and should be among the primary public health priorities for French prisoners.
Conclusion: Preventive and harm reduction measures should be urgently introduced at least as pilot programs. The implementation of such measures, not yet available in French prisons, is not only a human right for prison inmates but can also provide important public health benefits for the general population.

N2  - In this paper we describe a decision support system developed to help in assessing the need for various types of prison cells. In particular we predict the probability that a criminal has to be sent home because of a shortage of cells. The problem is modelled through a queuing network with blocking after service. The main objective of our study is to describe our analytical method and an approximate algorithm to solve this network. Through simulation studies we evaluate our method. Both the analytic and the simulation tool are elements of the decision support system.

N2  - This article is a case study of a child killer called Harold Jones. It uses previously unseen documents to consider how the inter-war penal system of England and Wales responded to Jones's sexual sadism at the time of his murders. The article examines the contribution of two significant Prison Commissioners of that time - Alexander Paterson and Dr. W. Norwood East - who were responsible, in different ways, for many of the penal reforms that occurred during 1920s and 1930s. The article is specifically focussed on the decision to release Jones from prison in 1941 and on the different approaches of Paterson and Norwood East to understanding Jones's sexual sadism. From this analysis, we suggest lessons that can be learned when considering the release of those who have been convicted of murder. Finally, we consider whether Jones would have been released today if his case was presented to and considered by the Parole Board.

N2  - Background: The correction-based therapeutic community (TC) is one of the most described treatment modalities for (substance abusing) incarcerated offenders. The origins and development of the therapeutic community have been traced back to two independent traditions: the American hierarchical conceptbased TC and the British democratic Maxwell Jones-type TC. Both branches have developed independently, targeting different people and tackling diverse problems.
Aims: To demonstrate that there are clear and undeniable similarities between the ‘two’ prison-based therapeutic communities.
Method: A comparative historical review of the literature and a critical discussion and comparison.
Results: The links between the democratic and hierarchical therapeutic communities are summarised under five headings: social learning and behavioural modification; permissiveness and modelling; democracy and hierarchy; communalism and community as method; reality testing and ‘acting as if ’.
Conclusions: The ‘two’ correction-based therapeutic communities are on converging pathways. Far from being oppositional models, they can be regarded as being complementary.

N2  - My project examines the legal, political-economic, and ideological manifestations of the U.S. neoliberal racial state through the lens of parapublic carcerality. I introduce and elaborate the term parapublic carcerality throughout this exploration to describe more accurately the incursionary, politico-regulatory technology of what has heretofore been indexed by the lingua franca of “private prison” and/or “for-profit prison.” Parapublic carcerality is a significant conceptual contribution to the subfield of carceral studies in that it invites a shift in scholarly analysis from prison as a static, readymade punitive institution to carcerality as a tentacular (re)iterative site of regulatory social practice and meaning-making all while avoiding the analytic snares inherent to public/private dichotomization. Moreover, my project explores the ways in which the internal logic of the U.S. neoliberal racial state is operationalized and crystallized in modern carcerative sites and practices. That is, it considers the techniques by which the neoliberal racial state pits law against capital and courts against corporations in order to broker temporary socio-political balances that maintain hierarchies of social difference oriented toward white supremacy and black subjugation. More specifically, my project challenges the notion that the expansion of the U.S. prison state in the mid-20th century, as well as the emergence of profit-generating companies like Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) and the GEO Group (GEO)—firms which embody the praxis of parapublic carcerality—represents a unidirectional backlash to victories achieved during the modern civil rights movement. Instead, I argue that the emergence and expansion of such companies and practices, in part, is also a consequence of efforts to remedy the “problem” of prison crowding as defined by the federal courts. I contend that the federal courts throughout the 1970s and 1980s absorbed radical critiques of white supremacy in the form of lawsuits filed by black prisoners and their organizational allies like the NAACP and ACLU in two interrelated ways: 1) by reframing lawsuits explicitly filed to remedy racial injustice as a (neoliberal) colorblind issue of crowding and 2) by generally refusing to rule in favor of prisoners unless crowding allegations were central to their suits. And finally, my examination assesses the extent to which the praxis of parapublic carcerality is tethered to the larger project of neoliberal racial statecraft, a project of both “governance and a state of condition” in which whiteness serves as a proxy for social deservedness and blackness approximates criminality and what I term the “anti-citizen.”

N2  - Non‐compliance with treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) by an individual can put the community at risk of transmission of TB.
Public health (detention) orders can be issued to detain non‐compliant individuals, but this is a last resort and rarely used.
Two recent cases in New South Wales illustrate the process of issuing a public health order in NSW, and some of the issues that may arise.
The NSW law can also be applied to patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or HIV/AIDS.
The other states and territories have similar laws, which often apply to a broader range of diseases and have fewer limits on issuing and extending orders.

N2  - This paper presents prevalence rates by race/ethnicity and age for nine psychiatric and substance use disorders found in a random sample of 728 male jail detainees. Two thirds of the sample detainees had had a disorder other than antisocial personality during their lifetimes; half of these had had an episode within 2 weeks of the interview. More than 30% currently had either a severe mental disorder or a substance use disorder. Detainees with severe mental disorders or substance use disorders were most often in jail because they had committed nonviolent crimes. Policy implications of the results are discussed.

N2  - The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in young women inmates aged 17–21 located on the Youth Offenders Institute of HMP Holloway. The study consisted of a questionnaire and a urine sample for analysis. A health advisor administered a questionnaire to establish sociodemographic profile, sexual history and illicit drug use. C. trachomatis was diagnosed using a nucleic acid amplification test. Overall, the prevalence of C. trachomatis was 13.2%. Drug use was common with 41.2% using crack cocaine and 17.3% using intravenous heroin. A majority (80.2%) reported not using condoms during the last sexual encounter and 62.6% had a history of a previous pregnancy. Over half (53.3%) had a previous sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and 74.7% had never been previously diagnosed with a STI. Sexual health programmes in prisons should include screening as well as education about STI risk reduction and drug prevention.

N2  - President Reagan's budget director, David Stockman, once proposed that the federal government run up deficits so massive that the only recourse would be to slash social programs, derisively characterized as the "Nanny State." The social programs were opposed by those who never got over Franklin Roosevelt's election in 1932. Stockman recanted many years later, but we are now at the point that his proposal is close to being implemented. In the face of the national debt of many trillions of dollars and deficits growing by $1.5 trillion annually, we hear calls for a return to the days when taxes were low, the federal government was smaller, and social policies were guided by principles of the free market and compassionate conservatism. Given that harsh budget cuts at the federal and state levels are in the air, we may be moving in that direction. This article explores the question of what might happen if we drastically cut back on social welfare and regulatory programs that developed after 1932.

N2  - Australia has a history of migration, especially during the wars in Europe, but many have forgotten the difficulties underlying asylum and wars endured by their forefathers. Preventive, indefinite detention of asylum seekers, most of whom are found to be genuine refugees, impinges on their human rights. The mental and physical health consequences of detention in this already traumatised group are significant, particularly in children. There are abundant studies to support this but, even as these studies continue to be done, asylum seekers languish in detention centres. To be fully addressed, the health implications of detention cannot be considered in isolation, but must be considered frankly and openly by health professionals in the broader historical and political context within which they occur. If we do not do this, we risk turning a blind eye to, or even condoning, human rights abuses.

N2  - Background: Women entering jails are at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases; however, screening for chlamydial and gonococcal infection is not routinely performed in most jails. New urine tests have made it easier to screen for these infections in nonclinical settings. Goal: The feasibility and acceptability of urine-based screening for women entering jails and the prevalence of and treatment rates for chlamydial and gonococcal infections were determined. Study Design: Women entering jails in Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, Alabama; and Baltimore, Maryland, who signed consent forms were tested for chlamydial and gonococcal infection by means of the urine ligase chain reaction assay. Those testing positive were treated in jail; health department staff members attempted to contact those already released. Results: Most women who were approached agreed to be tested (range, 87-98%, depending on city), and most of these women provided a specimen (range, 92-100%). Among 5364 women aged 16 to 75 years who were tested, the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections was high, especially among those <25 years of age (range, 15.3-21.5% for chlamydial infection and 8.2-9.2% for gonorrhea, depending on city). The majority of women testing positive were treated in jail or outside of jail (61-85%). Conclusions: Screening women in jails for chlamydial and gonococcal infection with urine tests is feasible, is acceptable to most women, and leads to detection and treatment of many infections. Routine screening should reduce medical complications in this population and should prevent transmission in the community, given that many women are soon released.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs) among incarcerated boys, and comorbidity patterns and the relationship between SUDs and violent offending and. criminal recidivism. The presence of SUDs and other psychiatric disorders was assessed in a representative sample of 204 incarcerated boys aged 12 to 18 years using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). Ninety-two percent had used alcohol, 86% had used cannabis, and 33% had used other substances. The 6-month prevalence of SUDs was 55%, and 22% reported polysubstance abuse or dependence. SUDs were positively associated with comorbid externalizing and psychotic disorders. Substance dependence was negatively associated with violent offending but not with criminal recidivism. These high prevalence rates call for more attention to diagnosis and management of SUDs among incarcerated male adolescents. The negative association between substance dependence and the violent nature of the index offense needs further investigation.

N2  - Background Police and correctional officers face the occupational hazard of blood and body fluid exposures, which carry the risk of infection with HIV. Aims To estimate the incidence rate (IR) of emergency department (ED) visits for blood or body fluid exposures sustained by police and corrections officers in an entire state and to quantify the utilization of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in response to these exposures. Methods A retrospective study of police and corrections officers presenting to EDs in Rhode Island between 1995 and 2001. The investigators estimated IRs of ED visits for these exposures with 95% confidence intervals and determined factors associated with HIV PEP using bivariate Pearson's χ2 analyses. Results The average annual incidence of ED visits for blood or body fluid exposures over the study period was IR 4.41 (2.31–6.51) exposures per 1000 police and corrections personnel. Only 15% of officers sustained percutaneous injuries or blood-to-mucous membrane exposures. Sixteen officers were offered HIV PEP and 10 accepted it. Offering of HIV PEP was 3.3-fold greater for officers sustaining percutaneous and blood-to-mucous membrane exposures instead of other body fluid exposures. Conclusion The incidence of ED visits for blood or body fluid exposures by police and corrections officers was low and most exposures did not have the potential for HIV transmission. HIV PEP was infrequently used for these exposures.

N2  - Recent studies and policy documents have recognised the need for support for adolescent offenders under the age of 18 who experience both mental health and behavioural difficulties. Although mental health services are provided within all Young Offender Institution (YOIs), the level of provision is highly variable. Further, these services can find it difficult to meet the needs of young offenders whose mental health needs are compounded and inextricably linked with their behaviours. A specialist facility was established within an adolescent prison in North-West England to meet the needs of this population. The unit used a multi-agency approach in which prison officers worked in collaboration with mental health staff. This article describes the aims of the unit and reports on the first cohort of young people admitted; there were significant improvements in behavioural and social functioning across all three main outcome measures. Implications for future policy, service development and research are discussed.

N2  - The widening gap between supply and demand for renal transplantation has prompted many centers to use donors after cardiac death. Some of these donors exhibit signs of acute renal failure (ARF) prior to cardiac arrest. Concern has been expressed about poor quality of graft function from such donors. In response to this perception, we reviewed 49 single renal transplant recipients from category III donors after cardiac death between 1998 and 2005, at out center. All kidneys but one had hypothermic machine perfusion and viability testing prior to transplantation. According to the RIFLE criteria, nine recipients had kidneys from donors with “low severity pre‐arrest ARF”. The remainder of the recipients were used as control group. There was no statistical significant difference in delayed graft function and rejection rates between these two groups. Recipients GFR at 12 months was 44.4 ± 17.1 and 45.2 ± 14.7 (mL/min/1.73m2) from donors with ARF and without ARF, respectively (p = 0.96). In conclusion, low severity ARF in kidneys from controlled after cardiac death donors can be a reversible condition after transplantation. Short‐term results are comparable to the kidneys from same category donors without renal failure, providing that some form of viability assessment is implemented prior to transplantation.
Using RIFLE criteria to define severity of acute renal failure, this study found that kidneys from controlled Non‐Heart Beating donors with low severity pre‐arrest acute renal failure can be transplanted.

N2  - Despite increased interest in female psychopathy, more work is needed to establish commonalities between the nomological networks for psychopathy in men and women. The current study sought to advance understanding of affective deficits in female psychopathy, as assessed by the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Forty-eight female inmates were tested in an affect-startle paradigm involving passive viewing of emotional and neutral picture stimuli. Results showed that women scoring high on PCL-R psychopathy exhibited deficits in startle reactivity to unpleasant pictures, especially with regard to victim-distress scenes, highlighting a specific insensitivity to the vicarious distress of others. The deficient affective modulation was specific to interpersonal-affective features and not adult/child antisocial features. These data confirm deficits in affective responding among women high on psychopathy, with implications for fear- versus empathy-related conceptualizations of psychopathic women.

N2  - It was examined whether bulimia and dissociation are common in male self‐cutters, as has been found in female self‐cutters. The subjects were 796 male inmates of a juvenile prison. A self‐reporting questionnaire was used to assess self‐cutting, histories of psychoactive substance use, problem behaviors, and traumatic life events in the subjects. The Adolescent Dissociative Experience Scale and the Bulimia Investigatory Test of Edinburgh were also used. Subjects were divided into two groups: self‐cutting and non‐cutting. Questionnaire responses and dissociation and bulimia assessments were compared between the groups. Self‐cutters began smoking (P < 0.001) and drinking (P < 0.001) earlier, and more frequently used illicit psychoactive drugs (P < 0.001), experienced childhood physical abuse (P < 0.001), and reported suicide attempts (P < 0.001), suicidal ideation (P < 0.001), and outward violence toward a person (P < 0.001) or object (P < 0.001) than non‐cutters. Self‐cutters also scored significantly higher on the bulimia (P < 0.001) and dissociation tests (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that suicide attempt (odds ratio, 4.311) and suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 2.336) could discriminate between male inmates with and without self‐cutting. Male self‐cutters showed ‘multi‐impulsive bulimic’ tendencies resembling those of female self‐cutters, although to a lesser extent. Clinical features of male as opposed to female self‐cutters were influenced by gender differences.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relation of the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and engineering controls to infection control (IC) practices in a prison healthcare setting, and to explore the effect on IC practices of a perceived organizational commitment to safety.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: The study population was drawn from the 28 regional Correctional Health Care Workers Facilities in Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: All full-time Maryland correctional healthcare workers (HCWs) were surveyed, and 225 (64%) of the 350 responded.
METHOD: A confidential, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all correctional HCWs employed in the 28 Maryland Correctional Health Care Facilities. The questionnaire was analyzed psychometrically and validated through extensive pilot testing. It included items on three major constructs: IC practices, safety climate (defined as the perception of organizational commitment to safety), and availability of IC equipment and supplies.
RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the availability of PPE and IC practices. Similarly, a strong correlation was found between IC practices and the presence of engineering controls. In addition, an equally strong association was seen between the adoption of IC practices and employee perception of management commitment to safety. Those employees who perceived a high level of management support for safety were more than twice as likely to adhere to recommended IC practices. IC practices were significantly more likely to be followed if PPE was always readily available. Similarly, IC practices were more likely to be followed if engineering controls were provided.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ready availability of PPE and the presence of engineering controls are crucial to help ensure their use in this high-risk environment. This is especially important because correctional HCWs are potentially at risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses. Commitment to safety was found to be highly associated with the adoption of safe work practices. There is an inherent conflict of "custody versus care" in this setting; hence, it is especially important that we understand and appreciate the relation between safety climate and IC practices. Interventions designed to improve safety climate, as well as availability of necessary IC supplies and equipment, will most likely prove effective in improving employee compliance with IC practices in this healthcare setting (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2001;22:555-559).

N2  - Media reports frequently depict older adults as victims of deception. The public perceives these stories as particularly salient because older adults are seen as fragile victims taken advantage of because of trusting behaviors. This developmental investigation of deception detection examines older and younger adults interacting in 2 contexts, prison and the "free world," to discover whether older adults are vulnerable to deception. Younger prisoners were found to be lie biased. Older adults were better able to discriminate lies than younger adults, and this effect was localized primarily to older female adults. Findings indicate that discriminability strongly increases from younger to older age for women, whereas men do not show an improvement, as age increases, in making decisions about statement veracity.

N2  - Summary
The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of antiretroviral treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of three groups of HIV-positive inmates: those who are taking antiretroviral treatment, those who are not on treatment as it has not yet been indicated, and those who refuse to take treatment even though it has been recommended. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 585 HIV+ inmates in three prisons. The response variable was HRQOL. Independent variables were: sociodemographic variables, psychosocial and drug-related variables. Two multivariate linear regression models were constructed in order to determine the HRQOL, physical health score (PHS) and mental health score (MHS), for each of the three groups identified, using patients who refused treatment as the reference category. Patients who refused therapy had a lower MHS compared with patients in whom treatment was not indicated (P = 0.038). With regard to PHS, patients refusing therapy had a lower score than patients who were not indicated therapy (P = 0.005), and than patients receiving therapy (P = 0.010).

N2  - Kidneys transplanted from non-heart-beating donors (NHBDs) have been exposed to varying degrees of ischemic damage after death. Category III donors have invariably been managed, treated, and investigated in a hospital setting prior to arrest and death. Some therefore exhibit evidence of renal dysfunction and even acute renal failure (ARF) before death. Many surgeons would regard a NHBD with pre-arrest evidence of ARF as too marginal for renal transplantation. This retrospective study examines five Maastricht category III NHBD donors with evidence of pre-arrest ARF. We compare 3- and 12-month GFR outcome data from the nine resulting transplants with 40 category III NHBD transplants with normal pre-arrest renal function. The mean GFR at 3 months was 45.4 and 43.8 for the ARF and normal group, respectively. At 12 months the GFR was 42.2 and 44.7 in the ARF and normal groups, respectively. Thus evidence of ARF pre-arrest does not preclude successful category III NHBD renal transplantation.

N2  - Data from a convenience sample of 476 detained adolescents were used to examine the relationship between family influences and biologically confirmed sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Results indicated that frequent parental monitoring was negatively associated with STD infection and that this relationship was modified by age, gender, and race. Findings suggest that STD prevention efforts for detained adolescents (particularly high-risk minority females older than age 16) might focus on increasing monitoring by a parent or parental figure.

N2  - Objective: To compare demographic, behavioral, and geographic characteristics of incarcerated persons with AIDS and those of all persons with AIDS reported from January 1994 through December 1996.
Design: Population-based surveillance.
Setting: Medical records of persons for whom AIDS diagnosis was made in hospitals, clinics, and other settings (e.g., prisons) in the United States.
Patients: Adults (13 years or older) with AIDS reported from January 1994 through December 1996.
Results: Of the 220 000 AIDS cases in adults, 4% were reported in incarcerated persons. Compared with all persons with AIDS, a higher proportion were male (89% versus 82%), black (58% versus 39%), younger at time of diagnosis (35 versus 37 years), had injected drugs (61% versus 27%), and were reported on the basis of the 1993 immunologic criteria (71% versus 50%). Fewer cases in incarcerated persons were diagnosed at death (3% versus 10%). The South (38%) and the Northeast (37%) United States accounted for the largest proportion of incarcerated persons. The 1996 AIDS rate for incarcerated persons (199 per 100 000) was six times the national rate of 31 per 100 000. Among persons incarcerated at time of diagnosis, rates for women were higher than for men (287 versus 185 per 100 000) and higher for blacks and Hispanics than for whites (253, 313, and 100 per 100 000, respectively). By state of report, Connecticut had the highest rate among incarcerated persons (1348 per 100 000).
Conclusion: These data illustrate differences in demographic, behavioral, and geographic characteristics of incarcerated persons compared with all persons with AIDS. However, they reflect only the minimum numbers of incarcerated persons with AIDS in the United States. Our results highlight the need for state health departments to work with correctional systems to ensure accurate and timely reporting of AIDS cases and to develop HIV prevention, education, and treatment both in prison and on release into the community.

N2  - Background: Concerns raised by opponents to condom provision in prisons have not been objectively examined and the issue continues to be debated. The long-term effects of the introduction of condoms and dental dams into New South Wales (NSW) prisons in 1996 was examined, focusing on particular concerns raised by politicians, prison officers, prison nurses and prisoners. These groups were worried that (a) condoms would encourage prisoners to have sex, (b) condoms would lead to an increase in sexual assaults in prisons, (c) prisoners would use condoms to hide and store drugs and other contraband and (d) prisoners would use condoms as weapons. Method: Data sources included the NSW Inmate Health Survey (IHS) from 1996 and 2001 and official reports from the NSW Department of Corrective Services. The 1996 IHS involved 657 men and 132 women randomly selected from all prisons, with a 90% response rate. The 2001 survey involved 747 men and 167 women inmates, with an 85% response rate. Results: There was a decrease in reports of both consensual male-to-male sex and male sexual assaults 5 years after the introduction of condoms into prisons in 1996. The contents of condom kits were often used for concealing contraband items and for other purposes, but this was not associated with an increase in drug injecting in prison. Only three incidents of a condom being used in assaults on prison officers were recorded between 1996 and 2005; none was serious. Conclusions: There exists no evidence of serious adverse consequences of distributing condoms and dental dams to prisoners in NSW. Condoms are an important public health measure in the fight against HIV and sexually transmitted diseases; they should be made freely available to prisoners as they are to other high-risk groups in the community.

N2  - Chronic disease management is becoming increasingly important in correctional settings, especially diabetes. We conducted a retrospective chart review of diabetic inmates in San Francisco County Jail and examined the sociodemographic characteristics, markers of disease status, and compliance with jail-specific care guidelines within this setting. We found high rates of compliance with immediate-term care guidelines (e.g., finger-stick glucose and blood pressure checks at intake) but less success in providing the more complex care required for chronic diseases. Inmates’ age, race, and gender did not affect likelihood of meeting guidelines.

N2  - Our aim was to determine the incidence of tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion in the Maryland state correctional system. We conducted a historical longitudinal cohort study. A sample of 1,289 inmates, incarcerated in 16 of 23 prisons, who had a negative TST and a second test within 24 months was selected. The incidence of recent conversion was 6.3 per 100 person-years. Risk factors for conversion included high prison-population density (relative risk [RR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5–3.8) and incarceration in a higher-security institution (RR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4–4.3). Incarceration in an institution with higher levels of isoniazid prophylaxis (>65% of TST positives) reduced the risk of infection by 50% (RR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.7). Crowding was strongly correlated with risk of conversion (r = 0.83; P < .001), while rates of isoniazid prophylaxis initiation were inversely correlated with risk of infection (r = 00.82; P < .001). In stepwise regression, higher prison-population density was the strongest predictor of increased infection. In a final model, inclusion of the rate of isoniazid prophylaxis initiation reduced the risk associated with crowding (RR = 1.4; P = .4). Annual screening programs for prisons can identify recent conversions that may not otherwise be detected.

N2  - This study explores the relationships among trauma severity, initial trauma reactions, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and dissociation in a group of 98 former East‐German political prisoners. Trauma severity and initial reactions were assessed using a persecution checklist and a coping process questionnaire. PTSD symptoms were assessed through a structured clinical interview. Chronic dissociation was evaluted using the Dissociative Experiences Scale. The two assumptions of the study were confirmed by structural equation modeling: (I) Lifetime PTSD symptoms were predominantly predicted by initial reactions to trauma and (2) chronic dissociation was predominantly predicted by trauma severity. The first finding is discussed in relation to the participants' initial trauma processing. The second finding is discussed especially in the context of trauma duration and dissociation‐prone coping attempts. Limitations concerning the long‐term interval between traumatization and data collection are discussed.

N2  - Although the number of mothers with histories of drug addiction who are incarcerated has grown substantially in recent years, there is little information on their unique characteristics and vulnerability. Undertaken to address this issue, this study examined data on 167 incarcerated drug-abusing mothers from Baltimore City who had volunteered for a parenting program offered at a Maryland correctional facility. Prior to entering this program, mothers who consented to participate completed a battery of assessment measures, which included an extensive interview covering their early developmental and current experiences, along with standardized instruments measuring psychological adjustment and parenting satisfaction. Analyses of these data focused on the link between risk/protective factor information drawn from the early development experiences of the mothers and their current adjustment status. Results revealed significant relationships between higher risk levels and less favorable current adjustment. Implications of the findings of the study for both prevention and clinical intervention efforts targeting both mothers and their children are discussed.

N2  - Surveys of incarcerated offenders and arrestees consistently report high rates of both alcohol and drug use in this population. This drug-crime connection has highlighted the need to learn more not only about drug treatment effectiveness, but also about drug treatment utilization. While studies have begun to examine drug treatment utilization, most of these studies have been based on urban substance abusers. Little is known about the extent to which urban and rural substance abusers may be different in terms of treatment utilization. This study, therefore, examines differences between urban and rural drug use patterns and treatment utilization among chronic drug abusers to determine whether, and in what ways, rurality may affect substance abuse and treatment seeking. The study examines these issues in a group of chronic drug users who were incarcerated at the time of the study. Findings show significant differences in drug use and treatment utilization of urban and rural offenders. Chronic drug abusers from rural and very rural areas have significantly higher rates of lifetime drug use, as well as higher rates of drug use in the 30 days prior to their current incarceration than chronic drug abusers from urban areas. Nonetheless, being from a very rural area decreased the likelihood of having ever been in treatment after controlling for the number of years using and race. While problem recognition appears to explain much of the effect of very rural residence on treatment utilization for alcohol abuse, the effects of being from a very rural area on seeking treatment for drug abuse remain statistically significant even after controlling for several other variables. The findings point to the importance of providing culturally appropriate education to very rural communities on the benefits of substance abuse treatment and of providing substance abuse treatment within the criminal justice system.

N2  - Background: In order to demonstrate the feasibility of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related risk behaviour surveillance in European prisons, a multicentre pilot study was undertaken. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in six European prisons (France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Scotland and Sweden). Inmates were invited to complete a self-administered and anonymous questionnaire and to give a saliva sample in order to test for HIV antibodies. Results: Eight hundred and forty-seven out of 1,124 inmates participated in the survey (response rate 75%). Saliva from 817 inmates (73%) was collected and processed for HIV antibodies. Twenty-seven per cent reported that they had ever injected drugs and 49% of these reported they had injected whilst in prison. Eighteen per cent of inmates reported that they had been tattooed whilst in prison, which was found to be higher among injecting drug users (IDUs). One and sixteen per cent reported that they had ever had homosexual and heterosexual intercourse in prison respectively. The HIV prevalence among IDUs was 4% (versus 1% among non-IDUs) (p=0.02). The proportions of inmates previously tested for hepatitis C and vaccinated against hepatitis B were 24 and 16% respectively. Conclusion: This survey demonstrates the feasibility of cross-sectional surveys in European prison inmates and highlights the importance of surveillance of HIV prevalence and related risk behaviour among inmates. The continuing high HIV prevalence and potential for HIV spread in prisons should encourage decision makers in implementing or enhancing harm reduction and education programmes and substance abuse treatment services in prison.

N2  - This thesis examines the motif of skin in both its material and symbolic manifestations in contemporary Latin American art. More specifically, it seeks to trace the presence of an “epidermal aesthetics” in a selection of works by artists active in Chile and Argentina over a period ranging from 1973 to the present. Taking 1973 as its starting point, my temporal frame coincides with the military coup staged by the Chilean armed forces and their implementation of a dictatorial regime that would last until 1989. Meanwhile, a violent military Junta also ruled over Argentina between 1976 and 1983. My contention is that, in their (re-)activation of a patriarchal and hetero-normative discourse, these regimes affirmed their power by resorting to a virile rhetoric that built itself on and against the bodies of women. By claiming a right to define the feminine and by associating it with the image of the Nation (Patria), the Chilean and Argentine Juntas effectively turned the skins of thousands of women into screens upon which they could project their propagandistic discourses. In this thesis, I examine the stakes of this particularly stringent form of political repression for female embodiment. Far from taking women as mere victims of state violence though, I argue that artists also found in the motif of the skin an appropriate topos to articulate practices of resistance which, by extension, led to a redeployment of the artistic field as one inhabited by “epidermal aesthetics”. If skin can constitute a carceral wall locking women inside themselves and a screen for the projection of idealised images of femininity, it also constitutes an interface to reinitiate contact with the other. Moreover, as the ground activating the sense of touch, skin is anathema to the visual hegemony imposed by the military governments’ policies of surveillance, repression and disappearance.

N2  - The records of 185 inmates rated on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) as part of a forensic evaluation for the US federal courts were reviewed for evidence of subsequent disciplinary reports in a 2-year follow-up. The Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) was also administered to 149 of these inmates. The PCL-R Factor 2 score added significant predictive variance at the second step of a logistic regression analysis of disciplinary report outcome after demographics (age, education, ethnic status) and scores on the PAI Aggression Scale had been entered at step 1. The PAI Aggression Scale also displayed incremental validity by successfully predicting the presence of a subsequent disciplinary report at step 2 of a logistic regression analysis after age, education, ethnic status, and the PCL-R Factor 2 score had been entered at step 1. These and other results suggest that self-report measures may be just as effective as non-self-report rating scales in predicting forensic and correctional outcomes.

N2  - From the time of Ermak's conquest in 1582, Siberia has both served and been envisaged as a carceral space, a land of exile and punishment. In the modern era, this image has proliferated and endured both within Russia itself and on the international stage. For many Russians and Westerners alike, Siberia has long provided fertile ground for mythmaking about Russia, and has become a byword for and synecdoche of political oppression and the evils of autocratic and totalitarian rule. In this thesis, I argue that representations of Siberian exile played a crucial role in transnationalising the Russian revolution during the decades prior to 1917. Throughout the nineteenth century, the image of Siberia as a vast prison camp - and, by extension, the birthplace of revolutionary heroes - was commonplace in the oral and literary traditions of Russia's radical intelligentsia and amongst Anglo-American progressives alike. In both cases, Siberia represented an indictment of the Tsarist state and, to some extent, prefigured Russia's post-autocratic future. From the 1880s onwards, a succession of Russian émigrés in Britain and the United States duly sought to capitalise on their hosts' fascination with Siberia by publicising dramatic tales of political exiles' mistreatment and heroism in captivity. Tracing the development of this discourse, I demonstrate that although it elevated several revolutionaries to international celebrity status and succeeded in securing considerable overseas support for their cause, it also exposed contradictions in how the revolution was understood inside and outside Russia. As Russian socialists used the rhetoric of punishment and protest to articulate their own ideological convictions, Britons and Americans romanticised and projected themselves upon the mythologised figure of the Siberian prisoner. In this sense, fin de siècle polemics over Siberian exile can be seen to anticipate Western anxieties over Russian oppositionists prevalent in our own time.

N2  - This project explores the contemporary history of segregation in Scottish prisons, focusing on measures of ‘special handling’ particularly the network of small units that was operative between the 1950s and the 1990s. Scotland has a complicated, troubling, idiosyncratic and, to a lesser degree, inspiring tradition of special handling measures, involving generic punishment blocks, anachronistic isolation units, highly innovative specialist units, ‘safe’ and ‘silent’ cells, and more collective segregation spaces such as vulnerable prisoners wings. Such sites have provoked considerable attention across public and political arenas; they have been sources of shame, pride, criticism and confusion; in specific penal moments, they have been experienced by prisoners (and officers) as warzones, sanctuaries, coffins and creative spaces; and, in terms of efficacy, they have both exacerbated and ameliorated the behavioural difficulties of the prisoners contained within them. The objectives of this research are (1) to chronologically map the evolution of key segregation sites, attending to the external pressures that have informed the policies, procedures and rules governing their protean use, (2) to explore the impact of particular environmental factors on the initial design, operation and, subsequently, the closure of these sites, and (3) to reflect on the relationship between space and the ways individuals have understood, coped with, and in various ways ‘acted-out’ their segregated confinement. Deciding who, how and why to segregate prisoners raises questions of a conceptual, operational, political, and moral nature. But deciding where to segregate prisoners situates such questions within the physical constraints and potentialities of space. By adopting a spatial-temporal approach, this research straddles disciplines, utilising the methods of penal history, prison sociology, and – though in a more approximate manner – the steadily burgeoning sub-discipline of carceral geography. Additionally, by marshalling a number of personal testimonies, this history attempts to capture the emotional resonances of segregation – how it feels to actually live and work in ‘prisons within prisons’.

N2  - Three epidemiologically linked multi drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in 1990–1991 involving New York State (NYS) inmates suggested MDR-TB was widespread in NYS prisons. Inmate lists were linked to 1990–1992 TB registries, medical records were reviewed, and movement histories for inmates with MDR-TB were examined within and between prisons and hospitals. In 1990–1991, 171 inmates were diagnosed with TB. This rate (156.2/100,000) was significantly higher than the 1990–1991 US rate (10.4/100,000) and the 1986 rate among NYS inmates (105.5/100,000). Of 171 cases, 155 were culture-confirmed; 37 (32%) of 116 with drug susceptibilities determined had MDR-TB. Two other inmates with TB before 1990 were diagnosed with MDR-TB in 1990–1991. Of 39 inmates with MDR-TB, 38 (97%) were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and 34 (87%) have died. These 39 lived in 23 of the 68 NYS prisons while potentially infectious; 12 were transferred through 20 prisons while ill with MDR-TB. Policies of correctional systems on infection control and inmate transfers need to be reevaluated to prevent spread of TB.

N2  - Calls to 'defund the police', abolish the penal system and demolish prisons most recently entered mainstream consciousness during the 2020 racial justice protests in the US. Such slogans may at first seem provocative and radical. Some might even dismiss them as disruptive, irrational and unrealistic. Nevertheless, for almost six decades Angela Davis has demanded to challenge the carceral logics that lay the blueprint for modern societies. She stands firm in her belief that reimagining justice through the abolition of prisons also means transforming into a society that no longer relies on the repressive effects of violence. Born in 1944 in Birmingham AL, Davis grew up in a society where segregation was racial, spatial, and upheld and protected by civic society and law enforcement; Jim Crow racial segregation laws were still enforced. Every aspect of life was 'separate but equal', and transgressions were routinely policed or met with violence, many times deadly. This early life experience of segregation and racial terror encouraged her to demonstrate how space and the built environment are integral to combating all forms of oppression, and how all struggles for justice are also spatial struggles.

N2  - Objectives: This study was performed to assess the prevalence of behavioral risk factors and correlates of poor self-reported health among incarcerated women in a county jail in Oregon. Methods: The authors collected self-reported data from recently incarcerated women at a county jail, focusing on prevalence of high-risk health behaviors, history of health care use, history of physical and sexual abuse, and health care coverage. The authors assessed factors associated with poor self-reported health using logistic regression techniques. Results: More than half of the participants reported a history of intravenous drug use, 67% reported a history of sexual abuse, 79% reported a history of physical abuse, and 43% stated that they had a history of trading sex for money or drugs. Two factors were associated with poor self-reported health: history of physical assault (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4, 5.2) and use of heroin during the month prior to arrest (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.3, 6.6). Conclusions: The high prevalence of health risk behaviors among the inmates suggests a number of areas for intervention. These findings may also be used to guide topics addressed during intake interviews of new inmates, and to help identify inmates that require additional medical or social services.

N2  - Risk for jail or prison recidivism is well documented among incarcerated individuals with schizophrenia. However, it is less clear that risk is also high for psychiatric hospital readmission after accounting for mediating influences such as psychopathology severity, functioning level, substance misuse, and demographic characteristics. Relative to counterparts without prior time in jail, this study therefore assessed whether formerly incarcerated individuals with schizophrenia were more likely to repeatedly use hospital care after controlling for level of functioning and symptomatology. Among 315 inpatients, former inmates had a greater mean number of previous hospital stays than other patients (t = −2.13; df = 305; p = 0.03) and were more likely to visit the emergency room or be rehospitalized within 3 months of discharge (χ = 8.83; df = 1; p = 0.003). They were twice as likely to be readmitted, moreover, even after accounting in logistic regression for age, sex, race, global functioning, psychopathology severity, alcohol abuse or dependence, and drug abuse or dependence (OR = .49; CI = .26–.95). Implications for community care are discussed, and the suggestion is made that jail diversion programs should be renamed and refocused as “jail and hospital diversion.”

N2  - This study assessed both prevalence rates of substance dependence and level of treatment need among recently-incarcerated prisoners in a southeastern state. Participants were 752 consecutive admissions to the state prison system in 2002. They were administered the 93-item Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI). The results indicated that approximately 72% of participants met criteria for substance dependence and 46% of participants met criteria for prison-based residential treatment. The results of this study can be used to inform allocation of prison-based treatment resources.

N2  - Although the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among prison inmates is reported to be high, little is known about anti-HIV treatment patterns in correctional institutions. The present study assessed antiretroviral prescribing patterns for 2360 Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) inmates infected with HIV. In 1998, 66.8% of all TDCJ inmates infected with HIV who had CD4 lymphocyte counts <500 cells/mm3 were treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, no substantial differences in the use of HAART were exhibited according to the sociodemographic factors under study. While the majority of inmates receiving HAART in 1998 were prescribed a combination of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and 1 protease inhibitor, 11.2% were prescribed a combination of 2 NRTIs and 1 non-NRTI. In view of the elevated rate of HIV infection in correctional settings, it will be important to continue to document the pharmacotherapy patterns among prison inmates, both during and following incarceration.

N2  - Encryption is commonly understood as a technology which can provide universal privacy protection and as a countersurveillance tool. However, researchers have recently criticized crypto advocates for ignoring questions of race and of narrowing countersurveillance advocacy to circumscribed technosolutions. This chapter adds to this growing scholarship by presenting an analysis of how race has shaped the development and regulation of encryption technologies. Drawing on a discourse analysis of US federal congressional hearings from 1990 to 2016 (the so-called "Crypto Wars"), we demonstrate how state and private actors mobilized racialized mythological constructions of criminals in negotiating how to regulate encryption. We conclude it is important to center the systematically racist carceral culture of the US in seemingly disconnected areas such as the policy debates of the Crypto Wars.

N2  - Summary
Objective  To estimate the prevalence and causes of vitamin A deficiency disorders (VADD) in adult male prisoners in Nakuru, Kenya.
Methods  A total of 1048 male prisoners aged ≥16 years in Nakuru Government of Kenya prison in Nakuru, Kenya were examined by an ophthalmologist for signs of xerophthalmia. Two hundred and forty‐one cases with xerophthalmia and 448 controls randomly selected from the remaining prison population were interviewed about risk factors for xerophthalmia and blood samples were taken to measure serum retinol and haemoglobin.
Results  23.6% (95% CI = 21.1–26.3%) of examined inmates showed at least one sign of xerophthalmia, mostly night blindness (98.8% of cases). In the case–control study, the age‐adjusted analyses showed that xerophthalmia was associated with age, length of imprisonment and previous imprisonment. Men with xerophthalmia were significantly more likely be in poor health characterised by significant illness, recent hospital admission, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fever or chronic illness. After multivariate adjustment, duration of imprisonment remained strongly associated with xerophthalmia (OR comparing >4 years with <6 months = 20.1, 95% CI = 8.3–48.8). Previous imprisonment, fever, diarrhoea, hospital admission and chronic illness were also significant predictors. Serum retinol levels were significantly lower in cases than controls, while there was no difference in haemoglobin levels.
Conclusion  Vitamin A deficiency was a significant public health problem among these Kenyan male prisoners, indicating that it may be important in vulnerable groups other than young children and pregnant or lactating women.
Objectif  Estimer la prévalence et les causes des troubles de déficience en vitamine A chez les prisonniers masculins adultes à Nakuru au Kenya.
Méthodes  1048 prisonniers masculins âgés de plus de 16 ans dans la prison gouvernementale de Nakuru au Kenya ont été examinés par un ophtalmologue pour des signes de xérophtalmie. 241 cas de xérophtalmie et 448 cas contrôles aléatoirement choisis dans le reste de la population carcérale, ont été interviewés au sujet des facteurs de risque pour la xérophtalmie. Des échantillons de sang ont été prélevés pour la mesure du taux de rétinol dans le sérum et de l'hémoglobine.
Résultats  23,6% (IC95%: 21,1‐26,3) des détenus examinés présentaient au moins un signe de xérophtalmie, la plupart du temps de l'héméralopie (98,8% des cas). Dans l’étude cas/contrôle, les ajustements pour l’âge ont révélé une association de la xérophtalmie avec l’âge, la durée de l'emprisonnement et un emprisonnement précédent. Les hommes avec xérophtalmie étaient plus probables d’être de santé précaire caractérisée par des maladies sérieuses, une admission récente à l'hôpital, une toux persistante, de la diarrhée, de la fièvre ou une maladie chronique. Après un ajustement multivarié, la durée de l'emprisonnement restait fortement associée avec la xérophtalmie (OR = 20,1, IC95%: 8,3‐48,8 pour la comparaison entre emprisonnement de plus 4 années à celui de moins de 6 mois). Un emprisonnement précédent, la fièvre, la diarrhée, l'admission à l'hôpital et la maladie chronique étaient également des facteurs prédictifs importants. Les taux sériques de rétinol étaient significativement plus bas chez les cas que chez les contrôles alors qu'il n'y avait aucune différence dans les taux d'hémoglobine.
Conclusion  La déficience en vitamine A est un problème important de santé publique chez ces prisonniers masculins kenyans, indiquant que cette déficience peut aussi être importante dans des groupes vulnérables autres que les jeunes enfants et les femmes enceintes ou allaitantes.
Objetivo  Estimar la prevalencia y las causas de los desórdenes por deficiencia de Vitamina A (DDVA) en hombres adultos, prisioneros en Nakuru, Kenia.
Métodos  1048 prisioneros, con edad ≥16 años, internados en la prisión gubernamental de Nakuru, Kenya fueron examinados por un oftalmólogo en busca de signos de xeroftalmia. Se seleccionaron al azar 241 casos de xeroftalmia y 448 controles de entre la población carcelaria. Se les realizó una entrevista acerca de los factores de riesgo para xeroftalmia y se les tomó una muestra de sangre para cuantificar los niveles de retinol y hemoglobina en suero.
Resultados  23.6% (95% IC = 21.1 a 26.3%) de los reclusos examinados tenían al menos un signo de xeroftalmia, principalmente ceguera nocturna (98.8% de los casos). En el estudio caso control, el análisis ajustado por edad mostró que la xeroftalmia estaba asociada con la edad, la duración del encarcelamiento y el haber estado previamente en prisión. Los hombres con xeroftalmia eran significativamente más propensos a tener una mala salud, caracterizada por enfermedades significantes, una admisión hospitalaria reciente, tos persistente, diarrea, fiebre o enfermedades crónicas. Después de un ajuste multivariado, la duración del encarcelamiento estaba fuertemente asociada a la xeroftalmia (OR comparando >4 años a <6 meses = 20.1, 95% IC = 8.3–48.8). El haber estado previamente en prisión, la fiebre, la diarrea, las admisiones hospitalarias y las enfermedades crónicas también eran predictores significativos. Los niveles de retinol en suero eran significativamente menores en los casos que en los controles, mientras que no había diferencia en los niveles de hemoglobina.
Conclusión  La deficiencia de Vitamina A era un problema de salud pública significativo entre estos prisioneros keniatas, indicando que esta patología podría ser importante en grupos vulnerables diferentes a losde niños pequeños y mujeres embarazadas o lactando.

N2  - Background: Over the past decades a number of studies have appeared on suicide among persons in jail and prison remand settings, and sentenced prisoners. In these papers contradictory views concerning the relation between suicide risk and length of custody were published. Methods: This article reports on a study that investigated all suicides (n=206) in all 29 Austrian jails and prisons between 1975 and 1996. The authors demonstrate the necessity to calculate the hazard that reflects the suicide risk in relation to time. Results: The results suggest three different periods of high suicide risk: immediately after admission and 2 months thereafter for prisoners on remand; for long-term prisoners the suicide risk correlates with the length of the sentence and slightly increases with the time of custody. Conclusions: With this knowledge, suicide prevention programmes in prisons and jails could be made more effective and economic.

N2  - Taiwan is experiencing an outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus infection among injection drug users. The purpose of the study was to determine the impact of a Transtheoretical Model-based HIV education program among drug-dependent inmates. A single group pre/post design was used to evaluate shortened impacts among 136 inmates who were arrested for illicit drug use and had attended a brief HIV education program in 2005. A repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated positive changes in AIDS knowledge (F > = 104.16, p < 0.001), self-efficacy to reduce HIV-risk behaviors (F = 26.5, p < 0.001), and readiness of change on substance use (F = 4.83, p = 0.03). The study findings showed that a brief TTM-based HIV education program can be effective for drug-dependent inmates.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the self-reported needs of women in jail who indicated a need for drug abuse services. METHODS: A total of 165 interviews were conducted of women held in a large, urban county jail in Ohio in May 1999. RESULTS: Drug-abusing women were more likely to report a need for housing, mental health counseling, education, job training, medical care, family support, and parenting assistance when released from jail. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of drug abuse treatment referrals to women in jail may not break the continual cycle of drug use and incarceration if other needs cannot be addressed.

N2  - OBJECTIVES:This paper describes research that examined the association between high-risk sexual and drug-using behaviors during incarceration and HIV infection for African-American men receiving HIV care at three public medical centers in Los Angeles County (LAC), California.
METHODS:A case-control study was conducted in which 305 HIV-infected African-American men and 305 neighborhood controls, ages 20 to 49, were frequency-matched by age.
RESULTS:After controlling for anal sex while not incarcerated, we found no association between anal sex during incarceration and HIV (odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.6-2.2). Among men with a history of incarceration (n = 332), the percentage reporting anal sex with men outside of incarceration (45%) was greater than those reporting anal sex while incarcerated (16%). Injection drug use (IDU) during incarceration was also not associated with HIV when controlling for IDU outside of incarceration (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.5- 4.9). Increased time in jail or prison was associated with less HIV infection (p = .001).
CONCLUSIONS:Although high-risk behaviors are more common in the community than in the incarcerated setting for this study group, incarcerated populations represent a high-risk group for whom access to prevention messages is limited. Periods of incarceration represent a unique opportunity to convey prevention messages that focus on high-risk behaviors outside the incarcerated setting.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The median incidence rate of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among prisoners is 7 times higher than for the general population. Yet high-risk sexual activity and drug use in US correctional facilities remain unexamined. This study explores inmate perceptions of high-risk behavior in New York state prisons and New York City jails and seeks to generate hypotheses to inform policies and future research. METHODS: Participants were 22 former New York state prisoners and 28 current New York City inmates. Participants attended one of six focus groups and completed an anonymous questionnaire. Audiotapes of the groups were transcribed and evaluated. RESULTS: A range of consensual and nonconsensual sexual activity occurs among inmates and between inmates and staff. Without official access to latex barriers, prisoners use ineffective makeshift devices, like rubber gloves and used plastic wrap, in attempts to practice safer sex. Prisoners also shoot drugs intravenously with used syringes and pieces of pens and light bulbs. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of harm-reduction devices behind bars may create a greater risk of HIV transmission there than in the community. Officials should consider distributing risk-reduction devices to prisoners through anonymous methods.

N2  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among inmates entering the New South Wales correctional system and to examine risk factors for infection.
Design: Cross‐sectional survey.
Setting: Reception Centre at Long Bay Correctional Centre, Sydney, New South Wales, June to December 1994.
Participants: 408 adult male inmates received at the Reception Centre (28% of the 1450 new inmates eligible for compulsory HIV testing).
Outcome measures: Presence of HBV core and surface antibody and surface antigen; HCV antibody; risk factors; inmates' knowledge about risk factors.
Results: 37% of inmates tested positive for HCV antibody, 31% for HBV core antibody and 3.2% for HBV surface antigen (indicating recent infection or carrier status). Among those who reported a history of injecting illegal drugs, rates rose to 66% for HCV antibody and 43% for HBV core antibody. Prevalence of HBV and HCV antibodies was similar in Aboriginal and non‐Aboriginal inmates, but HBV antigen carrier rate was significantly higher among Aboriginals (12% versus 2.2%). Knowledge about hepatitis risk factors was poor (only 20% named injecting drug use), although recidivists were significantly better informed than those new to the correctional system. Multivariate analysis identified injecting drug use, past exposure to hepatitis B virus and previous imprisonments as significant predictors for HCV infection, and age over 25 years and HCV antibodies for HBV infection.
Conclusions: Results suggest that about a third of adult male prisoners entering the NSW correctional system may have been infected with HBV or HCV. Measures such as education about hepatitis risk factors and HBV vaccination are needed to reduce hepatitis transmission in this population.

N2  - Ethical issues that can arise in distinguishing public health research from practice are highlighted in 2 case studies—an investigation of a tuberculosis outbreak in a prison and an evaluation of a program for improving HIV prevention services.
Regardless of whether such public health investigations represent research or practice, we see a need for ethics oversight procedures that reflect actual risks and enable timely responses to crises.
Such oversight should accommodate the perspectives of persons and communities affected by public health threats and by governmental responses to those threats; it should further recognize that public health ethics is a distinct field combining bioethics, political philosophy, human rights, and law.

N2  - This study aims to provide a framework for assessing and modelling behavioural changes in a prison therapeutic community. A behavioural checklist was devised to monitor both positive and negative behaviours throughout the course of therapy, paying particular attention to offence-paralleling behaviours. Content analysis of therapy notes on 68 residents identified 35 variables. The study investigated the hypothesis that it is possible to model behavioural change over the course of therapy using an action systems framework. This framework has been used to classify different forms of anti-social behaviour and pro-social behaviour. The four modes of action system functioning were consistently identified during therapy using smallest space analysis. Paired sample t tests of residents at the beginning and end periods of therapy suggested that residents progress from anti-social to pro-social behaviours from within each mode. Overall, findings support the prison therapeutic community treatment model, and demonstrate the appropriateness of the action systems framework for understanding the nature and function of positive and negative therapeutic behaviours.

N2  - This study describes behaviors generally recognised as bullying among male and female prisoners, with a subsidiary aim of comparing adult and young offenders. The study also describes the different groups involved in bullying and provides a description of the ways in which victims react to their victimization. It was predicted that gender and prison category differences would be found across the different types of bullying, with females reporting more indirect forms than males, who would report more direct forms. It was also predicted that young offenders would report more bullying than adults. The sample consisted of 98 young offenders (21 female and 77 male) and 211 adult offenders (53 female and 158 male). Inmates were surveyed via a self‐report behavior checklist (Direct and Indirect Prisoner behavior Checklist: DIPC). More than half of the sample reported being bullied and more than half reported to have “bullied others” at least once in the past week. Males and young offenders were more likely to report bullying others than females and adults, respectively. Males were more likely than females to report bullying others both directly and indirectly. Four different groups of inmates were identified: bullies, bully/victims, pure victims, and not involved. These categories varied in different gender and prison status groups. Victims reported reacting predominantly by crying, staying in their cell when they could be out, and trying to get moved. Aggr. Behav. 25:161–178, 1999. © 1999 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

N2  - Ethnographic above all, this chapter focuses on the impact of electronic monitoring (EM) on the daily lives of convicts both within and beyond prison walls. The first section describes the functioning of EM technology from the perspective of convicts serving their sentences in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, emphasizing the conflicted synergy of the monitored body and the device that organizes its circulation. The common thread consists in the personal account of Anderson, subject to EM while serving his sentence in metropolitan São Paulo. The second part of the chapter analyzes the modes of subjectivation implied in EM and their articulation with the physical violence endemic to São Paulo’s carceral complex. Departing from the experience of Deivid, a convict who was tortured by prison guards owing to a supposed infringement of his judicially imposed motion profile, I draw inspiration from several authors dealing with the neoliberal paradigm of individualized responsibilization and show how, in the Brazilian penal system, this paradigm is mediated through an excess of institutionalized violence. Following on, the third part draws upon field research conducted in Maranhão, one of Brazil’s poorest states. The section raises questions about the simultaneity between ‘modernization’ and precariousness in the Maranhão penal system and discusses the effects of power and de-subjectivation implied by electronic surveillance programs. The final section of the chapter is devoted to the less obvious implications of EM devices upon convicts’ daily lives, notably as they unfold in urban settings governed by criminal gangs, armed militias, and abusive police forces. Based upon the personal accounts of monitored prisoners in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Ceará, and São Paulo, I show how the subject marked and stigmatized by the EM device becomes a steady target of persecutions and assaults, thus facing a quasi-constant threat of death.

N2  - Study objectives: To determine the prevalence of insomnia complaints and possible causes among prisoners. Design: Prospective study of medical consultations during 1 year (questionnaire A) to identify reasons for consultation and diagnoses. After this year we compared the medical records (questionnaire B) of 112 non-substance misusing (NSM) insomniac prisoners identified through questionnaire A with the records of 103 NSM prisoners without insomnia complaint. Setting: Outpatient service of the remand prison in Geneva, Switzerland. Patients: 995 prisoners. Interventions: None. Measurements and results: The general practitioners returned completed questionnaires A for 92% (n = 2772) of the consultations (995 patients). Using questionnaire A and B, we identified 112 NSM insomnia patients. Among these, chronic forms of insomnia were more common than transitory insomnia (<3 weeks). The most frequently reported reason for insomnia was anxiety related to incarceration. A higher percentage of the 112 insomnia patients than of the 103 non-insomnia patients had a history of medical and psychiatric illness, suffered from anxiety or depression in prison, and received prescriptions of psychotropic and analgesic medications. After the study of the records, we estimated the overall prevalence of insomnia at 44.3% of the 995 patients of whom 51% (n = 223) were drug misusers. Conclusions: Our results confirm that insomnia is a frequent complaint among prisoner patients and that at least half of insomnia patients are substance misusers. In NSM patients, insomnia does not seem to be an only transitory problem of adaptation to incarceration, but a more chronic problem lasting more than 3 weeks, related to a higher degree of medical and psychological problems before and during incarceration.

N2  - The combination of growing opposition to mass incarceration, the evolution of the technologies of e-carceration, and the intransigence of those who remain loyal to the prison-industrial complex is driving us toward a hybrid system of punishment. This hybrid will contain two parts: The first is the existing prisons, jails, immigration detention centers, and other carceral institutions that continue to physically confine people under the authority of the criminal legal and homeland security systems. We can label the second component “open-air prisons,” or a collection of institutions, programs, and practices that exist outside the walls of traditional prisons. Some of these,

N2  - The factors associated with depression and anxiety disorders in the prison populations have been empirically tested in various studies. The aim of the present study was to examine the factors associated with the symptoms of depression and anxiety in a sample of 179 Turkish male prisoners. For this purpose, a model conceptualized by Schaefer and Moos (
1998
) was used as the theoretical framework for this study. The role of locus of control (as a personality trait); prison type, crime type, time spent in prison (as situational and crime-related variables); and the effect of prison-life stress on the prisoners' level of depression and anxiety symptoms were tested by using two separate structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses. Results revealed that by playing a mediator role, prison-life stress affected locus of control and situational and crime-related variables and hence, indirectly influenced depression and anxiety symptoms. Examining the role of the situational and personality factors on prisoners will provide a new departure for further studies conducted within prison settings.

N2  - In recent years, there has been a shift in academic and public discourses surrounding the abolition of police. While academics have heavily drawn from prison abolition frameworks to discuss the radical possibilities of materializing a world without law enforcement, police abolition in itself has been heavily undertheorized. Moreover, contemporary dominant paradigms on police/prison abolition have primarily drawn from the scholarship of people of the African diaspora. Without minimizing the plight and contributions of Black folks and scholar-activists, these existing frameworks have not addressed the nuances of how state-sanctioned violence is deployed against Mexican origin/Indigenous/Chicana/o/x people who face police violence at alarming rates. Drawing from Chicana/o/x epistemologies and ontologies, we ask: how can critical carceral studies center Chicanx scholarship to outline a police abolition paradigm that is rooted in the liberation of all Third World Peoples? By centering an understanding of how technologies of carcerality and settler colonialism, as manifest by the police state (e.g., police brutality, homicides, terror, etc.), are violently enforced on Chicana/o/x communities, the authors introduce a culture-informed framework that advances the theoretical contributions of police/prison abolitionist studies and efforts.

N2  - The prevalence of individuals with or at risk for HIV infection in prisons and jails is severalfold higher than age-adjusted rates In surrounding communities. This HIV serosurvey of 975 newly sentenced male prisoners employed a new methodology that anonymously linked individual information to HIV serologic data. The HIV prevalence was 6.1%; multivariate regression analysis indicated injection drug use (OR = 18.9), black race (OR = 5.5), Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 3.4), psychiatric illness (OR = 3.1) and a history of having had a sexually transmitted disease(OR = 2.2) were independent predictors of HIV infection. Laboratory markers such as hypoalbuminemia, an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia suggest increased risk for HIV among prisoners, particularly in settings where HIV testing resources are scarce. This study, unlike those reported in other geographic regions, indicated that the majority (71%) of HIV-seropositive persons self-reported their HIV status. This finding may suggest that HIV-infected individuals will self-report their status if HIV care is comprehensive and consistent. The large number of HIV-infected individuals within prisons makes prisons important sites for the introduction of comprehensive HIV-related care. This is particularly relevant in that development of new guidelines issued for the management of HIV infection in which potent combination antiretroviral therapy has been demonstrated to decrease morbidity and mortality. The high prevalence of HIV-seronegative inmates with self-reported high-risk behaviors also suggests the importance of prisons as sites for the introduction of appropriate risk-reduction interventions.

N2  - Objective:
Self-injurious behaviours (SIBs) are widespread among prisoners and are sometimes classified as potentially calculated acts intended to control others. Access to a psychiatrist may be valued by imprisoned soldiers seeking immediate release from service. The main goal of the study was to assess the effects of a new mental health regulation in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) prison system, which requires ordering an immediate interview with a psychiatrist for inmates performing SIBs.
Method:
Frequency of SIBs in 2 military prisons was examined and compared for 11 months before and 10 months after the implementation of the regulation. Severity of injuries and rates of release from service were examined for 4 months.
Results:
The frequency of SIBs significantly increased after the implementation of the regulation in one prison, but not in the other. No effect was found for rate of release from service or for severity of injuries.
Conclusions:
Increased accessibility to a psychiatrist for military prisoners may have resulted in increased motivation for inmates to perform SIBs. These effects are limited to the prison that serves a higher proportion of highly stressed soldiers.

N2  - High-level penicillin resistance has been associated with treatment failure in patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. To identify a subgroup of patients at low risk for high-level penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae bacteremia, a cross-sectional study of 303 patients was performed. For the total study population, penicillin resistance was observed in 98 (32%) of 303 patients; high-level resistance was seen in 33 (11%). A predictive model was created by using 3 baseline variables that were independently associated with high-level penicillin resistance: previous β-lactam antibiotic use, previous stay in a risk area (defined as stay in day care facilities, prisons, homeless shelters, nursing homes, or other long-term care facilities), and previous respiratory tract infection. The model was used to identify patients at low and high risk for high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococcal bacteremia. None of the isolates of patients in the low-risk subgroup had ceftriaxone resistance. Patients in the low-risk subgroup could be empirically treated with fluoroquinolone-sparing regimens.

N2  - Background:  Cross‐national studies describing the psychopathological characteristics of arrested adolescents are virtually non‐existent. Such studies are important because they have implications for national policy on arrest, case‐management, and future research.
Method:  To address this issue, self‐report surveys administered to representative groups of 12‐ to 16‐year‐old adolescents in New Haven, USA (N = 1138) and Antwerp, Belgium (N = 627) were compared. A number of internalizing and deviant behavior variables were compared between controls (C), non‐arrested antisocial (NA), and arrested antisocial (AR) participants.
Results:  Similar cross‐national arrest rates and levels of antisocial behavior were found. NA and AR youths in both countries reported more internalizing problems, except for anxiety, and more deviant characteristics. Contrary to expectations, the level of depression was not higher in AR compared to NA youth when differences in antisocial behavior between NA and AR were controlled. Also unexpected, arrest showed an independent association with a number of deviant behavior variables.
Conclusions:  Further research should investigate the underlying mechanisms of these associations, as this insight would be useful for developing future intervention and prevention programs, as well as for developing future national policies regarding juvenile antisocial behavior.

N2  - We sought to determine the prevalence and correlates of self-reported HIV testing among inmates in correctional centers in Ontario, Canada. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a stratified random sample of 597 male and female adult inmates. The participation rate was 89%. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression were used to analyze HIV testing. Fifty-eight percent had ever been tested, and 21% had voluntarily tested while incarcerated in the past year. Having ever been tested was more common among those at risk for HIV through injection drug use (IDU) or sexual behavior. Testing while incarcerated in the past year was independently associated with being single (OR = 2.6), frequent IDU (OR = 4.0), not having casual sex partners prior to incarceration (OR = 0.53), a history of hepatitis (OR = 2.4), previous HIV testing (OR = 3.7), a close relationship with an HIV-positive person in the outside community (OR = 1.7), knowing an HIV-positive person inside (OR = 2.7), a perceived chance of being infected during incarceration (OR = 2.2), and support of mandatory testing (OR = 2.0). The predominant motivations for testing while incarcerated were IDU or fears of infection inside, possibly through contact with blood, during fights, or even by casual contact. Voluntary HIV testing in prison should be encouraged, and inmates should receive appropriate counseling and information to allow realistic assessment of risk.

N2  - The aims of this study were to determine the social and demographic context, prevalence of mental disorder, and psychiatric treatment needs of women in prison mother and baby units in England. We conducted a survey of 55 mothers in the four prison mother and baby units in England, using semi-structured interviews, data from inmate medical records, and general practice records. More than half of the women were married or co-habiting and the vast majority had been living in their own homes prior to arrest. Many were from ethnic minorities and serving sentences for drug offences. In all, 60% had one or more of the five specific forms of mental disorder and a third were depressed. According to their inmate medical records, few were identified as having mental problems and only three were receiving any kind of treatment. Women in prison mother and baby units have particular characteristics that distinguish them from the rest of the female prison population. Admission criteria appear to select out women with psychiatric morbidity, child care problems, and other difficulties that may make them unsuitable for a mother and baby unit. The inmate medical records are a poor and unreliable source of mental health information and GP records provided no further information than the women themselves. Without treatment depression will impact on the mothers' ability to function effectively and it may have an adverse effect on the children's development.

N2  - Maladaptive social behavior is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathic personality disorder. Nevertheless, maladaptive social behavior has only rarely been observed among psychopaths in experimentally controlled situations. The authors assessed the behavior of criminal psychopaths from high-security psychiatric hospitals in a computer simulation of a social dilemma situation. The psychopaths showed a markedly higher proneness to competitive (i.e., noncooperative) behavior than did healthy adults from the general population. The odds ratio between defection and being a psychopath was estimated at 7.86 in the sample. The probability to choose selfish instead of cooperative behavior was significantly linked to the following subscales of the Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised (
S. O. Lilienfeld & M. R. Widows, 2005
): rebellious nonconformity, Machiavellian egocentricity, and the total score. On average, the psychopathic participants accumulated higher gain and more strongly exploited their counterpart than did the healthy participants.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. A major proposal for appropriately treating persons with mental illnesses who have been arrested is to divert them from jail to community-based mental health programs. However, there are few available definitions, guidelines, and principles for developing effective diversion programs. The goal of this research was to determine the number and kinds of jail diversion programs that exist, how they are set up, and which types of programs are effective. METHODS. On the basis of information gathered during a national mail survey (n = 1263) and follow-up telephone survey of 115 responding jails, 18 sites were selected for on-site interviews based on perceived effectiveness and presence of a formal diversion program. RESULTS. Data are presented from a national sample of jail diversion programs (n = 18). Key factors for developing diversion programs and descriptors of effective programs are presented. CONCLUSIONS. It is clear that controlled, longitudinal studies of these programs' effectiveness, using client-based and organizational outcome measures, are badly needed.

N2  - Current research concludes that participation in postprison aftercare is critical to the effectiveness of prison-based therapeutic community (TC) treatment. This conclusion makes it imperative to understand the client determinants of retention in prison treatment, particularly continuance in postprison aftercare. Currently, however, little data exist as to client predictors of seeking and remaining in prison-based TCs or entering postrelease aftercare. In the present study, significant relationships were obtained between initial motivation (i.e., Circumstances, Motivation, Readiness [CMR] scores), retention, aftercare, and outcomes in a sample of substance abusers treated in a prison-based TC program. Implications are discussed for theory, research, and treatment policy.

N2  - Objective: To determine HIV prevalence among male prison inmates in the six OECS countries in the Caribbean.
Subjects and Methods: Six unlinked, anonymous point prevalence surveys of a total of 1288 male inmates were conducted during a one-year period, August 2004-August 2005. An. oral fluid sample was collected and an interviewer-administered questionnaire and consent form was completed for each survey participant.
Results: The overall HIV prevalence was 2.8% (range 2.0 - 4.1%). Only 39% of all inmates had previously been tested, compared to 67% of the HIV-positive inmates. Of all inmates who previously tested, 61% had their last test less than two years ago, 45% had done so while in prison and 39% had done so in a hospital. Most of those who had not previously been tested had no particular reason for not doing so (57%); 24% of them felt it was not necessary or they were not at risk.
Conclusion: HIV prevalence among male prison inmates was three times higher than the estimated OECS population prevalence in 2003, slightly higher than the prevalence among incarcerated males in the United States of America and Canada, and lower than that in other Caribbean countries in earlier years. Health information on prison populations is important as this is a vulnerable group, with frequent movement in and out of the general population. Preventative services, voluntary counselling and testing, and appropriate care and treatment should be available to all inmates as this is an opportunity for many who may not otherwise access these services.

N2  - The nutritional adequacy of diets provided by a prison was assessed by analysis of the kitchen menu for 1 week of a 4-week cycle. Dietary intakes were determined using a predefined 7-day diet diary in which prisoners indicated what they had eaten, and how much. A total of 159 prisoners took part in the study. The food provided by the prison kitchen was broadly in line with current dietary recommendations. Vitamin content exceeded recommendations, with the exception of niacin in the vegetarian menu (12.6 mg compared with the reference nutrient intake of 16.8 mg). Selenium content was low in all menus, but particularly in the vegetarian menu in 1997 where it equalled the lower reference nutrient intake (LRNI) (39.5 μg). Food choices made by prisoners resulted in a wide variation in dietary intakes. Fat intake (as a proportion of energy) exceeded the recommended 35% in 82% of diets in 1996, and 64% of diets in 1997. In 1996, 34% of prisoners had intakes above 40% energy as fat. High fat intakes were largely the result of consuming items from the prison shop. Vitamin D intakes were low (3.4 and 3.3 μg in 1996 and 1997, respectively) compared with the recommendation (10 μg) for those with limited exposure to sunlight. Intakes of a number of minerals fell below recommendations, with some prisoners barely meeting the LRNI. This was particularly notable for selenium where 35% of prisoners in 1996, and 60% of prisoners in 1997 had intakes below the LRNI.

N2  - Background: There is an increasing reliance on noninvasive techniques to collect specimens for the detection of sexually transmitted infections. The acceptability of these methods among the general population has been explored, but little is known about their acceptability among women confined in prison. Goal: The goal was to compare female prisoners' preferences for collection of specimens (self-collected vaginal swab specimens, urine collection, or pelvic examination) for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Study Design: A cross-section of inmates in a large federal prison provided urine samples and self-collected vaginal swab specimens. Women then completed a questionnaire regarding the ease of each method and their preferences for future specimen collection. Results: A total of 535 women between the ages of 18 and 52 years (median = 33) participated in the study. More than half of the participants (57%) reported no difference between urine and swab in terms of ease of collection. Approximately 30% of participants said they would prefer to give a swab specimen in the future rather than collect urine (21%), but nearly half of the women expressed no preference for one method over the other. Most participants (60%) expressed a preference for providing a self-collected swab specimen rather than having a pelvic examination (23%), but nearly 17% expressed a preference for one over the other. Conclusion: The study population of female federal prisoners expressed no aversion to the self-collection of either vaginal swab or urine specimens for STD testing. A majority of participants expressed a preference for noninvasive techniques rather than a pelvic examination.

N2  - Individuals with substance abuse and mental health problems are common in prisons and jails, but relatively little is known about the health or health services utilization of inmates with these types of problems. This study, therefore, focuses on prisoners who self-reported receiving a prior diagnosis from a physician or a psychologist who indicated they had 1) substance abuse problems only, 2) mental health problems only, and 3) substance abuse and mental health problems. A fourth group of prisoners who reported no diagnoses were included as the "no problems" group. Comparisons were made on reports of lifetime health problems, use of preventive health services, and use of medical services. Findings showed the substance abuse and mental health problems group had the most serious health problems profiles. Use of preventive health services was similar across all four groups, but the substance abuse and mental health problems group reported significantly greater use of the emergency room and more hospital stays both for their lifetime and in the year prior to their current incarceration. The policy and practical relevance of the findings are discussed.

N2  - Little is known about the effectiveness of treatments for severe personality disorder in prisons. Any treatment within the prison context will aim to reduce criminogenic risk in its participants, and ameliorate the overall symptomatology of the disorder. The over-representation of borderline personality disorder in female prisons has lead to pilots of dialectical behaviour therapy in three such establishments in the UK. This treatment was designed for borderline personality disordered women in the community in the USA, and this is the first time it has been piloted within a UK prison context. It was the treatment of choice as it had the strongest evidence base in lower security settings. Overall findings from the pilots have been very promising in terms of the viability of DBT as an offending behaviour programme and in terms of improving the manageability of prisoners on the wing. The case studies described here aim to illustrate in some detail the cognitive and behavioural change process in individuals over a year of treatment, and at six-month follow-up, and to highlight the particular challenges faced by participants and therapists when delivering treatment in prison. In describing the improvements in all three cases, which vary in terms of symptomatology and background, we aim to demonstrate the versatility of DBT in the prison setting and its capacity for reducing criminogenic risk.

N2  - Urban political study has experienced several critical junctures. Rather than following an incremental path of cumulative development, urban analysis has gone through phases of reframing akin to what Thomas Kuhn called paradigm shifts. The purpose of this article is threefold: (1) to examine paradigmatic frameworks as alterations in urban inquiry, (2) to address the issue of why such shifts come about, and (3) to remind readers that shifts are double-edged, not only bringing new perspective to inquiry but also risking that other significant considerations may be overlooked in the process. Urban paradigms compete for preeminence, and all are in need of ongoing critical reassessment. The hold of any given framework of analysis proves impermanent in part because the underlying urban situation it illuminates is never static. The risk of a lag in analysis is never low.

N2  - Objective: To determine the utility of postmortem CT (PMCT) examination in establishing the cause of death among male prisoners dying in Karachi jails.
Methods: A descriptive study was carried out from February 2006 to September 2007, CT Scan section, Civil Hospital Karachi and the Mortuary, Dow Medical College, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi. Adult male prisoners dying in the Karachi central prison and referred to the study setting for determining the cause of death for medico legal purpose were included. Female prisoners and those cases where the final report of cause of death was not available were excluded. CT scan of the vital body regions (head, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis) was carried out in all cases. The scan was read and reported by two radiologists. Anatomical dissection based autopsy was carried out by the forensic expert. Final report regarding the cause of death was issued by the forensic expert based on the combined findings, histopathology, toxicology results and circumstantial evidence. The CT scan and autopsy findings were compared and percentage agreement was determined using kappa statistics.
Results: There were 14 cases in all with mean age of 41.2 +/- 17 years. The alleged mode of death was custodial torture in all cases. CT scan determined the cause of death to be natural cardio-respiratory failure in 10, strangulation in 01, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in 02 and trauma to spine in 01 case. The autopsy determined natural death in 11 and pulmonary TB in 02 and asphyxia in 01. The percentage agreement between CT and autopsy was 92% (k=0.92) and between CT and finalized cause of death was 100% (k=1.0).
Conclusion: PMCT is as effective as dissection autopsy in identifying pulmonary infections and natural causes of death. It is more effective in identifying vertebral fractures which may exclude hanging and corroborate trauma to spine (JPMA 60:4; 2010).

N2  - An interview study was conducted among a group of incoming prisoners in a county jail in Ohio during the summers of 1997 and 1998 to assess their current drug treatment needs. "Incoming prisoners" refers to individuals who were being transferred from this county jail to the state prison system. Marijuana and cocaine were the most commonly tried illegal drugs among the subjects as well as the drugs of choice during the month prior to imprisonment. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule, combined with questions employed in the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) project, was used to construct the questionnaire for this study. Based on the criteria of DSM-IV diagnoses, 57.5% of those interviewed had exhibited drug dependency at some point in their lives, and 51% were currently dependent on some substance. Thus, more than half of the incoming prisoners were in need of treatment for use of at least one substance. Cocaine dependence was the greatest problem facing this group of inmates, with an especially notable problem among the older females. Younger males were more likely to have current marijuana dependence. The study found that individuals currently dependent on cocaine or opiates perceived that they had a need for drug treatment, while those currently dependent on marijuana did not share this perception.

N2  - We sought to examine the impact of political imprisonment on anxiety depression, and somatic symptoms reported by newly arrived Tibetan refugees in Dharamsala, India. We used the Hopkins Symptom Checklist‐25 to compare 76 previously imprisoned with 74 never imprisoned recent Tibetan refugees. Previously imprisoned refugees reported more traumatic events, especially torture and deprivation. Previously imprisoned refugees reported more anxiety than nonimprisoned refugees, but the groups were similarly high in terms of depression and number ot somatic complaints. According to assessment with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, 20% of the tortured and imprisoned refugees met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder.

N2  - Objective: The effectiveness of federal prison-based residential drug and alcohol treatment programs was evaluated using event history procedures that addressed the problem of selection bias and included a wide range of control variables. Methods: The sample comprised 760 treatment subjects and 809 comparison subjects. Treatment subjects were from 20 different prisons of medium, low, and minimum security levels. Comparison subjects were drawn from over 30 prisons. Results: The results indicated that individuals who entered and completed in-prison residential treatment were less likely to experience the critical postrelease outcomes of new arrests and substance use during the first 6 months following release. Conclusions: Without controlling for selection bias, the effects of treatment would most likely have been attenuated. The results have greater generalizability than other studies of prison-based treatment. This study occurred within a multisite context of 20 programs serving both male and female inmates and operating within different security levels and different geographic regions.

N2  - Background: People remanded into custody by the courts have a substantially higher rate of severe mental disorder than other prisoners and the general population. Knowledge of their prevalence, needs and characteristics and an analysis of pathways to care may be necessary to provide mental health care effectively and efficiently. Previous prison studies focusing on psychotic offenders have suffered from the use of instruments not validated in a forensic setting and lack of a relevant comparison group.
Method: The Diagnostic Interview for Psychosis (DP) is a composite semi-structured standardized interview schedule. It combines social and demographic descriptors with measures of functioning adapted from the World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS). The remand centre surveyed had 466 cells and is the main remand and reception centre for males for the southern region of the state of Queensland, Australia. Of the 621 men screened, 65 answered yes to at least one question in the DP and were interviewed.
Results: Six hundred and twenty-one remandees were screened and of these 61 were interviewed as screened positive for psychotic disorder. Thirty-five per cent had been homeless for an average of 32 weeks during the previous year. Most had had little contact with families or close friends. Eighty-one per cent were receiving no treatment at the time of offence. Seventy-eight per cent were unemployed and in receipt of a pension. Eighty per cent were dependent on alcohol, cannabis or amphetamines. Statistical issues of power are detailed in the text.
Conclusions: The simplistic ‘prison, hospital or community treatment’ debate is misleading. Instead, the development of flexible preventative, management and accommodation services for people with severe mental disorder who have committed offences is a priority.

N2  - Although the largest effects of prison-based therapeutic community (TC) programs are associated with entry into aftercare, only a minority of prisoners volunteer for these aftercare programs. The study addresses the gap in our knowledge concerning these low rates of voluntary entry. A theoretical formulation of the TC process involving the effect of the interaction of clients' motivation and participation in the activities of the TC on entry into aftercare was tested on a sample of 110 volunteers in a prison-based TC for whom there were client and staff ratings of 3-month participation and 12-month follow-up data on relapse and recidivism. Path analyses support a model in which the interaction of motivation and 3-month participation ratings have a direct effect on the selection of aftercare, and aftercare has a direct effect on relapse and recidivism. The use of a combination of enhanced motivation and early program participation as a means of increasing the utilization and effectiveness of aftercare is discussed.

N2  - Objective:  The authors' goal was to determine the prevalence of affective disorder, a history of traumatic events and the prevalence of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis in their relationship to ‘psychopathy’ in a sample of younger male delinquents admitted to a correctional institution.
Method:  As part of routine mental health screening, the SCID‐1 and Psychopathy Checklist (PCL‐R) were administered to 102 inmates aged 17–27 years.
Results:  Affective disorder was found in 28% and 29% had a history of suicidal attempts. The PCL‐R‐score was significantly correlated with the number of prior threatening events, but PTSD could not be diagnosed in the ‘psychopathic’ group. The prevalence of affective disorder was significantly higher in the ‘non‐psychopathic’ group.
Conclusion:  The inverse relationship between threatening events and the PTSD diagnosis seems to indicate other coping modalities than those found in ‘non‐psychopaths’. That finding is discussed against the background of psychophysiological data and psychosocial learning models.

N2  - If one stands only a step back from the periodic changing of the political guard, perhaps the most impressive social trend in post-1960s America has been the rise of what academic critics have called the “carceral state.”¹ In plain English the carceral state is a type of political organization in which three conditions obtain. First, incarceration becomes the preferred sanction for a growing number of infractions. Second, official bureaucracies and civil society collude to intensify enforcement, enhance penalties, and keep the prison system growing. Third, a bloated prison system begins to supply norms for other institutions of government: surveillance becomes

N2  - The juvenile justice system relies heavily on residential treatment services for adolescents. Because treatment dropout limits the likely effectiveness of these services, in this study we examine the client and program characteristics associated with program retention among a sample of adolescent probationers referred to residential rehabilitation by the Juvenile Court in Los Angeles. Participants in the present study (n=291) are a subset of those in the Adolescent Outcomes Project, conducted within RAND's Drug Policy Research Center, to examine the outcomes of youths entering treatment at seven residential treatment programs. Three months after a preadmission interview, youths were asked about their perceptions of counselors at the program, other residents, and their feelings of safety in the program. In addition, they were asked whether they needed and had received various services (e.g., job training, legal advice, family counseling). Results of a multivariate survival analysis revealed that pretreatment characteristics including motivation and substance use severity, as well as treatment program factors including safety, and perceived over- and underprovision of services, contribute significantly to the prediction of retention. Pretreatment environmental risk factors and ratings of program counselor and resident support were marginally significant. These results imply that changes in adolescent residential program delivery may serve to increase retention rates, thus improving long-term outcomes.

N2  - The definition of the age of young offenders was changed by an Act of Parliament (The Crime and Disorder Act 1998), which was implemented by the Home Office on 1 April 2000. This Act brought down the upper-age limit of young offenders from 20 to 17. Our objective was to investigate the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among this redefined group of young offenders. Among various types of STIs, we observed that a significant number of young prisoners had complaints of testicular lumps (35%), which were not reported in the past. We tried to find out the reason for this common complaint and believe that this was due to extra vigilance, and testicular self-examination in conjunction with sex and relationship programmes which ran alongside other programmes developed as a joint venture by Prisoner Learning and Skills Unit, Prison Health Policy Unit and Sex Education Forum.

N2  - This thesis draws on the insights of rape myth scholarship and also critical responses to battered women who kill to argue that trial outcomes in child death cases may have been influenced by mothering myths. It argues that in order to understand the reasons for wrongful convictions in such cases, we must look beyond the issue of flawed expert evidence, namely to possibly stereotypical interpretations of maternal behaviours around the time the children died. Notwithstanding the difficulties in reading across from rape trials to child death cases, and that both rape myth acceptance research and the carceral approach have been challenged, Gerger et al’s definition of a rape myth is adapted here to theorise a mothering myth. Child death cases are interrogated to identify evidence admitted of maternal behaviours, and using the theorisation of a mothering myth, this thesis suggests that if fixed beliefs were used to interpret maternal behaviours, biased inferences may have been made. Little evidence of the probative value of such material has been identified. This thesis therefore examines why evidence of maternal behaviour was admitted and whether mothering myths may have informed aspects of child death cases including admissibility, the absence of judicial directions and jury deliberations. Options to limit the extent to which juries in future child death cases can rely on mothering myths are considered, and proposals for new judicial directions are made. A roadmap of empirical research is proposed to test the suggested analogies between rape myths and mothering myths, drawing on the methodological insights of rape myth work.

N2  - The study examined the 30-day and lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV alcohol and drug disorders among state prison inmates. A sample of 400 inmates consecutively admitted to a state prison reception center were assessed for alcohol and drug disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV). Test-retest reliabilities were calculated for the SCID-IV. Lifetime substance abuse or dependence disorders were detected among 74% of inmates, including over half who were dependent on alcohol or drugs. for the 30 days prior to incarceration, over half of the sample were diagnosed as having substance abuse or dependence disorders, including 46% who were dependent on alcohol or drugs. Black inmates were significantly less likely to be diagnosed as alcohol dependent than whites or Hispanics. the high rates of substance use disorders are consistent with previous findings from other studies conducted in correctional settings and reflect the need to expand treatment capacity in prisons.

N2  - Aim: To estimate psychiatric and somatic morbidity in a nation-wide prison population, as inferred from detailed medication sheets. Method: Medication sheets from 37 prisons, covering 90% of the Norwegian prison population, were collected and examined by experienced clinicians. All inmates on medication were assigned best-estimate psychiatric and/or somatic diagnoses according to the International Classification of Primary Care diagnostic system. Results: Among the 2617 inmates 919 (35%) had psychiatric disorders, as estimated by our methodology. Depressive disorders (11%) and sleep disorders (11%) were most prevalent. Twenty-six inmates (1%) were prescribed medication indicative of affective psychosis and an additional 77 (3%) received anti-psychotic drugs in doses indicating other psychotic disorders, bringing the sum total of psychosis up to 103 (4%). A total of 848 inmates (32%) were estimated to suffer from somatic disorders. Various pain conditions were prevalent (11%) in addition to obstructive airway diseases and asthma (4%). Both psychiatric and somatic disorders were more prevalent in female prisoners. Conclusion: This study has demonstrated high psychiatric and somatic morbidity in a nation-wide population of prison inmates receiving adequate health services. As the morbidity estimates are inferred from prescription drug use they must be interpreted with caution. However, we do believe that our study, utilizing this unconventional but readily available source of information, has yielded valuable knowledge regarding the physical and mental health of a nation-wide prison population.

N2  - Clients who received crisis services at a homeless shelter for transition-aged youth were recruited for a study to describe the youth served, to track outcomes of care, and to examine factors associated with differing outcomes. Participants were 202 men and women who completed a battery of interviews and self-report measures at intake and at 3 follow-up points. Youth served had experienced high levels of adversity and trauma and typically had poor educational and vocational preparation. A multidisciplinary array of services was provided, and overall, participants showed significant improvement from intake to discharge and in the 6 months after discharge. Background, service, and psychological factors did not predict housing outcomes. Better vocational outcome was associated with more recent work experience. Results point to the need for providers of services to the homeless to be aware of the distinct needs and characteristics of transition-aged youth.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Many jail inmates have severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, major affective disorders). The courts have mandated that detainees have a constitutional right to treatment. We investigated what proportion of female jail detainees needed mental health services, what proportion received services, and what variables predicted who received services. METHODS: Trained interviewers administered a psychiatric evaluation (the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule) to 1272 randomly selected female jail detainees during jail intake in a large Midwestern city. Project staff then documented whether women subsequently received services, using records and case files. RESULTS: Of the women who needed services, 23.5% received them while they were in jail. Type of disorder, treatment history, and socio-demographic variables all affected the odds of a mentally ill woman's receiving services. CONCLUSIONS: Correctional health care is a growing national public health problem. The magnitude of mental health service needs far exceeds current resources.

N2  - Background: Results of previous studies suggest that many female offenders have co-morbid psychiatric disorders, which require mental health services. However, few longitudinal studies examined subjects during incarceration or detention. This study compares depressive symptoms, abnormal eating behaviour and impulsivity before release from a detention centre and after incarceration, thereby indicating the effectiveness of psychiatric intervention in a Japanese detention centre.
Method: Of 64 young women, 36 were followed up. Self-report measures were used to assess depression, eating behaviour and impulsivity after incarceration and one month before release.
Results: Of the 36 participants, nine were diagnosed using the MINI-kids as needing mental health services. Those who received psychiatric intervention were diagnosed as having major depression and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. Significant main effects of intervention and effects of time were shown in the DSD. The EAT-26 score demonstrated the significance of the effects of time and interaction. In the BIS-11 scores, neither intervention nor time showed significant effects.
Conclusions: Results of this study showed that the time course and psychiatric intervention contributed to recovery of depression and therapeutic intervention. The time course might reduce eating problems. Psychiatric intervention might be necessary for female juvenile detainees, which presents an important issue for future studies.

N2  - BACKGROUND Given the growth of juvenile detainee populations, epidemiologic data on their psychiatric disorders are increasingly important. Yet, there are few empirical studies. Until we have better epidemiologic data, we cannot know how best to use the system's scarce mental health resources. METHODS Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children version 2.3, interviewers assessed a randomly selected, stratified sample of 1829 African American, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic youth (1172 males, 657 females, ages 10-18 years) who were arrested and detained in Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs). We present 6-month prevalence estimates by demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age) for the following disorders: affective disorders (major depressive episode, dysthymia, manic episode), anxiety (panic, separation anxiety, overanxious, generalized anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders), psychosis, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol and other drugs). RESULTS Nearly two thirds of males and nearly three quarters of females met diagnostic criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders. Excluding conduct disorder (common among detained youth), nearly 60% of males and more than two thirds of females met diagnostic criteria and had diagnosis-specific impairment for one or more psychiatric disorders. Half of males and almost half of females had a substance use disorder, and more than 40% of males and females met criteria for disruptive behavior disorders. Affective disorders were also prevalent, especially among females; more than 20% of females met criteria for a major depressive episode. Rates of many disorders were higher among females, non-Hispanic whites, and older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest substantial psychiatric morbidity among juvenile detainees. Youth with psychiatric disorders pose a challenge for the juvenile justice system and, after their release, for the larger mental health system.Arch Gen Psychiatry .2002;59:1133-1143-->

N2  - Background: Clinicians working in a women's prison in British Columbia observed hepatitis C sero-conversion among inmates, prompting this study to determine: the characteristics of women who do and do not report illicit drug use in prison; patterns of drug use inside prison; factors associated with illicit drug use that might contribute to bloodborne transmission inside prison. Methods: A cross-sectional observational data set was created using an anonymous 61-item self-administered survey. Results: Eighty-three percent (104/126) of eligible inmates participated. Seventy-four percent (77/104) reported their current prison sentence was related to illicit drug use and 25% (26/104) reported their ethnicity as Aboriginal. Ninety-three percent (97/104) reported a prior history of illicit drug use, of whom 70% (68/97) reported a history of injection drug use. Thirty-six percent (37/104) reported illicit drug use in prison, and 21% (22/104) reported injection drug use in prison. Fifty-two percent (54/104) reported hepatitis C sero-positivity, and 8% (8/104) reported HIV sero-positivity. Of the 22 women who reported prison injection drug use, 91% (20/22) reported hepatitis C infection and 86% (19/22) reported injecting with shared needles inside prison, with or without bleach cleaning. Women were more likely to report illicit drug use in prison if they had had illegal sources of income prior to incarceration (p=0.0081, OR 3.19), had previously injected drugs (p=0.036, OR 2.97), and had first injected drugs at a friend's house (p=0.066, OR 2.70). Interpretation: The majority of women reporting prison injection drug use also reported hepatitis C sero-positivity and shared needle use. Canadian prisons are risk situations for transmission of bloodborne pathogens, and provide opportunities for harm reduction strategies. Contexte : Le personnel clinique d'une prison pour femmes en Colombie-Britannique a observé une séroconversion par le virus de l'hépatite C chez les détenues, ce qui nous a amenés à déterminer, dans le cadre de notre étude, les caractéristiques des femmes qui déclarent ou non avoir consommé des drogues illicites en prison, les tendances de la consommation de drogues en prison, ainsi que les facteurs associés à la consommation de drogues illicites qui pourraient contribuer à la transmission d'infections véhiculées par le sang en prison. Méthode : Nous avons créé un ensemble de données d'observation transversales d'après les réponses obtenues à un questionnaire anonyme de 61 questions, que les détenues ont rempli par elles-mêmes. Résultats : Quatre-vingt-trois p. cent (104/126) des détenues admissibles ont participé à l'étude. Soixante-quatorze p. cent (77/104) ont déclaré que leur peine d'emprisonnement actuelle était liée à la consommation de drogues illicites, et 25 % (26/104) ont dit être d'appartenance ethnique autochtone. Quatre-vingt-treize p. cent (97/104) ont fait état d'antécédents de consommation de drogues illicites; de ce chiffre, 70 % (68/97) ont déclaré avoir fait usage de drogues injectables. Trente-six p. cent (37/104) ont déclaré avoir consommé des drogues illicites en prison, et 21 % (22/104), avoir fait usage de drogues injectables en prison. Cinquante-deux p. cent (54/104) ont dit être séropositives pour le VHC, et 8 % (8/104) ont dit être séropositives pour le VIH. Sur les 22 femmes qui s'étaient injecté des drogues en prison, 91 % (20/22) ont dit être infectées par l'hépatite C, et 86 % (19/22) avaient partagé des aiguilles en prison (nettoyées ou non à l'eau de javel au préalable). Les détenues étaient plus susceptibles de déclarer avoir consommé des drogues illicites en prison si elles avaient gagné des revenus de sources illicites avant leur incarcération (p = 0,0081, RC = 3,19), si elles s'étaient déjà injecté des drogues (p = 0,036, RC = 2,97) et si elles s'étaient déjà injecté des drogues au domicile d'un ami ou d'une amie (p = 0,066, RC = 2,70). Interprétation : La majorité des femmes qui disent avoir fait usage de drogues injectables en prison déclarent aussi être séropositives pour le VHC et avoir partagé des aiguilles. Les prisons canadiennes présentent des risques de transmission des agents pathogènes véhiculés par le sang, et il devrait être possible d'y implanter des stratégies de réduction des méfaits.

N2  - This study investigated the relationship between attachment styles, interpersonal problem areas, and violent behaviour in German offenders compared with two non-violent comparison groups living in the community. To measure attachment, a semi-structured interview designed to identify and classify prototypes of attachment was applied. Interpersonal problems were assessed with a self-report measure. Offenders showed less secure attachment styles, more instability in relationships, less emotional attachment to others, and a strong wish for personal autonomy, but most interpersonal problem areas did not differ across the groups. Violent offenders are by no means all insecurely attached. Their results match with those of any socially disadvantaged, non-clinical group. The implications of these findings are discussed.

N2  - AbstractThe business strategies of brand differentiation, narrowcasting, vertical integration, digital distribution, and audience surveillance which made the post-network era's creative revolution commercially viable have also helped to drive the progressive fragmentation of the public sphere, undermining television's role as communal cultural forum and exacerbating trends such as political polarization. In this conclusion, I ruminate on the cultural, social, and political implications of a media landscape which is simultaneously subject to increasing corporate consolidation on the one hand and oversaturated with content, channels, and platforms on the other. Can our increasingly hysterical attention economy cultivate the communal structures of democratic deliberation necessary to end mass incarceration? Or will we find ourselves subtly yet increasingly captivated by a hyperactive media ecology which is itself curiously carceral?Keywords: American media studies, political economy of streaming TV, digital public sphere, prison reform, narrowcasting and microtargeting, political polarizationIn his influential study Inside Prime Time, Todd Gitlin follows a paragraph on the then nascent industry strategy of narrowcasting with a prediction which has not quite stood the test of time: “the brave new cornucopia is likely to create only minor, marginal chances for a diversity of substance – and fewer and fewer as time goes on” (332). Today, an unprecedented number of TV shows self-proclaim their “quality” aspirations even as an increasing array of channels and platforms cater to the tastes of evermore finely grained audience segments. Narrowcasting, media convergence, and multichannel proliferation have fostered an explosion of televisual diversity even as they have at the same time increasingly fragmented audiences, unsettling TV's prior roles as both consensus medium and communal cultural forum. However, Gitlin's book seems to have been prescient in other ways; even though a greater number of programs are now produced for a wider range of niche audiences across a multitude of channels and platforms than ever before, “Conglomeration proceeds apace. Homogeneity at the cultural center is complemented by consumer fragmentation on the margins. Technology opens doors, and oligopoly marches in just behind, slamming them. There can be no technological fix for what is, after all, a social problem” (Gitlin 332).

N2  - This study explores recent temporal trends in HIV prevalence among women entering prison and the incidence and associated risk factors among women reincarcerated in Rhode Island. Results from mandatory HIV testing from 1992 to 1996 for all incarcerated women were examined. In addition, a case control study was conducted on all seroconverters from 1989 to 1997. In all, 5836 HIV tests were performed on incarceration in 3146 women, 105 of whom tested positive (prevalence, 3.3%). Between 1992 and 1996, the annual prevalence of HIV among all women known to be HIV-positive was stable (p = .12). Age >25 years, nonwhite race, and prior incarceration were associated with seropositivity. Of 1081 initially seronegative women who were retested on reincarceration, 12 seroconverted during 1885 person-years (PY) of follow-up (incidence, 0.6/100 PY). Self-reported injection drug use (IDU; odds ratio [OR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-10.1) was significantly associated with seroconversion, but sexual risk was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-3.5). Incarceration serves as an opportunity for initiation of treatment and linkage to community services for a population that is at high risk for HIV infection.

N2  - The provision of mental health services in the correctional system is challenging at best for various clinical, administrative, and structural reasons. Among the complicating factors is the assessment and management of character pathology which either confounds the treatment of more "serious" mental illnesses, e.g. Axis I disorders, and/or presents itself as the primary focus for intervention. In this paper we review the prevalence of personality disorders on the prison mental health services caseload in New York State. We compare inpatient and outpatient rates among the various disorders documented in the prison system, as well as look at these rates within the context of the rates of personality disorder in the state mental health system generally. Assessment of personality disorder will be addressed with particular attention to the confounding influence of the prison environment. Finally, treatment options will be discussed, including discussion of new initiatives that attempt to address inmates with serious mental illness and personality traits that lead to disciplinary housing.

N2  - Fournier's gangrene is an aggressive, polymicrobial soft tissue infection that specifically affects the genital and perineal region. Treatment requires early recognition, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and radical surgical debridement of all infected tissues. Optimal therapy may necessitate multiple debridements that leave the patient with large tissue defects that require skin grafting for scrotal and perineal reconstruction. The presence of other surgical emergencies, such as an incarcerated inguinal hernia, in the face of Fournier's gangrene presents a rare and challenging dilemma to the general surgeon. With the widespread acceptance of tension-free repair utilizing prosthetic mesh in uncomplicated hernia surgery, outcomes have been improved. However, surgical options for hernia repair may become limited in the face of a regional necrotizing soft tissue infection, for which mesh use in an open repair after debridement of infected tissues is generally contraindicated. In this report, the authors describe three consecutive cases of incarcerated inguinal hernia in the presence of concomitant Fournier's gangrene using a laparoscopic approach and natural biomaterial mesh for abdominal wall reinforcement.

N2  - Objectives. This study was undertaken to assess a 28-day detention and treatment program’s effect, in a multiethnic county with high rates of alcohol-related arrests and crashes, on first-time offenders sentenced for driving while impaired (DWI).
Methods. We used comparison of baseline characteristics, survival curves of subsequent arrest, and Cox proportional hazards regression to examine probability of rearrest of those sentenced and those not sentenced to the program.
Results. Probability of not being rearrested was significantly higher for the treatment group after adjustment for covariates. At 5 years, probability of not being rearrested for the treatment vs the nontreatment group was 76.6% vs 59.9%.
Conclusions. Results suggest that this county’s program has significantly affected rearrest rates for Native Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Whites.

N2  - A fortnightly in-reach genitourinary (GU) medicine Service to a medium security male prison has been provided since April 2004. Patients are seen either by referrals from the prison general practitioner (GP), or at an individual's request. Problems have arisen due to a lack of space and time – the health adviser and doctor have to share a room. Since the prisoners have to leave Health Care by 1130 hours, if one inmate has complicated issues, it can result in these not being dealt with, or in patients not being seen as there is no flexibility. There has been an unexpectedly high DNA rate, which is multifactorial. Some prisoners have been moved to another prison since the request to be seen was made, some are on court attendances or have legal visits. Additionally some men choose not to come when sent for on the day. A few men who attend do so mistakenly, thinking that GUM is the dentist. This is particularly a problem where English is not the first language. The attendance of prisoners at the GU medicine service is noted in their prison health record, with relevant information, such as referral for management of hepatitis C. Of the 219 men seen in the first year, 55% had a GU medicine screen. The most common infections were chlamydia 10.5%, warts 12.1% and HCV 9%. The clinic has been well supported by patients and prison staff. High rates of infections are being detected and managed. The men have been happy to be screened, and despite initial concerns all are happy to provide urine specimens for chlamydia screening.

N2  - Abstract Objectives: (a) To determine both the frequency of injecting inside prison and use of sterilising tablets to clean needles in the previous four weeks; (b) to assess the efficiency of random mandatory drugs testing at detecting prisoners who inject heroin inside prison; (c) to determine the percentage of prisoners who had been offered vaccination against hepatitis B. Design: Cross sectional willing anonymous salivary HIV surveillance linked to a self completion risk factor questionnaire. Setting: Lowmoss prison, Glasgow, and Aberdeen prison on 11 and 30 October 1996. Subjects: 293 (94%) of all 312 inmates at Lowmoss and 146 (93%) of all 157 at Aberdeen, resulting in 286 and 143 valid questionnaires. Main outcome measures: Frequency of injecting inside prison in the previous four weeks by injector inmates who had been in prison for at least four weeks. Results: 116 (41%) Lowmoss and 53 (37%) Aberdeen prisoners had a history of injecting drug use but only 4% of inmates (17/395; 95% confidence interval 2% to 6%) had ever been offered vaccination against hepatitis B. 42 Lowmoss prisoners (estimated 207 injections and 258 uses of sterilising tablets) and 31 Aberdeen prisoners (229 injections, 221 uses) had injected inside prison in the previous four weeks. The prisons together held 112 injector inmates who had been in prison for more than four weeks, of whom 57 (51%; 42% to 60%) had injected in prison in the past four weeks; their estimated mean number of injections was 6.0 (SD 5.7). Prisoners injecting heroin six times in four weeks will test positive in random mandatory drugs testing on at most 18 days out of 28. Conclusions: Sterilising tablets and hepatitis B vaccination should be offered to all prisoners. Random mandatory drugs testing seriously underestimates injector inmates' harm reduction needs. Key messages Half of injector inmates of two Scottish prisons who had been in prison for more than four weeks had injected in the previous four weeks—an average of six times Injector inmates used sterilising tablets to clean injecting equipment as often as they injected Only 4% of inmates had ever been offered vaccination against hepatitis B Vaccination against hepatitis B and sterilising tablets are prisoners' rights Random mandatory drugs testing is likely to detect only one third to two thirds of heroin injectors in prison and so seriously underestimates injector inmates' drug reduction needs

N2  - Objective: This study sought to identify variables that independently correlate with age and substance use among a sample of 187 convicted felons in Georgia. Results: Results of regression analysis indicated that younger inmates were 2 times more likely than older inmates to report the occurrence of alcohol use (RR 2.07; 95% CI. 37, 11.6) and three times more likely than older inmates to report some history of marijuana use (RR 3.07; 95% CI 1.52, 6.11). In addition, younger inmates were half as likely or less to report using sedatives (RR. 53, 95% CI. 22, 1.29), tranquilizers (RR. 49, 95% CI. 22, 1.29), crack or cocaine (RR. 33, 95% CI. 18,. 62), heroin (RR. 48, 95% CI. 16, 1.25), and to having ever received treatment for a drug problem (RR. 46, 95% CI. 23,. 90). Conclusion: In conclusion, age-based factors correlate with participant's history of substance use. Ascertainment of these variables among inmate populations has the potential to improve treatment decisions both during and after incarceration.

N2  - Much concern has been expressed about the high prevalence of tuberculosis in prisons in industrialised countries. Since there is almost no information from developing countries, we investigated the rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in a large prison in Malawi.
Between May and July, 1996, we carried out an active case-finding survey in Zomba Central Prison, Malawi, through the National Tuberculosis Control Programme. We interviewed prisoners, and those with a cough of at least 1 week's duration were screened by sputum-smear microscopy. If microscopy was negative, prisoners underwent chest radiography. We offered HIV testing, with voluntary consent and counselling before and after tests, to all prisoners, whether positive or negative for pulmonary tuberculosis.
914 (70%) of 1315 prisoners were screened (905 men, nine women; mean age 30 years [SD 11]). 47 (5%) screened prisoners (all men) had pulmonary tuberculosis: 14 were taking antituberculosis treatment and 33 were undiagnosed at the start of the study; 18 were sputum-smear positive and 15 were sputum-smear negative. 16 (73%) of 22 prisoners with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis and 30 (75%) of 40 prisoners with cough but no evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis were HIV seropositive. In all prisoners, except one, symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis had developed after they had entered prison.
We found a high rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in Zomba Central Prison, which suggests active transmission of tuberculosis. As a result of this study, the National Tuberculosis Control Programme has implemented interventions in eight prisons in Malawi to improve tuberculosis control, including collection of health data, education of prisoners and clinical staff about tuberculosis, active screening of prisoners for pulmonary tuberculosis by sputum-smear microscopy, and active case-finding in the prisons.

N2  - The current study examines the prevalence and severity of psychiatric symptoms in incarcerated youth. A random sample of youth ages 13-17 who were referred for mental health services (n = 120) and not referred for services (n = 120) at a juvenile detention facility were studied. Psychopathology was evaluated using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and the Child Behavior Checklist. Ninety-six percent of referred youth and 69% of non-referred youth had one or more psychiatric diagnoses. Co-morbidity was common in both groups. The findings suggest that youths in the juvenile justice system have noteworthy psychopathology that often remains unidentified.

N2  - This thesis examines the treatment of the post-modern subject’s predicament in the post-industrial age through a close analysis of three seminal science-fiction dystopian works: Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 (1953), Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale (1986). My research centers on the following questions: What is the relationship between utopia and science fiction? Can utopia serve as a form of critique? What is the nature of power in postmodern dystopias? What are the ramifications of “blind” progress? I argue that the loss of human identity, freedom, emotion[s], values and even of life itself is symptomatic of the postmodern condition. I will engage in a discursive analysis of these questions drawing on the ideas of major postmodern thinkers: Michel Foucault’s concepts of power-knowledge relations and his notion of episteme, Fredric Jameson’s notions of postmodernism and postmodernity as expressed in his concept of schizophrenia, and Ernst Bloch’s conceptions of utopia, hope, and utopian impulse. I will demonstrate that all three novels present an archetype of a postmodern society entrenched in a carceral mode of existence. In the first chapter, I analyze the relationship of power-knowledge and its linkage with utopia in Fahrenheit 451. In the second, I examine the link between utopia/dystopia and empathy, emotions and mental health (as the dystopic episteme in the novel) in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? In the third chapter, I explore the issue of sexuality and utopia, as socio-political and historical constructs aimed at channeling a diversity of power relations in The Handmaid’s Tale (1986). I conclude that dystopian science fiction aims to present the transformation of the postmodern subject. The three novels discussed present [different stages in] the evolution of the postmodern utopian genre (in form and narrative). A comprehensive analysis that combines utopia as a literary form, the science-fiction genre and independent analytical methodology will be adopted as a significant mode of critique that may shed significant light on the postmodern condition in literature.

N2  - This dissertation concerns HIV/AIDS prevention and control in contemporary Vietnam, as an assemblage of Vietnamese Socialist governance, international NGO and US government mechanisms, and new biomedical regimes based on expert knowledges and international “best practices”. It maps the emergence of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam, the rise of the complex of state practices, spaces and discourses created to deal with it, the unfortunate entanglement of this apparatus with that set against “social evils,” and the rendering of HIV/AIDS a biological marker of socio-moral contagion. It examines the deadly consequences of this entanglement, the authorities' subsequent attempts at disentanglement following shifting epidemiological, political and economic conditions and Vietnam's internationally acclaimed success against SARS. It marks the new forms of exclusions and inequalities in health this generated. Broadly, I argue there was a shift from an emphasis on “The People” to one on “The Human” as the object at the center of this HIV/AIDS prevention and control apparatus, along with a shift from external enforcement (by authorities) to internal adherence (by oneself, to techno-scientific and expert discourses and practices). With the shift from enforcement (a present and past-oriented mode) to adherence (a mode that moves from the present forward), the near future has now become a target of and problem for government. As new and massively increased resources for HIV/AIDS prevention and control become available new contests over jurisdiction and precedence are breaking out between sectors of this apparatus dedicated to public security and health and human services, as well as central and local health authorities. Under these conditions new life-saving and harm-reduction programs effected and protected through and under interpersonal and political arrangements often classified in the foreign and domestic press as “corruption” are forcing reexamination of the ethical status of these practices. I argue that following my informants' stress on the “uses” of corruption, rather than their naming, a more nuanced portrait of contemporary power relations and constraints emerges, one that sheds light on the transformation, in these milieu, of the emerging ethical terrain of HIV/AIDS prevention and control in Vietnam. Third, I examine PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), investigating the friction at the meeting points between a pair of incongruous bureaucracies, their effect on local financial, facility and human resource management, and the promotion of a certain regime of accounting and audit practices. These new technologies represent a curious marriage of neoliberal rationalities and humanitarian ethics that operate by refiguring political problems in other domains as non-ideological and non-political health problems, within the framework of what I term an “ethics of an economy of virtue”. Here I track the penetration of neoliberal logics and calculations into the domain of humanitarian intervention. Truth games effected through the deployment of statistics, images, anecdotes and narratives collapse a broad range of meanings upon the subjected bodies of the ill, bodies and stories meant to stand in not only for those innumerable “others like them,” but the exchangeable, comparable virtue of the deployer. The final chapter is a fleshing out of the framework I present in the preceding chapters, using the parallel stories of two exemplary figures; a famous and controversial Saigon social worker, and a relatively unknown young woman, a homeless heroin addict and “graduate” of the Vietnamese carceral regime. These stories highlight the benefits, constraints and vulnerabilities actors working on HIV/AIDS in Vietnam within an economy of virtue face, as well as enable us to trace certain turning points in their lives against the background of the minor history of HIV/AIDS in Vietnam that I have set out.

N2  - Quality of life (QoL) is one of the most commonly used self-assessment outcome measures in chronic disease. The prison environment has specific characteristics that may affect antiretroviral treatment and adherence in HIV-positive patients. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to analyse the association between several factors and QoL in inmates on antiretroviral treatment in three Andalusian prisons. A total of 160 patients on antiretroviral treatment was enrolled. QoL was measured by means of the MOS-HIV. Of the sample, 88% were men and, of these, 53.8% were considered adherent to treatment. In the multivariate analysis, inmates who were considered adherent, who had a higher educational level, who did not receive food supplements and who were prescribed a greater number of pills were found to have a better physical and mental QoL. Likewise, those who felt unable or scarcely able to continue the treatment and who had been drug abusers for a longer time presented a lower physical QoL. Regarding mental QoL, those without a fixed abode, with difficulties in treatment or chronic disease had lower scores.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence as well as the possible risk factors of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, in 194 male prisoners who had been convicted for rape (n=105) or child molestation (n=89). HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1/2 were tested for. The participants also completed a standard sociodemographic questionnaire, indicating possible risk factors, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the life-time history of aggression. Anti-HIV antibodies were not found in any of the prisoners. HBsAg was found in 25 (13%), anti-HBc in 94 (49%), anti-HBs in 40 (21%) and anti-HCV in 13 (6·5%) subjects. Logistic regression analysis showed that anti-HCV positivity was associated with intravenous drug use (OR 20·7, 95% CI 1·1–4·9, P<0·001), while HBsAg positivity was associated separately with being foreign (OR 4·0, 95% CI 0·2–2·5, P<0·01), as well as with impulsiveness score (OR 1·06, 95% CI 0·01–0·11, P<0·02). The prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in this sex offender sample was highly increased in relation to the general population. Since it has been proved that sex offenders are a high-risk group for reoffending, monitoring their health is a necessary step towards prevention of sexually transmitted diseases being spread.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common in the inmate population of the United States. Long-standing HCV can progress to cirrhosis, which can contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. However, those inmates with histologically mild disease are unlikely to develop liver-related morbidity or mortality during their period of incarceration. Our objective was to develop an economic strategy for evaluation and treatment of inmates with chronic HCV.
METHODS AND MEASURES: A retrospective cohort analysis of 302 inmates within the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) who underwent liver biopsy for chronic HCV at the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System between 1998 and 2002 was performed. The data from this analysis was to utilized to develop a cost model for treatment of chronic HCV in this population based upon biochemical or histologic criteria. We used the perspective of the VDOC using actual costs paid to providers, hospitals, and pharmacies. The primary endpoint was cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment.
RESULTS: Eighty percent of inmates with chronic HCV were genotype 1, 49% had a normal value for serum ALT at the time of evaluation, 30% had no fibrosis, and 24% had bridging fibrosis of cirrhosis. The cost to evaluate and treat 100 consecutive inmates with peginterferon and ribavirin regardless of serum ALT and liver histology was calculated to be $1,775,900 or $35,500 per sustained virologic response (SVR). Although the cost declined by 50% if only those patients with an elevated serum ALT were treated, 45% of those inmates with varying degrees of fibrosis, and 21% with cirrhosis would not have received therapy utilizing this scenario. In contrast, the cost of performing liver biopsy and treating only those patients with any degree of fibrosis was $1,367,043; a savings of slightly more than $400,000 per 100 patients evaluated. The overall cost of treatment was most influenced by the price of peginterferon and ribavirin, which declined as the histologic criteria utilized for treatment increased.
CONCLUSIONS: A strategy in which inmates with chronic HCV are evaluated and a decision regarding treatment is based upon either biochemical or histologic criteria, which appears to balance both the health-care rights of the inmate and the impact of treating this disease on the financial and other resources of the correctional system.

N2  - Anger is a salient symptom of traumatized victims and a major sign for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the causes for the increased level of anger remain almost unknown. The present study investigates the interrelationship of anger, posttraumatic stress reactions, and social support in a group of former East German political prisoners (N = 91). Assessments included the German version of the Anxiety Disorders Schedule (DIPS) as well as measures of anger (STAXI), posttraumatic stress reactions (IES-R), and social support (SSQ). As expected, participants reported a high level of anger. Most measures of anger, posttraumatic stress reactions, and social support were significantly correlated. Within structural equation modeling, trait-anger was shown to be directly activated by the experience of chronic posttraumatic intrusions. Social support appeared to lessen the level of anger. The results confirm findings from studies on other traumatic events and provide additional information on the relationship between posttraumatic anger and social support. The findings indicate that treatments for PTSD might be effectively supplemented by addressing anger and social support.

N2  - Men entering prisons have high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), hepatitis, and HIV. This study sought to determine the acceptability and feasibility of screening for STD and hepatitis in young men released from prison. Participants were interviewed six months after release and offered free screening. Of 42 (56%) eligible men who participated in the qualitative interview, 33 (79%) provided at least a blood or urine specimen. Eight of 33 (24%) men tested had chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV). Three of 32 (9%) had chlamydia, three of 32 (9%) had trichomoniasis, two of 28 (7%) had prior syphilis, and two of 28 (7%) had HCV. Of 28 tested for HBV, six (21%) were immune, two (7%) had chronic infection, and 20 (71%) were susceptible. Barriers to screening included lack of forewarning, inconvenience, and insufficient incentive. In conclusion, screening for STD and hepatitis among former inmates can be acceptable and feasible. Forewarning, reducing the time burden, and providing monetary incentives may increase screening rates.

N2  - This study explored the relationship between childhood sexual abuse and drug use among incarcerated males. A retrospective, self-reported survey was administered over an 8-week period (September and October 2001) to a random sample of 100 men who were incarcerated in a county jail. The survey included questions about childhood sexual experiences before and after puberty, drug history and use, and sexual risk-taking behaviors.
Overall, 59% of this sample of male inmates reported some form of childhood sexual abuse, and all such instances occurred before or at the age of 13. Statistically significant relationships were found between drug use and childhood sexual abuse, with those who experienced childhood sexual abuse reporting drug use at percentages as much as 30% higher than those denying histories of childhood sexual abuse.

N2  - The research looked at processes involved in the creation of new inscriptions based on the recognition of an earth-wide carbon budget. Carbon footprints are the most ubiquitous of these new types of inscriptions; produceable, based on established knowledge of what types of movement and forces contribute to GHG production, they only rely on activity data from spreadsheets. In laboratories, climate models provide information on the general status of all of earth’s interconnected hydrological, atmospheric and biological functions. Empirical satellite data gives information on temperature, ocean levels and glacial ice. Market-based carbon credits assign costs for offsetting or sinking carbon. The research looked at all of these as different ways of seeing carbon. We’ve seen carbon in the city, in scientific centres and calculations, in processes of commodification, in acts of cultural brokerage and in efforts to coordinate responses to climate change. No doubt, there are many other ways of seeing carbon, but these few encounters highlight the reality that the visibility of climate change is based on data; data is further theorized as an “immutable mobile”. The immutability of data in the 21stcentury is primarily based on the reliability of instrumentation and the ability to digitally copy and reproduce findings. In the past, paper was the prime medium of immutability, but today, in addition to paper, there are many electronic receptacles for human inscriptions. The mobility of data allows its transfer across space and through time. The advent of digital communications ensures light-speed mobility and allows connection to numerous “centers of calculation”. It is in these centers of calculation where the work of biopolitics takes place ---the power of “making live” and “letting die”. The South African context of the research is important and shows that there are many different ways, depending on economic, political, industrial and historical contexts, to exercise biopolitical power in response to climate change. This paper began with the assertion that the Anthropocene marked a radical departure from mankind’s formerly amicable relationship with planet earth. Our relationship is now adversarial and, given the power of the earth to “take life” and “let live”, humans are living under a new form of sovereignty with earth as the temperamental monarch. The new forms of inscription have the purpose of surveiling the earth and measuring the grievances inflicted upon her, with the idea of assigning accountability and making improvements and amends where possible. There is an emerging scientific, economic and social panopticon that is seeing the earth through carbon optics and creating reimagined carceral existences.Governments, like South Africa, are implementing carbon tax and carbon credit programs to incent businesses to lower their GHG emissions. That is not to say there are not loftier motivations in the wider world, but in this study we have mostly encountered Homo Economicus. Our observations have noted that people either want to make money or save money by way of participating in the green economy. Earth’s threatening posture is yet to change our “habitus”. The changes so far are from economic coercion and not ecological conviction.

N2  - Background: Between 1995 and 1997, a tuberculosis outbreak occurred in a large, urban jail. We investigated whether the outbreak strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) was circulating in the surrounding community after that outbreak.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of people with tuberculosis in Shelby County, TN, from January 1998 through August 1999, with molecular fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains.
Results: From January 1998 through August 1999, 23% of cases in the community involved a strain of M. tuberculosis that was indistinguishable from the previous jail outbreak strain. Twelve people (63%) with that strain had no history of recent incarceration.
Conclusion: Two years after a tuberculosis outbreak in the jail, the outbreak strain was more prevalent in the surrounding community than it was during the jail outbreak. Jails can be important reservoirs of tuberculosis, which may subsequently circulate outside the institution. If efforts to eliminate tuberculosis are to be successful, the disease must be controlled successfully in such high-risk populations.

N2  - The opportunities and problems for hepatitis B vaccination programmes in prison settings are discussed. in particular, the advantages of modelling are stressed and an active case-finding approach is advocated. Measures for maintaining good case-holding are also discussed, and a 0, 1, 2 months vaccination regimen with 20 mug doses of vaccine is advocated for prison settings. A higher reference level for inferring adequate immunization is also recommended, with booster injections for inmates who do not meet the higher reference after a primary course of vaccination.

N2  - Transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) within prisons has long been suspected but has not been satisfactorily documented. We present four cases of HCV infection occurring during periods of continuous imprisonment. Each subject was HCV seronegative on entering prison and on repeat testing after 4–52 months in prison, but subsequently became seropositive. Two subjects gave a history of injecting drug use, and the most likely means of infection in the other two subjects were lacerations from barbers shears and lacerations arising from physical assault. There is an urgent need for detailed study of the incidence of HCV infection and the modes of transmission in prisons.

N2  - Background: Syphilis screening of jail arrestees has been promoted as an effective method for both disease control and surveillance. Goals: To evaluate the yield of the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail screening program in detecting previously undiagnosed syphilis, to evaluate the program as a means for monitoring community syphilis rates, and to characterize arrestees at greatest risk for syphilis infection. Study Design: From July 1994 to December 1998, arrestees brought to the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail were screened for syphilis. Annual early syphilis prevalence in screened arrestees was calculated and compared with the annual period prevalence of early syphilis in the general population of East Baton Rouge Parish, as reported by laboratories and health providers. A case-control study of cases detected at the jail from 1995 to 1997 and contemporary controls was conducted. Results: A total of 50,941 arrestees were booked into the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail, of whom 38,573 (76%) were screened for syphilis. Of the 38,573 arrestees screened, 494 (1.3%) were diagnosed with untreated syphilis. Of these, 299 (61%) were treated for syphilis before release. The estimated prevalence of early syphilis in arrestees decreased by 68% during the study period, from 0.79% in 1994 to 0.25% in 1998. During this time, the East Baton Rouge Parish community rates decreased by 79%, from 150 cases per 100,000 to 31 cases per 100,000. In female arrestees, a booking charge of prostitution was associated with syphilis (odds ratio [OR] 7.0; 95% CI, 1.5, 39.3). In male arrestees, a booking charge of felony theft was associated with syphilis (OR 4.8; 95% CI, 1.8,13.8). However, only 15 (12%) of the early syphilis cases would have been detected if screening had been based on the booking charges found to be associated with syphilis in this study. Conclusions: Routine syphilis screening and treatment in jail settings is feasible and identifies many persons with syphilis. Monitoring of syphilis prevalence among arrestees is a useful method for monitoring community prevalence of syphilis. Analysis of booking charges may be useful for determining factors associated with syphilis infection, but not for developing screening criteria.

N2  - The current study examined rurality and criminality as predictors of the lifetime HIV risk behaviors of 661 male, drug-abusing state prisoners. HIV risk behaviors included the number of lifetime sex partners, the number of lifetime drug injections, the number of times had sex with an injection drug user, and the frequency with which a condom was used. Regression analyses showed that criminality was related to the number of lifetime injections, whereas rurality was related to fewer lifetime sex partners and less frequent condom use. A rurality by criminality interaction for sex with an injection drug user was found. Specifically, those from rural areas who had more extensive criminal histories reported relatively high numbers of sex partners who were IDUs. Results are discussed in the context of rural and criminal justice interventions for HIV risk behavior.

N2  - Objective:
This study examined the predictive validity of the German translation of the Psychopathy Checklist-Screening Version (PCL-SV) for negative events during the course of the prison sentence of German prisoners.
Method:
Using the PCL-SV, we investigated 145 offenders in a German prison at the start of their sentences. We then compared the extreme groups identified by the PCL-SV—the high and low scorers—using a prospective design with respect to negative events and factors during the course of the sentences. This involved the standardized collection of data on both objective records of disciplinary incidents and subjective impressions from prison staff on the basis of operationalized criteria.
Results:
The high scorers were involved in significantly more disciplinary incidents and were also rated significantly less favourably by prison staff than the low scorers.
Conclusion:
Until now, the PCL has only been shown to predict recidivism following release from prison. The results of our study show that the PCL also has predictive validity for problems during the course of the sentence. It is therefore recommended that the PCL be used routinely at the start of the prison sentence to estimate the likelihood of subsequent difficulties.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the incidence of mental health problems based on the DSM-IV [1] among adolescents in custody in Tasmania, using the Adolescent Psychopathology Scale (APS) [2].
Methods: The APS was administered to 50 adolescents admitted consecutively to a youth detention centre in Tasmania, Australia, using a structured interview format.
Results: In this sample 46% scored positively for a mood disorder, 36% for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 32% for an anxiety disorder excluding PTSD.
Conclusions: Tasmania is no exception to the rule that adolescents in custody have a high proportion of mental health problems. This study confirmed findings of previous studies that detained adolescents had a roughly equivalent level of mental health problems as young people referred to mental health services and five times more than adolescents in the community. Therefore, all detained adolescents should be assessed for mental health problems as their risk is equivalent to that of young people referred to mental health services in the community. Youth detention centres are able to provide significant opportunities for individual therapy and group programmes for young people with mental health problems. However, to achieve a realization of this potential, detention facilities need to develop philosophies and procedures, which facilitate the development of therapeutic, as opposed to ‘punishing’, environments.

N2  - Aims. To determine HIV and hepatitis infection prevalence and correlates with risk behaviour. Design. Cross‐sectional study: voluntary. anonymous HIV, hepatitis (HCV, HBV and HDV) surveillance and questionnaire on risk factors. Setting. Korydallos Prison, Athens and Ag. Stefanos Prison, Patra, Greece. Participants. Of 544 drug users imprisoned for drug related offences, all completed the questionnaire and 533 blood samples were collected. Measurements. HIV (by anti‐HIV‐1), HCV (by antiHCV), HBV (by anti‐HBc, HBsAg) and HDV (by anti‐HDV) prevalence. Data on demography, legal status, drug use, sharing of injecting equipment. Findings. Of the 544 drug users, 375 (68.9%) had injected drugs (IDUs) at some time, 35% of whom had injected whilst in that prison. Of the 533 blood samples tested, one was positive for anti‐HIV‐1 (0.19%), 310 for anti‐HCV (58.2%), 306/531 (57.6%) for anti‐HBc, 34/527 (6.5%) for HBsAg and 12/527 (2.3%) for anti‐HDV. Prevalence rates for IDUs only were 0.27% for HIV‐1, 80.6% for hepatitis C, 62.7% for hepatitis B and 3.3% for hepatitis D. Ninety‐two per cent of IDUs injecting in prison shared needles, indicating that IDUs inject less but share more during incarceration. Multiple logistic regression revealed needle‐sharing as the most important risk factor for HCV infection in IDUs. Prior knowledge of a positive hepatitis result did not appear to inhibit IDUs from practising risky behaviours in prison. Conclusions. The epidemic of hepatitis B and C among imprisoned IDUs identified by this study constitutes a major public health problem. Prevention programmes, such as counselling, HBV vaccination, community‐based methadone maintenance treatment and syringe exchange schemes, are necessary in order to prevent a further spread. and correlates with risk behaviour.

N2  - In 1995, an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) occurred among residents of a correctional-facility housing unit for inmates infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We isolated and treated patients who were suspected to have TB. To determine risk factors for in-prison transmission of TB, we conducted a case-control study to compare inmate case patients infected with a distinct outbreak strain of TB with control subjects who resided in the HIV unit. We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of µ100 cells/mm3, case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend ≥20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P = .002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P = .003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak.

N2  - According to the recently published National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV, prisoners need targeted sexual health information. However, there is a paucity of published data on incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among prisoners in the UK. The aim of this study was to assess the sexual behaviour and spectrum of STI in a young offenders institution (YOI) in the UK. Case notes of all patients seen in a male YOI in Reading over a one-year period were reviewed. All were either self-referrals or referred by the prison staff. Age- and sex-matched patients attending the genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic at the Royal Berkshire Hospital Reading during the same period served as a control group. A total of 177 patients aged 17-20 were seen in the YOI during the study period. Ninety (51.72%) had STI vs 95 (54.91%) in the control group (P = 0.5942). Three YOI patients and four GUM attendees declined STI screening. Twenty-nine (16.38%) patients in the YOI had ≥2 sexual partners in the preceding three months vs 41 (23.16%) in the control group (P = 0.0811). Fourteen (7.90%) YOI patients had a previous history of STI vs 25 (14.12%) in the GUM clinic population (P = 0.0618). Thirty-five (20.11%) YOI patients gave a history of having injected drugs vs none amongst GUM clinic attendees. Of the 35 patients with a history of intravenous drug use four were hepatitis C-antibody positive. This study showed high rates of STI in a YOI. Past history of high risk behaviour was common and a significant number had been intravenous drug users. This study strongly supports the need for immediate care, targeted sexual health information and STI prevention in YOI in the UK.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between childhood tendencies of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) and illicit drug abuse in Japanese prisoners, and to clarify whether drug abusers with AD/HD prefer methamphetamine (MAP) more than other illicit drugs. The Japanese version of the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), which is a self‐reporting instrument to retrospectively identify childhood tendencies of AD/HD tendencies, was carried given to 413 prisoners without a drug addiction and 282 prisoners with a drug addiction (192, MAP; 53, toluene; and 37, cannabis). WURS scores were compared between prisoners with and without a drug addiction, and between MAP, toluene, and cannabis abusers. Consequently, prisoners with a drug addiction showed significantly higher WURS scores than those without the addiction (P < 0.001). Toluene abusers showed significantly higher WURS scores than cannabis abusers (P < 0.001), and included a higher proportion with scores over cut‐off than MAP or cannabis abusers (P = 0.005). In conclusion, a close relationship existed between illicit drug abuse and childhood AD/HD tendencies. Drug‐abusing prisoners with AD/HD tendencies were not prone to choose MAP over other illicit drugs.

N2  - In 2017, Canada started to implement the National Immigration Detention Framework (NIDF) with the aim of creating ‘a better, fairer immigration detention system that supports the humane and dignified treatment of individuals while protecting public safety’. This chapter has analysed the implementation of the main measures of the NDIF and its impact on young adult and adult undocumented migrants. It is based on research conducted on the Canadian detention system between 2019 and 2021 involving documentary review, analysis of statistics and qualitative interviews. The analysis shows that through technologies of criminalization through risk, privatization, bureaucratization, responsibilization and the reproduction of the condition of detainability, the immigration detention system in Canada is diversifying exclusionary discourses and practices, deepening neoliberal forms of governance and expanding forms of control and supervision into the community. As a result, immigration detention practices are reinforcing the shadow carceral state and creating an ‘autonomous detention machine’ that is increasingly sophisticated and robust while maintaining a high capacity of responsiveness and absorption of demands and critiques.

N2  - Despite substantially higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among male inmates than among men in the general population, there is a dearth of research on PTSD among incarcerated men. The current study addresses traumatic events that precede PTSD and psychiatric disorders that are comorbid with PTSD in an inmate sample. Seeing someone seriously injured or killed, being sexually abused, and being physically assaulted were the three most commonly reported antecedent traumas to PTSD. Lifetime and current rates of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and antisocial personality disorder were elevated among inmates with a diagnosis of PTSD. Two hundred and thirteen inmates participated in the study. Sixty‐nine participants (33%) met lifetime DSM–III–R criteria for PTSD, and 45 (21%) met current criteria. The findings are compared with general population samples, and implications of the findings are discussed.

N2  - Nepal's maternal mortality rate of 539 per 100 000 is one of the highest in the world, and the practice of unsafe abortion is responsible for more than 50% of those maternal deaths.2,3 Earlier, illegality of abortion compelled women seeking abortion to rely on quack or traditional abortion providers. Traditional methods for terminating pregnancy include "insertion of foreign substance[s] into the cervix such as mercury, sharp pieces of glass, or sticks pasted with herbal mixtures or cow dung" and "pressing the abdomen with a heavy grinding stone".4 Unsafe abortions could continue unless safe abortion services reach the whole of Nepal.

N2  - Aims. To describe self‐reported levels of substance misuse before arrest among remanded prisoners (unconvicted prisoners awaiting trial), to assess their degree of dependency on opiates and stimulants and to record their experiences of treatment in prison. Design. Random selection of subjects from prisons chosen to give a geographical spread across England and Wales; self‐report at semi‐structured interview, plus examination of the prison medical record. Setting. Thirteen male prisons, three Young Offenders' Institutions and three womens' prisons. Participants. Nine hundred and ninety‐five consenting, unconvicted prisoners, randomly selected from all locations within the prisons: 750 men (9.4% sample) and 245 women (82.2% of all remanded women). Measurements. CAGE Questionnaire, Severity of Dependence Scales (SDS) for daily users of opiates and/or stimulants. Findings. Before arrest, 145 (19.3%) men and 72 (29.4%) women had been dependent on street drugs; 91 (12.1%) men and 16 (6.5%) women were solely dependent on alcohol. Seventeen (2.3%) men and four (1.6%) women reported injecting drugs during this imprisonment. Mean SDS scores were 10.6 for opiate and 7.7 for stimulant users. 244 (25%) of all subjects described withdrawal symptoms on reception into custody; 157 (16%) reported being prescribed some symptomatic relief; 235 (24%) requested treatment at interview. Conclusions. By extrapolation, 1905 people‐23% of all unconvicted prisoners‐want treatment for substance misuse. This apparent shortfall in provision must be addressed; the rapidity with which remanded prisoners return to the community dictates that prison and community services should be closely linked.

N2  - This is the 1st study to examine the effects of individual- and program-level characteristics on treatment attrition within a prison-based setting. The sample of 1,446 men and women were from 19 programs. Differences were found in both individual- and program-level predictors of disciplinary discharges and dropouts. Dropouts were more likely to be women and enter treatment with lower levels of motivation. Individuals who were disciplinary discharges from treatment were more likely to be young, have a history of violence, and have a diagnosis of antisocial personality. Only 1 program factor-an emphasis on disciplinary discharge for violation of program rules-was associated with disciplinary discharge. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

N2  - Abstract Objective: To investigate the facilities for inpatient care of mentally disordered people in prison. Design: Semistructured inspections conducted by doctor and nurse. Expected standards were based on healthcare quality standards published by the Prison Service or the NHS. Setting: 13 prisons with inpatient beds in England and Wales subject to the prison inspectorate's routine inspection programme during 1997-8. Main outcomes measures: Appraisals of quality of care against published standards. Results: The 13 prisons had 348 beds, 20% of all beds in prisons. Inpatient units had between 3 and 75 beds. No doctor in charge of inpatients had completed specialist psychiatric training. 24% of nursing staff had mental health training; 32% were non-nursing trained healthcare officers. Only one prison had occupational therapy input; two had input from a clinical psychologist. Most patients were unlocked for about 3.5 hours a day and none for more than nine hours a day. Four prisons provided statistics on the use of seclusion. The average length of an episode of seclusion was 50 hours. Conclusion: The quality of services for mentally ill prisoners fell far below the standards in the NHS. Patients' lives were unacceptably restricted and therapy limited. The present policy dividing inpatient care of mentally disordered prisoners between the prison service and the NHS needs reconsideration.

N2  - OBJECTIVE--To describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorder and the treatment needs of sentenced prisoners in England and Wales. DESIGN--Population survey based on a 5% sample of men serving prison sentences. SETTING--Sixteen prisons for adult males and nine institutions for male young offenders representative of all prisons in prison type, security levels, and length of sentences. SUBJECTS--406 young offenders and 1478 adult men, 404 and 1365 of whom agreed to be interviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History of psychiatric disorder, clinical diagnosis of psychiatrist, and required treatment. RESULTS--652 (37%) men had psychiatric disorders diagnosed, of whom 15 (0.8%) had organic disorders, 34 (2%) psychosis, 105 (6%) neurosis, 177 (10%) personality disorder, and 407 (23%) substance misuse. 52 (3%) were judged to require transfer to hospital for psychiatric treatment, 96 (5%) required treatment in a therapeutic community setting, and a further 176 (10%) required further psychiatric assessment or treatment within prison. CONCLUSIONS--By extrapolation the sentenced prison population includes over 700 men with psychosis, and around 1100 who would warrant transfer to hospital for psychiatric treatment. Provision of secure treatment facilities, particularly long term medium secure units, needs to be improved. Services for people with personality, sexual, and substance misuse disorders should be developed in both prisons and the health service.

N2  - The commissioning of health services for all prisoners in publicly run prisons in England was transferred to local Primary Care Trusts in April 2006, pledging to provide an equivalent standard of health care as that in the community. We reviewed our experience of providing a specialist in-reach HIV service by performing a retrospective case notes review of all HIV-positive prisoners who accessed care from the prison genitourinary medicine service in three London prisons. A total of 112 HIV-positive prisoners were seen by the prison health-care service between April 2004 and 2006. This is the first study to look at how well HIV services are being provided during this transitional period of commissioning health services and provides insight into the challenges facing prison health-care providers. Good HIV outcomes are possible in prison but frequent transfers within the prison system and lack of effective HIV training among prison staff represent barriers to good care.

N2  - In the summer of 1991, four inmates from prison A in Upstate New York died of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. To determine the extent of resistant tuberculosis at prison A and transmission patterns, the authors interviewed staff and reviewed medical records and inmate movement histories. Contact investigation results were examined to determine tuberculin skin test conversions and to estimate risk of infection and disease for inmates who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Eight HIV-positive inmates and one HIV-negative guard, who was immunocompromised with cancer, had multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Eight died, a median of 28 days after the first culture-positive specimen was collected. All isolates had Identical seven-drug resistance and DNA fingerprint patterns. Of exposed inmates, 92 out of 306 (30%) had skin test conversions. HIV infection was not associated with becoming infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis (active disease or skin test conversion), but once infected, HIV-positive inmates were significantly more likely to develop disease than were HIV negative inmates (p <0.001). The source case transferred to prison A in February 1991, was ill with undiagnosed multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, refused medical care, and lived in the general prison population, where he transmitted the disease to other inmates. Lapses in infection control and laboratory delays contributed to this outbreak. Prisons should fully implement infection control guidelines to prevent tuberculosis transmission.

N2  - This chapter proposes that, in spite of the claims of neoliberal theorists who frame capitalist money as a singular social technology of peace, it can fruitfully be understood as a medium of systemic and structural violence and revanchism. I begin by recalling the early history of the (vindictive) monetary colonization of Turtle Island (North America) before telling three stories about the way proletarians responded to the vengeance of capitalism by appropriating and repurposing money as a platform for imagination and solidarity.

N2  - The Federal Bureau of Prisons limits hepatitis C therapy to those inmates with certain biochemical abnormalities. To evaluate this protocol, an analysis was done on data collected on hepatitis C infected inmates in the Louisiana Department of Corrections. A quality assurance database of hepatitis C infected inmates evaluated in the Louisiana Department of Corrections was reviewed for liver biopsy and laboratory results. Patients were compared as to whether they would have been biopsied under the Federal Bureau of Prisons protocol and if there were histologic differences between those who would and those who would not have been biopsied. Of 490 inmates biopsied, 26% (129) had an alanine aminotransferase level between one and two times the upper limit of normal without other biochemical abnormalities. If treating stages 2-4, 48% of these would qualify for treatment (15% if treating stages 3-4). There was no statistical difference between this group and either the group with an alanine aminotransferase level between one and two times the upper limit of normal and with other laboratory abnormalities or the group with an alanine aminotransferase level greater than or equal to two times the upper limit of normal and without other abnormalities. In the Louisiana Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Prisons protocol was neither sensitive nor specific enough at identifying those that should be considered for hepatitis C therapy.

N2  - Given my interrogation of the human experience of using video technologies from a prison, this study draws from the discourse of criminology, specifically critical criminology and prison scholarship. Visual criminological theories are also drawn upon as my focus is on prisoners’ court appearance mediated by visual technologies. The theoretical framework used is essentially Foucauldian. Foucault’s work provides a means to analyse the empirical data through concepts of punishment and surveillance, to understand video link as an emergent prison technology and the broader political significance of seemingly innocuous reforms to criminal procedure.
Michel Foucault’s work provides a means to analyse the empirical data through concepts of punishment and surveillance, to understand video link as an emergent prison technology and the broader political significance of seemingly innocuous reforms to criminal procedure. The theoretical framework used is essentially Foucauldian. The chapter analyses the empirical data to understand videoconferencing as an emergent prison technology and the broader political significance of seemingly innocuous and incremental reforms to criminal procedure. Critical criminology is a composite of intellectual pursuits and inherently interdisciplinary, often entwining issues related to feminism, gender, race, inequalities, social justice and oppressed communities. The chapter provides an overview of approach founded on Foucauldian discourse that has enabled analysis of empirical data through theories of power and surveillance to foreground the subtle and incremental reforms to criminal justice and penality. The philosophy of phenomenology is of continuing relevance in an increasingly digital world and in accounting for the relationship between humans and technology.

N2  - Aims. A survey of cocaine users was undertaken to study (i) the frequency of reported drug overdoses among cocaine users; and (ii) the frequency of witnessing drug overdoses in the same population.
 Design and setting. A cross‐sectional study as part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Multi‐city Study among injecting drug users (IDUs), phase II, was conducted in Santos Metropolitan Region, State of São Paulo, Brazil, in 1999.
 Participants. Three hundred and ninety‐six exclusive users of cocaine in the Santos Metropolitan Region, São Paulo State, Brazil were surveyed concerning their past experience with drug overdoses.
 Findings. Eighty (20%) of the cocaine users reported having experienced one or more overdoses, and 50% reported that they knew one or more other cocaine users who had died of an overdose. On multivariate analysis, being female and having spent time in jail were associated with an increased likelihood of having had one or more overdoses.
 Conclusion. Cocaine overdoses are an important and under‐recognized health problem in the Santos Metropolitan Region, and possibly in other areas of Brazil.

N2  - Data were collected from 112 sexually active adolescents incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility to identify predictors of consistent use of condoms during sexual intercourse. Adolescents completed an anonymous epidemiologic survey instrument developed by the Centers for Disease Control. The self-report survey assessed, demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors. Three factors were identified as associated with consistent condom use. These significant bivariate factors were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the independent contribution of each factor. Non-Black adolescents, adolescents who communicate with their sex partners about AIDS, and those who perceive peer norms as supporting condom use were significantly more likely to be consistent condom users. The findings suggest that Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevention programs for incarcerated adolescents that emphasize training in communication skills and modifying perceptions off peer normative behavior may be more effective in increasing the adoption and maintenance of condom use.

N2  - This study examined the effect of sexual assault history on facial recognition performance. Gender of facial stimuli and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms also were expected to influence performance. Fifty‐six female inmates completed an interview and the Wechsler Memory Scale‐Third Edition Faces I and Faces II subtests (Wechsler, 1997). Women with a sexual assault exhibited better immediate and delayed facial recognition skills than those with no assault history. There were no differences in performance based on the gender of faces or PTSD diagnosis. Immediate facial recognition was correlated with report of PTSD symptoms. Findings provide greater insight into women's reactions to, and the uniqueness of, the trauma of sexual victimization.

criminological “things” embody values, biases, and co-produce
knowledge about crime. This essay addresses the critical design
process with special attention to how designers of sexual violence
interventions can engage critically with the role of values.
Specifically, I look at one approach to value-responsible design, to
show how value-hypotheses can lead to more
meaningful and victim-centered criminological interventions. I
discuss STS perspectives on how designed “things” embody values and
produce cultural knowledge. I then apply these insights to analyze
two sexual violence interventions—the rape kit and a digital rape
reporting app—and explore how design should engage value-hypotheses
to best serve the criminological problem at hand. I argue that
value-hypotheses provide a useful approach to using the
criminological imagination to create more victim-centered and
meaningful interventions. In conclusion, this project sheds new
light on how critical design can promote alternative values in
carceral spaces.

N2  - Background: Trichomonas vaginalis is a common pathogen that is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and may serve as a cofactor in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Goal: To define the epidemiology of trichomoniasis in a population of newly incarcerated pregnant women in New York City. Study Design: Prospective study of 213 pregnant prisoners attending prenatal clinic. Patients participated in an interview regarding sexual and drug-related behaviors, and underwent direct culture for T. vaginalis in addition to routine testing for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Results: The prevalence of trichomoniasis was 46.9%. On univariate analysis, there was a significant association between trichomoniasis and older age, crack use, prostitution, known HIV infection, and positive serological test for syphilis. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association of trichomoniasis with crack use and positive serological test for syphilis. Conclusions: Trichomoniasis is highly prevalent in pregnant prisoners in New York City. The extent of disease observed may justify a formal program of testing and treatment and emphasizes the urgent need for harm reduction education and expanded HIV counseling and testing services in this high-risk population.

N2  - Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) (Carstensen, 1992, 1993) accounts for lifespan changes in human social networks and for the motivations which underlie those changes. SST is applied in this research with 256 prison inmates and non-inmates, ages 18–84, from Mississippi, Kansas, and New Mexico. Two research questions sought to identify (a) whether inmate networks change in size, and (b) whether overall closeness within an inmate's network changes over the adult years. Results indicate that older inmates, much like older non-inmates, have few peripheral partners, are buffered from the wider population of prisoners, and interact within a small group of very close partners. Although older inmates are not completely isolated, they do maintain fewer network partners as age increases, like their non-incarcerated counterparts, and overall are as emotionally close to network members as non-inmates.

N2  - Background: Pityriasis versicolor (PV) is a mild but recurrent
superficial fungal infection of stratum corneum. Many predisposing
factors such as late teen and young adulthood age, tropical and
subtropical climate (and to a lesser extent temperate climate),
immunosuppression, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives,
hyperhidrosis, poor hygiene and a few other factors have been proposed
for this condition. Aim: Regarding these probable and possible risk
factors, we felt that jail is a unique population which can be affected
by this infection and therefore we decided to evaluate some aspects of
this infection in this population. Methods: In this cross-sectional
study in male prisoners of Bandarabbas city, 230 prisoners were
randomly selected. One hundred and five (45.67%) of them were diagnosed
to be infected. They were also evaluated regarding age, duration of
being imprisoned, skin color, site of lesion and its pigmentation
change and any concomitant clinical manifestation such as pruritis,
burning or cebure. Chi-square test or Fisher′s exact test was
used for data analysis. Results: Mean age of infected population was
31.62 ± 8.67 years while peak incidence of PV was in 28-32 years
age group. The most common color change was hypopigmentation. No case
of PV hyperpigmentation was seen. We could not also observe any
association between skin color and duration of being imprisoned with
the frequency of infection. Conclusion: There seems to be no
difference between pattern of infection in the general population and
prisoners′ population in the aspects evaluated.

N2  - Biriz Berksoy's chapter, the last in this section, examines the transformation of policing in Turkey from the 1980s-when the military coup gave rise to brutal paramilitary death squads that crushed political leftists and punished all kinds of cultural and social nonconformity-to today, when Turkish police have become high-tech "proactive" guards, adopting discourses of risk minimization and utilizing surveillance cameras and private sector control technologies. During this period, the detention of personal enemies of the ruler gave way to a more massive and abstract carceral regime that captured those "enemies of the state" who posed a threat to the colonial and then to the neocolonial nationalist sense of social order.\n Uysal traces how leftist and anarchist forms of resistance have been mimicked and absorbed by aggressive forms of police subjectivities, all within the context of a state that, obsessed with order, is unable to imagine protest as anything but terroristic subversion.

N2  - A study on STDs was conducted among 211 female inmates in a prison in Lisbon, Portugal, in order to establish possible associations between Trichomonas vaginalis infection, sociodemographic factors and other STDs. T. vaginalis was found in 31.2% of the women, from whom only 65.1% presented symptoms. It was more frequently isolated in the 20–40 year age group. On univariate analysis there was an association, although not statistically significant, between the existence of T. vaginalis, multiple sexual partners, drug addiction and no condom use. A statistically significant association was found between trichomoniasis, prostitution and other STDs. These were found in 87% of all women. T. vaginalis was detected alone in 23.8% (15/63) of all women with trichomoniasis, while 76.2% (48/63) of them had multiple infections with trichomonas and other STDs. A statistically significant association was present between trichomoniasis and Mycoplasma hominis and infection with Treponema pallidum. This study showed that the prevalence of T. vaginalis is as high as that of multiple infections with other STDs. Therefore, our findings seem to confirm that trichomoniasis serves as a marker for other STDs. Screening for STDs should then be offered to Portuguese inmates, or, at least, these women should be screened for T. vaginalis, as a marker for the other STDs.

N2  - The use of height data to measure living standards is now a well-established method in economic history. Moreover, a number of core findings in the literature are widely agreed upon. There are still some populations, places and times, however, for which anthropometric evidence remains thin. One example is 19th century African-Americans in US border-states. This paper introduces a new data set from the Missouri state prison to track the heights of comparable black and white men born between 1820 and 1904. Modern blacks and whites come to comparable terminal statures when brought to maturity under optimal conditions; however, whites were persistently taller than blacks in the Missouri prison sample by two centimetres. Throughout the 19th century, black and white adult statures remained approximately constant, while black youth stature increased during the antebellum period.

N2  - The present study examined the comorbidity between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading disability (RD) in male adults. Participants were 120 men, of whom 24 were classified as having ADHD. The basis for the diagnosis was two self-report scales validated by interviews and background data. An extensive battery was used to assess phonological abilities and various aspects of reading skills. No differences were obtained between adults with and without ADHD on measures of either phonological processing skills or word decoding, indicating a low comorbidity with RD. This finding was valid even when different criteria were used to diagnose RD. However, the two groups differed in reading comprehension, with individuals with ADHD performing poorly in tests of reading comprehension. These results are compatible with the view that reading comprehension involves many of the higher cognitive control functions assumed to be impaired in ADHD. However, these attentional control functions are not critical to word recognition, which is determined by a more encapsulated phonological processing module. The pattern of associations between ADHD and RD observed in the present study is explained with reference to the differential attentional demands of the two aspects of reading.

N2  - In July 2012 I traveled to Washington, DC, to take part in a workshop on trafficking and technology. The workshop was attended by a broad range of actors, including government officials, tech-industry leaders, nongovernmental actors, law-enforcement agents, researchers and a trafficking victim turned survivor-advocate-leader. The meeting was informative on multiple counts, yet it was in an informal exchange that occurred after the workshop ended and during a more casual lunch conversation that my education on trafficking and technology really occurred. It was then that I came more fully to appreciate the longitudinal effects of the criminal-justice system on people who

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to document the phenomenon of tattooing and piercing in prisons in Quebec and to identify factors underlying the intention of inmates to demand that equipment used in prison for piercing and tattooing be cleaned with bleach. Method: A total of 1,434 inmates recruited in seven prisons completed a questionnaire with the help of a community worker. The questionnaire was developed using an integrative model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Results: One third of respondents had been tattooed in prison in the past and 2.6% had a piercing; 27.2% of the tattooing and 30.5% of the piercing were carried out using unsafe equipment. Three quarters of the respondents expressed a firm intention to demand that equipment used for tattooing or piercing be cleaned with bleach. Logistic regression analysis showed that personal normative beliefs (OR 5.09; 95% CI 3.54-7.32), perceived behavioural control (OR 3.55; 95% CI 2.48-5.08) and role beliefs (OR 3.23; 95% CI 1.72-6.06) were the significant determinants of intention. Conclusion: Interventions aimed at encouraging safer tattooing and piercing activities in prison should focus on inmates' sense of responsibility, obstacles impeding adoption of this behaviour and promotion of this behaviour as an integral part of the culture in the prison environment. Objectifs : Cette étude visait à documenter le phénomène du tatouage et du perçage dans les prisons du Québec, ainsi qu'à cerner les facteurs qui pousseraient des personnes incarcérées à exiger que le matériel utilisé lors des tatouages et perçages effectués en prison soit nettoyé à l'eau de Javel. Méthode : Au total, 1 434 détenus recrutés dans sept prisons ont répondu à un questionnaire avec l'assistance d'un intervenant communautaire. Le questionnaire avait été élaboré à partir d'un modèle intégrateur basé sur la théorie du comportement planifié. Résultats : Parmi les répondants, 36 % s'étaient déjà fait tatouer et 2,6 % s'étaient fait percer pendant leur détention. Cependant, 27,2 % des tatouages et 30,5 % des perçages avaient été réalisés avec du matériel non sécuritaire. Les trois quarts des répondants ont exprimé la ferme intention d'exiger que le matériel soit nettoyé à l'eau de Javel. L'analyse de régression logistique a montré que les convictions personnelles (RC =5,09; IC de 95 % = 3,54-7,32), la perception du contrôle comportemental (RC = 3,55; IC de 95 % = 2,48-5,08) et les croyances dans les rôles sociaux (RC = 3,23; IC de 95 % = 1,72-6,06) étaient les principaux déterminants significatifs de l'intention. Conclusion : Une intervention visant à favoriser le tatouage ou le perçage plus sécuritaire en prison devrait principalement s'intéresser au sens des responsabilités des détenus, aux barrières à surmonter pour adopter ce comportement ainsi qu'à la promotion de ce comportement comme faisant partie intégrante de la « culture » du milieu de détention.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To determine prevalence estimates of exposure to trauma and 12-month
rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among juvenile detainees by
demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age). DESIGN Epidemiologic study of juvenile detainees. Master's level clinical research
interviewers administered the PTSD module of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
for Children, version IV (DISC-IV), to randomly selected detainees. SETTING A large, temporary detention center for juveniles in Cook County, Illinois
(which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs). PARTICIPANTS Randomly selected, stratified sample of 898 African American, non-Hispanic
white, and Hispanic youth (532 males, 366 females, aged 10-18 years) arrested
and newly detained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, version IV. RESULTS Most participants (92.5%) had experienced 1 or more traumas (mean, 14.6
incidents; median, 6 incidents). Significantly more males (93.2%) than females
(84.0%) reported at least 1 traumatic experience; 11.2% of the sample met
criteria for PTSD in the past year. More than half of the participants with
PTSD reported witnessing violence as the precipitating trauma. CONCLUSION Trauma and PTSD seem to be more prevalent among juvenile detainees than
in community samples. We recommend directions for research and discuss implications
for mental health policy.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2004;61:403-410-->

N2  - In order to know the prevalence and risk factors for coinfections by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among injecting drug users (IDUs), a cross-sectional study was carried out in two prisons of the province of Cantabria, northern Spain. Three hundred and sixty-two IDU inmates were recruited. All inmates were interviewed and their blood tested for HIV, HBV and HCV. Crude and multiple risk factor adjusted for (by polychotomous logistic regression) odds ratios were calculated. Prevalence of HBV-HCV coinfection (42.5%) was higher than HIV-HBV-HCV coinfection (37.3%), whereas monoinfections were very uncommon (overall: 13%). Long-term injectors and reincarceration were the foremost risk factors for both coinfections, showing a trend between the degree of association and the number of viruses infecting a patient. No significant relationship between coinfection status and sexual practices was observed. The results related to coinfections are consistent with previous studies of prevalence and risk factors for HIV, HBV and HCV, in indicating that the high rates of coinfections among IDU inmates emphasise the need to harm-reduction policy across prisons in Spain.

N2  - From an analysis of developmental assessments of 50 delinquents, the author found that those who received long adult sentences showed the same disabilities, past trauma, and immaturity as those who remained in the juvenile system. Half of those sent to adult prison had no prior arrests, including three 13-year-olds, a 14-year-old, and two 15-year-olds. A majority of the 50 youth had characteristics of teenagers likely to outgrow delinquency, yet more than half of them were sentenced to adult prison. The author encouraged experts to present specific recommendations for rehabilitative services to address the juveniles' disabilities, recovery from trauma, and development of mature thinking in response to the court's concerns about future reoffending.

N2  - This study investigates substance use and crimes among incarcerated adolescents. Chart reviews were conducted between 1997-2000 with 186 adolescent, male offenders, including information on demographics, substance use, and crimes. Results indicate that use of alcohol (88.7%) and marijuana (95.7%) was highly prevalent. The most widely committed crimes included possession of a controlled substance (31.8%), receiving stolen goods (17.8%), and violation of probation (17.2%). Significant differences were observed across racial ethnic groups; White nonHispanic adolescents were more likely to use cocaine, hallucinogens, and heroin than adolescents of other races. Future research examining relationships between criminal behavior, substance use, and cultural variations in use patterns and delinquency will allow more relevant intervention and prevention strategies in this population.

N2  - Aims. To assess prevalence of, and behavioural risk factors for, hepatitis B and C in drug users both in and out of contact with drugs services.
 Design. Cross‐sectional survey of hepatitis B and C prevalence using blood samples and self‐completed risk factor questionnaires.
 Participants. Three hundred and sixty injecting drug users (IDUs) in treatment for their drug use, attending syringe exchange schemes (SES), and not in contact with any services in Wirral and Manchester between 1997 and 1999, for whom test results were available for 334 (hepatitis B) and 341 (hepatitis C).
 Findings. Hepatitis B prevalence differed between groups, from 19% of those not in contact to 41% of those presenting to request a test (
p = 0.040). Prevalence of hepatitis C ranged from 48% (SES) to 62% among those presenting for a test (
p = 0.233). After multivariate adjustment, hepatitis B was predicted by prison stays (
p = 0.030) and injecting for longer (
p = 0.003). For hepatitis C, length of injecting career (
p = 0.036), having been to prison (
p = 0.034), having injected more than one drug type (
p < 0.001) and being female (
p = 0.037) predicted infection. Overall, 38% had shared some form of injecting equipment in the previous 4 weeks. People recently starting injecting were more likely to share, and sharing was more likely to occur when injecting with only one other user rather than in larger groups. Those who had previously presented for a hepatitis C test, regardless of the result, were less likely to have recently shared injecting equipment.
 Conclusions. Behaviours associated with transmission of hepatitis B and C are common among IDUs. In particular, sharing of injecting equipment was more likely in small groups and in those recently beginning injecting. More broadly, chaotic drug use and time in prison were also risk factors for hepatitis infections. When assessing prevalence of hepatitis B and C, our results suggest that figures cannot be extrapolated from those in service contact to those in the wider drug‐using population.

N2  - The relationship between prisoner client characteristics and Therapeutic Community treatment process was examined in a male program (N = 164) and a female program (N = 195). Analyses were based on client reports on a multidimensional measure of treatment process and administrative data. Prisoner clients who are older or are poly-substance users had better Community Environment scores. Clients with children and fewer lifetime arrests had better scores on Personal Development and Change. Treatment process scores were comparable for clients in the female program and the male program. However, the association of treatment process with client characteristics appears stronger in the male program.

N2  - According to Jrgens, tackling HIV in prisons needs a comprehensive strategy. "It is important to understand the promises and limits of treatment for drug use" as well as understanding that "NEPs are crucial but alone will not solve the problem", he says. Prisons systems that have achieved the most success in preventing the transmission of HIV have developed and promoted harm-reduction and treatment strategies togethermaking bleach, condoms, methadone maintenance, needle exchange, and other drug treatment available.

N2  - Research documents the challenges associated with preventing HIV/AIDS among prison inmate populations. This paper describes the predictors of protective barrier use and unprotected sexual intercourse among a sample of adult male inmates. Descriptive and scale information was collected on several variables using standard response formats. All major substance use constructs (marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol use) were assessed in terms of consumption prior to incarceration. T-tests were employed to evaluate the level of marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol use in general, as well as with particular respect to sexual situations. Linear regression analysis was conducted to determine whether the use of the substances, length of incarceration, and other demographic variables were associated with the frequency of reporting use of a protective barrier. The findings note that total years in prison, and marijuana and cocaine use were associated with inmates' risk behaviours. Marijuana and cocaine use were statistically significant predictors of risky sex behaviours.

N2  - Aims. To examine the differences in psychiatric co-morbidity between hospital and incarcerated groups of heroin addicts in Taiwan. Design. Life-time prevalence of DSM-III-R-based coexisting psychiatric disorders, including personality disorders, were surveyed Settings. A psychiatric hospital and two prisons. Participants. Two hundred and sixty heroin users who were incarcerated ir? prisons, and 47 heroin users who voluntarily sought help ill a psychiatric hospital were interviewed by board-certified psychiatrists. Measurements. Using two psychometric instruments, the Psychiatric Diagnostic Assessment (PDA) and the Structured Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SIPD-R), psychiatric co-morbidity was assessed. Findings. Different life-time rates of coexisting psychiatric disorders among heroin addicts in different settings were found: 83% of hospital subjects and 66% of incarcerated subjects were diagnosed as having at least one coexisting axis I or II disorder. The most prevalent coexisting DSM-III-R defined axis I disorders were additional substance use disorders (alcohol and methamphetamine), while the axis II disorder was antisocial personality disorder. The hospital group had a significantly higher prevalence rate of mood disorder (p<0.001), paranoid personality disorder (p<0.05) and antisocial personality disorder (p<0.001) than the incarcerated group. Conclusions. We suggest that heroin addicts with coexisting psychiatric disorders receive relevant psychiatric treatment. Those with personality disorders, especially the antisocial type, should be considered for specialized therapeutic community programmes instead of incarceration.

N2  - The aim of the study was to attempt to identify factors associated with self-reported non-compliance within medium secure unit facilities using clinical, personality, and demographic variables. A voluntary sample of 65 mentally disordered offenders were administered a range of standardised personality questionnaires, together with a newly constructed questionnaire detailing self-reported non-compliance. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that past history of drug misuse best distinguished rule breakers from non-rule breakers. The findings of this study highlight the over-riding influence of having a past history of drug misuse on ward-based rule breaking in medium secure units. This result points to the importance of ongoing substance misuse groups and/or access to addiction services within medium secure unit facilities.

N2  - Despite the Convention on the Rights of the Child, some adolescents are still detained in adult prisons in Europe. Little is known about their health status. This cross-sectional study of 67 teenagers detained in an adult prison in Switzerland shows that morbidity in this group is high.
Conclusion: These results highlight the need for developmentally appropriate health services for teenagers in adult prisons. The long-term implications of detaining adolescents in adult detention facilities also need to be discussed.

N2  - Background During World War II, more than 140 000 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) were held captive by the Japanese in conditions of extreme privation. There have been concerns that the survivors are at increased risk of degenerative neurological disorders, especially Parkinson's disease. We assembled a cohort of British ex-POWs and analysed their mortality in a 46-year follow-up study.
Methods Using records held by the War Pensions Agency, we abstracted data on 11915 British former POWs. 11134 men were traced, and observed numbers of deaths between 1952 and 1997 were compared with those expected from national rates for the male population of England and Wales. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated.
Findings Overall, mortality was lower than expected (7474 deaths vs 8796.2 expected; SMR 0.85 [95% CI 0.83-0.87]). Death rates from Parkinson's disease among the former POWs were slightly below the national average, though this difference was not statistically significant (35 deaths vs 43.2 expected; SMR 0.81 [0.56-1.13]). A similar pattern was seen for other degenerative neurological disorders (motorneuron disease 0.62 [0.31-1.11], multiple sclerosis 0.88 [0.42-1.61], and dementia 0.88 [0.68-1.11]). The former POWs had significantly lower than expected mortality from all major causes of death (ischaemic heart disease 0.81 [0.78-0.85], cerebrovascular disease 0.88 [0.81-0.95], all malignant neoplasms 0.92 [0.88-0.95], and respiratory disease 0.79 [0.74-0.85]). They also had below average rates of death from tuberculosis (0.44 [0.26-0.71]) and suicide (0.77 [0.57-1.02]), though the latter relation was not statistically significant. Mortality from diseases of the liver was increased (chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 1.68 [1.28-2.17], primary carcinoma of the liver 2.42 [1.75-3.26]).
Interpretation There is little evidence that men who were POWs in the Far East have higher rates of death than the male population generally. The only exception is diseases of the liver, which may be due to infection with hepatitis B or C virus during captivity. Death-certification data cannot provide a complete picture of physical and mental health, but the period of severe malnutrition, frequent infections, exhaustion, and intense psychological stress seems not to have increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative disease.

N2  - The Genitourinary (GU) Medicine Service was transferred from the Home Office to the NHS from April 2006 at this female prison to give prisoners access to the same quality of health care as the general public. Medline search showed no published data on the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female prisoners in the UK. The main aim was to develop a one stop sexual health shop and to determine the prevalence and risk factors for STIs, to determine the uptake rate for HIV testing, hepatitis B vaccination and cervical cytology along with requests for usage of contraceptive services. Challenges were met when introducing change to bring the services in line with the local GU medicine clinic. Review of the service at one year along with retrospective case note review from May 2006 to August 2007 was done. Of the 545 new patients seen, history of substance abuse, IVDU, sexual abuse, sex worker and past history of hepatitis C virus and chlamydia were 86%, 41%,12%, 6%, 17% and 24% respectively. The uptake rate for both STI screen and blood-borne viruses (BBVs) testing was high at 87% and 69.3% respectively. STI was diagnosed in 19.6%. Prevalence rates were: Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) 8.2%, chlamydia 5.3%, gonorrhoea 0.2%, genital warts 5.3%, HIV 0.8%, hepatitis C virus 12% and hepatitis B virus 11%. The uptake rate for 1st dose hepatitis B vaccination and cervical cytology were 70% and 92% respectively, 36 accessed contraceptive services.
Provision of one stop shop in a female prison is feasible and practical. STIs, particularly TV, and BBVs prevalence is high among the female inmates. Prevention methods targeting this population needs to be intensified.

N2  - Previous research suggested an unexplained difference in the patterns of offending behaviors among deaf people when compared to hearing people. This study, conducted in Texas, compares the incidence and types of violent offenses of a deaf prison population in comparison to the hearing prison population. Sixty-four percent of deaf prisoners were incarcerated for violent offenses in comparison to 49% of the overall state prison offender population. This finding is consistent with previous research. The most significant difference between the populations was found in the category of sexual assault, which represented 32.3% of deaf offenders in contrast to 12.3% of hearing state prison inmates overall. Factors potentially impacting violent offending by deaf persons are their vulnerability to child sexual abuse, use of chemicals, educational histories, and development of language and communication skills. Additionally, there is a widespread lack of accessible intervention and treatment services available to deaf sex offenders across the nation.

N2  - Summer 2013 may come to be defined as the season of surveillance or rather the moment in which mainstream America woke up to an expansive array of surveillance tactics advanced in the name of national security. A comprehensive public account of the National Security Agency’s spying programs is still being sorted out. And although questions about whether the NSA’s programs compromised Americans’ privacy and civil liberties remains a source of rich debate, disclosures about them couldn’t be more timely, offering new insights into surveillance techniques and their widespread implications.

N2  - Objective: To assess HIV prevalence and related risk factors among inmates at the Quebec Detention Centre (QDC).
Design: Cross-sectional prevalence study.
Methods: Inmates incarcerated at the QDC in September 1994 were asked to participate in an anonymous survey concerning HIV infection. Volunteers answered a questionnaire and provided a saliva sample during a meeting with an interviewer.
Results: The overall participation rate was 95% (618 out of 651). HIV prevalence was 2% (11 out of 499) in men. All HIV-infected men were injecting drug users (IDU) with an HIV prevalence of 9% (11 out of 129) in this group. HIV prevalence was 14% (9/63) among male IDU admitting previous needle-sharing and 3% (two out of 66) among the other IDU (odds ratio, 5.3; P = 0.028). Twelve male inmates admitted injecting drugs during imprisonment, of whom 11 shared needles and three were HIV-positive. HIV prevalence in men reporting sexual intercourse with men prior to incarceration was 10% (five out of 52). Nine of the 119 women were HIV-infected (8%), seven of whom were IDU (prevalence of 16% in female IDU). One of the two non-IDU had sexual contacts with male IDU, and the other with men who had sex with men. Tattooing was not associated with HIV infection in either men or women.
Conclusions: Prisoners constitute a group at high risk of HIV infection mainly because of the high proportion of them who are IDU. Imprisonment offers a good opportunity to provide education and preventive programs to this specific group that might otherwise be difficult to reach.

N2  - Previous studies have demonstrated increasing levels of psychiatric morbidity among the UK prison population. Few studies of this population have been conducted using systematic needs assessment instruments. We tested the hypotheses that mentally disordered offenders (MDOs) who go into prison from the community differ significantly from general adult patients in having (1) more needs and (2) more unmet needs. We compared 73 consecutive male patients who had psychotic illness and were transferred from prison with 84 male patients who had psychotic illness and were in the community. Patients were interviewed using the Camberwell Assessment of Need schedule (CAN). Inmate medical records were examined and prison healthcare staff were interviewed. The results showed that the prison group had significantly more total needs on average and significantly more unmet needs than their general adult patient counterparts. The greater unmet needs were in the following domains: psychotic symptoms, psychological distress, welfare benefits, money, daytime activities, company and food. The results suggest an inverse care law so that MDOs in the community have high rates of need and low levels of treatment and care.

N2  - Negative health consequences of illicit drug use, such as cardiovascular complications and infectious diseases, increase the likelihood of the need for health care. However, evidence suggests that, with the exception of emergency services, drug users generally are medically underserved. Furthermore, the effect of illicit drug use on health care utilization is becoming an especially important issue for the criminal justice system, because an increasing proportion of inmates in correctional institutions have a history of drug use. This 1998-1999 study of 661 incarcerated men in the Kentucky prison system focused on predictors of unmet physical, behavioral, and overall health care needs among chronic substance users. Analyses revealed that White incarcerated drug users were more likely to report unmet physical and overall health care needs than non-Whites and those with high school education or above were more likely to report unmet physical, behavioral, and overall health care needs. In addition, more episodes of serious illness, more mental health problems, and poorer self-rated health were predictive of all three types of unmet health care needs. A longer career of drug use emerged as a significant predictor of unmet behavioral health care needs, whereas more frequent drug use in the year before incarceration predicted unmet physical health care needs. Further research directions and implications for in-prison health care planning are discussed.

N2  - Although the problem of suicide in jail and prison historically has been ignored, significant insight has been gained over the past several decades due primarily to increasing litigation. This article provides a brief overview of the progress in research, programming, and policy. The new millennium offers exciting opportunities for continued growth in correctional suicide prevention. The key areas of process research, risk assessment, and public and penological policy changes are reviewed and considered vital for the field's advancement.

N2  - Although early syphilis morbidity in New York City (NYC) has declined to a record low, syphilis seroreactivity among women jailed in NYC is ∼25%. By use of a retrospective cohort-type analysis of longitudinal serologic and treatment data collected at the time of each incarceration, the incidence of syphilis infection among 3579 susceptible women jailed multiple times in NYC between 23 March 1993 and 10 April 1997 was estimated. Syphilis incidence densities were estimated by use of continuous, time-homogeneous Markov models. There was a total of 289 incident infections. The overall incidence density was 6.5 infections per 100 woman-years (95% confidence interval, 5.7–7.2), which exceeds the 1997 early syphilis rate among women in NYC by >1000-fold. The persisting high incidence of syphilis in this population underscores the importance of aggressive syphilis control in correctional settings, even in the face of declining local early syphilis rates.

N2  - Our objective was to estimate Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) genital infection point prevalence in young male inmates using a non-invasive sampling technique. All new inmates were invited into the study that consisted of a questionnaire and the provision of a urine sample for analysis. The questionnaire asked about personal characteristics, sexual history and symptoms. CT was diagnosed using nucleic acid amplification tests. In all, 13% of new inmates were found to have CT infection. One-fifth of these CT-positive individuals had symptoms of urethral infection. CT prevalence among young male inmates is comparable with results obtained from young women in UK screening programmes. Numerous factors support the integration of CT screening in prisons into the national chlamydia screening programme.

N2  - Primary objectives : To identify the incidence of head injury (HI) amongst mentally disordered offenders (MDOs) in UK medium secure units (MSUs) and test the hypothesis that patients with a history of HI are more difficult to discharge than patients without HI. Design, methods and procedures : One hundred and thirteen MDOs being discharged to community settings from five MSUs in England were recruited consecutively between 1 April 1999 and 31 December 2000. Data on previous HI, offending history and discharge planning were collected from clinical casenotes, structured questionnaires and interviews with clinical staff. Main outcomes and results : More patients with HI (57.4%) than patients without HI (47%) had a violent index offence. Risk assessments carried out prior to discharge showed patients with HI to be at greater risk of violence to others and of self-harm than patients without HI ( p &#104 0.05). All but two patients in the HI group were difficult to discharge (43, 95.6%), compared to 52 (82.5%) in the non-HI group. Conclusions : Information on previous HI should be collected on admission to MSUs and considered when planning for discharge.

N2  - Abstract Motivational interviewing (MI) has been found to be an effective treatment for substance using populations, including incarcerated adolescents. Although some studies suggest MI is more successful with individuals from minority backgrounds, the research remains mixed. The current study investigated the impact of ethnicity on treatment in reducing alcohol and marijuana use among incarcerated adolescents. Adolescents (14–19 years of age) were recruited from a state juvenile correctional facility and randomly assigned to receive MI or relaxation therapy (RT) ( N = 147; 48 White, 51 Hispanic, and 48 African American; 126 male; 21 female). Interviews were conducted at admission to the facility and 3 months after release. Results suggest that the effects of MI on treatment outcomes are moderated by ethnicity. Hispanic adolescents who received MI significantly decreased total number of drinks on heavy drinking days (NDHD) and percentage of heavy drinking days (PHDD) as compared to Hispanic adolescents who received RT. These findings suggest that MI is an efficacious treatment for an ethnic minority juvenile justice-involved population in need of evidence-based treatments.

N2  - A total of 178 Danish male remand prisoners were examined using comprehensive interviews and questionnaires on psychopathological, personality and social measures. and file data. These data were compared with scores on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist — Revised (PCL‐R). Subjects were divided into four groups according to quartile PCL‐R scores. In general there were high rates of psychiatric morbidity in all PCL‐K quartile groups. The medium‐high scorers represent a more vulnerable group with a high prevalence of dependence disorders, relatively high neuroticism score and relatively high prevalence of neurotic and stress‐related disorders. The high scorers were more psychosocially maladjusted, had more often made previous suicidal attempts, and had a higher psychoticism score. Chronic psychotic disorders did occur, mostly in the high‐scoring group. The population had lower scores on the PCL‐R than in most previous studies, suggesting a lower prevalence of psychopathic features among Danish criminals and possibly a lower cut‐off point when using the PCL‐R as a categorical measure. Both findings are consistent with the results of other European studies. Further studies on cross‐cultural differences with regard to PCL‐R psychopathic features and on psychic vulnerability related to PCL‐R scores and factor l/factor 2 of the PCL‐R are suggested.

N2  - The article is aimed at reporting the characteristics of the population detected at State Prosecutors' Offices including the two such offices that existed in the city selected for the study, one located in a general hospital for the inspection of violence-related cases (n = 156); and the second in the facility where all detainees are taken when arrested (n = 129), and where victims can file a complaint (n = 186). A household survey undertaken among the population 18 to 65 years of age (n = 887) was used as a group of reference. Both studies were undertaken in Pachuca City, the capital of Hidalgo, located 100 km from Mexico City during the second half of 1996. Face-to-face questionnaires were used to obtain sociodemographic data, drug use and drinking patterns, depressive symptomatology, and family violence. Discriminant and logistic regression analysis were undertaken. The age group from 18 to 24 displayed the highest number of legal complaints and arrests (OR = 1.773). The likelihood for appearing at a State Prosecutor's Office was higher for those living in an atmosphere of threats and injuries within the family (OR = 19) and for those that reported alcohol consumption on the day of the event (OR = 14). Extremely high rates of family violence were obtained in this sample, increasing the likelihood of arriving at the Prosecutor's Office either because arrested or for being a victim. Results confirm the relationship between alcohol use, depression, and violence, reinforcing the need to prevent alcohol abuse,1 especially among youth.

N2  - Primary pulmonary artery leiomyosarcomas are rare, and the diagnosis is usually confused with other, more common, diseases, especially pulmonary embolism. A 52-year-old male, previously healthy, sustained a cardiac arrest. Chest CT-angiography diagnosed a "saddle embolus." Local thrombolysis was tried without any obvious success. At this point, the possibility of neoplasm was entertained. A cardiac MRI showed a nonhomogeneous mass in the proximal pulmonary artery. Successful surgery was performed, and histological examination of the resected mass was consistent with leiomyosarcoma. A follow-up cardiac MRI showed no residual mass. The dilemma associated with diagnosing pulmonary artery leiomyosarcomas will be discussed.

N2  - Introduction: Oral ivermectin has been widely used to treat various human diseases, such as filariasis, myiasis, larva migrans, strongyloidiasis and scabies (both the common and crusted forms). However, there are only a small number of papers on the effects of this drug for the control of scabies in infested environments. The current study shows the results obtained with the collective treatment of inmates of a public jail. Materials and methods: A total of 123 inmates living in a restricted and contaminated environment were evaluated clinically by experienced dermatologists for the assessment of the degree of infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, and were then treated with oral ivermectin (200-300 g kg single dose repeated after 7 days). Both clothing and environment were disinfected. Patients were re-evaluated after 15 days. Results: In all, 78% of the inmates were infected upon initial evaluation. Re-evaluation 15 days after repeat treatment revealed a cure rate of 91.05%. Prophylaxis was also highly effective, where 93.2% of the non-infected inmates and virtually all the house staff remained disease-free throughout the study period. Two of the 29 inmates (6.8%) who showed no apparent lesions upon initial examination were found to be infected upon re-evaluation. These patients responded well to a third dose of ivermectin. Conclusions: Oral ivermectin at a dose of 300 g kg single dose repeated after 7 days proved effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of scabies in an infected institutional environment.

N2  - Background: In conjunction with a program to expand syphilis and HIV infection services, women were also offered screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) during intake at the Baltimore Women's Detention Center. Goal: The goal was to assess the effectiveness of a routine screening program for CT and GC in women in a detention setting. The association among infection, race, and area of residence was also explored. Study Design: CT and GC prevalences were determined and analyzed by demographic data, including zip code, for 1858 women enrolled over a 48-week period. Informed consent was obtained, and infections were detected with use of urine samples tested by ligase chain reaction. Results: Overall, the population had prevalence rates of 5.9% (109/ 1858) and 3.4% (63/1858) for CT and GC respectively. Among whites, CT and GC prevalences were 9.0% (29/323) and 8.7% (28/323), respectively. Among African Americans the prevalence rates were 5.1% (77/1510) and 2.3% (34/1510) for CT and GC, respectively. White women <25 years of age were associated with the highest CT and GC prevalences, at 20.0% (13/65) and 13.9% (9/65), respectively. African American women <25 years of age also were associated with the highest CT and GC prevalences, at 13.9% (24/173) and 5.8% (10/173), respectively. Multivariate analysis of risk factors and demographic data indicated that ages <25 years and 25 to 34 years, white race, and certain zip codes of residence were risk factors for infection. Conclusion: This study illustrated that urine-based screening for CT and GC is feasible in detention settings and can be productive in high-prevalence areas. Geographic analysis demonstrated no definitive relationship among race, infection, and area of residence, although it did demonstrate clustering of infected individuals and could be useful in future interventions. These findings demonstrated the need for implementing screening programs for sexually transmitted infections in detention centers.

N2  - This study examines the extent to which severely mentally disabled (SMD) patients in one county mental health system were incarcerated in the local jail and examines characteristics of a sample (N = 30) of such individuals. We found that in the study year, 7.9% of known SMD patients had at least one incarceration in the county jail. Diagnoses were predominantly in the schizophrenia spectrum with 70% also actively abusing substances at the time of incarceration. The majority of crimes were non-violent and substance abuse related. Half of the sample was judged to be candidates for diversion programs. Our findings are consistent with recent literature confirming that substance abusing SMD individuals are at high risk of incarceration and could benefit from integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment.

N2  - Objective: Although the two political systems cannot be equated, the psychiatric and psychosocial issues raised by people detained under the migration regulations of the present Australian government, and those detained under the security legislation of the last apartheid government in South Africa, are similar in many aspects.
Method: We present two case scenarios representative of the cumulative clinical experience of the authors in their work (as part of their routine clinical practice and medical school experience) with asylum seekers and political detainees in acute psychiatric units in both South Africa and Australia.
Results: Similar issues raised included the validity of a psychiatric diagnosis in these patients and the debate this conundrum provoked among the multidisciplinary teams. The pressures placed on clinicians by politicians in terms of clinical management of hospitalized detainees raised similar ethical questions across both countries. The clinical syndromes of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were similar. The effect of the ‘non-person’ status conferred upon refugees by the ‘temporary protection visa’ could be equated with the effect of ‘banning orders’ imposed on opponents of the Apartheid regime.
Conclusions: In South Africa, political detainees entered into the struggle expecting to face hardship and torture at the hands of the government of the time. Asylum seekers flee to Australia expecting support from a democratic system and generally had not prepared themselves for further incarceration and yet another political struggle. Despite this seemingly fundamental difference, the experiences of detainees across two very different political systems are remarkably similar.

N2  - Background: With prostitution and drugs the most common reasons for arrest among New York City (NYC) women, female arrestees are at high risk for acquiring syphilis and delivering congenitally infected babies. Despite routine syphilis screening of all NYC inmates, many are released before the need for treatment is recognized, and once released, few could be found for treatment. Goals: To improve syphilis treatment rates among female correctional inmates in NYC. Study Design: At a women's correctional health clinic, on-site, rapid, qualitative nontreponemal syphilis testing (STAT rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) and on-line access to the local syphilis case registry were introduced to supplement the usual admission medical evaluation. Treatment decisions made using the authors' jail protocol were compared with treatment criteria used in NYC's sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Patients consisted of a consecutive sample of 685 remandees admitted one or more times during the day shift, March 24, 1993, to July 31, 1993, who had a full complement of mandatory admission medical tests. Using the study protocol, syphilis treatment decisions were made and needed treatment was furnished at the end of the admission medical evaluation. The main outcome measures were correct identification and treatment of syphilis in this population, compared with standard NYC Department of Health (DOH) STD clinic practice, as well as the effect of the jail protocol on pregnancy outcomes and need to treat offspring for congenital syphilis. Results: Compared with NYC DOH STD clinic practice, the study protocol was 95% sensitive and 88% specific in arriving at appropriate treatment for syphilis. Treatment at the end of the admission medical evaluation increased syphilis treatment rates from 7% to 84% of women with indications for treatment and to 88% of pregnant women with indications for treatment. Prospective follow-up for birth outcomes revealed no spontaneous abortions and eight live births. Seven of the eight did not need congenital syphilis treatment because their mothers were adequately treated while incarcerated. Conclusions: Qualitative (or STAT) RPR testing and access to DOH syphilis case registry data provide prompt and accurate diagnostic information that can lead to an overall increase in the number of inmates appropriately treated (with a minimum amount of overtreatment) in a women's correctional facility. This protocol may be applicable in other high-risk, transient populations.

N2  - Aptly described in Joseph Conrad’s phrase as the ‘historian of fine consciences,’¹ Henry James has heretofore been little associated with Victorian prisons and penitentiaries.² Therefore, James’s explicit exploration of carceral spaces and tropes inThe Princess Casamassima(1886) andIn the Cage(1898) represents an area of critical oversight that deserves investigation. Explicating imprisonment in these two works reveals larger preoccupations in James’s oeuvre, including an awareness of how mental sequestration can be caused by class divisions and social prejudices as well as by perceptual limitations.

N2  - Background Studies have demonstrated the importance of patient perceptions' of mental health service quality. No studies, however, could be found that surveyed recipients in prison, despite the rapid growth of patients, and litigation in these settings.
Method Patients were asked to complete an anonymous survey in private, and sealed it in an envelope.
Results Of 613 respondents, most were satisfied (79%), agreed they had sufficient access to therapists (78%), were involved with treatment decisions (84%), and thought the MH services they had received would help them better deal with a crisis and emotional stress (75%). There were differences among mental health programs/housing units. Several of perception questions were significantly correlated with medication compliance, admission to crisis observation cells, and receiving disciplinary infractions.
Discussion Random samples were requested, but likely only a convenience sample was obtained. However, the positive results suggest the need to strive to enhance patient quality of care ratings.

N2  - Surveys of prisoners have demonstrated a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. There is increasing concern that behavioural disorder secondary to psychiatric morbidity may be perceived and dealt with by prison staff as a disciplinary problem instead of as illness-related behaviour. A survey among prisoners in England and Wales identified the characteristics of those who had been placed in disciplinary segregation. There was no evidence that prisoners with severe mental illness were more likely to report disciplinary segregation following adjudication under the prison rules. Segregated prisoners were more likely to be younger, with histories of violent offending, career criminality, early environmental disadvantage, anti-social personality disorder, drug misuse - specifically crack cocaine - and higher scores of psychopathy. Disciplinary segregation may be an indicator of increased risk of future offending.

N2  - Two studies were conducted to identify individual characteristics that predict behavioral responses to violence prevention interventions. These studies used embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to create hypothetical social situations (called virtual vignettes) to assess interpersonal competency skills. One study was of male inner-city African–American adolescents, and the second was of male prisoners in a state correctional system. In pre- and post-intervention sessions, participants interacted with an ECA that tried to entice them into making risky decisions. The virtual vignette sessions tested participants’ negotiation and conflict resolution skills. Results showed differing tendencies for participants to be engaged by the virtual vignettes. The vignettes were sufficiently realistic to elicit differences in behavior among the adolescents, but generally not for the prisoners. Prior acceptance, accessibility, and usability data suggest that most users readily accept ECAs as valid conversational partners. The evidence presented here suggests that the technology – or the setting in which the technology is used – is not by itself sufficient to actively engage users. The usefulness of virtual vignettes to adequately predict future behavior may be at least partially influenced by participant characteristics.

N2  - Objectives. This study reports responses of incarcerated persons to voluntary blood and oral HIV testing.
Methods. Males and females in local detention and juvenile justice facilities in Maryland (n = 1314) chose oral or blood testing and reported reactions to the oral HIV test. The relationship of demographics and HIV risk factors to test choice was examined.
Results. Reactions to oral testing were very favorable; some participants reported that they would not otherwise have been tested. Participants who chose oral testing were more likely to be male and African American, but they did not differ from those who chose blood testing in most risk factors or in seroprevalence.
Conclusions. Oral HIV testing in correctional settings may promote voluntary testing among persons who otherwise would refuse or avoid testing, especially among groups (males and African Americans) disproportionately affected by HIV.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Studies have shown that sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates are high in the incarcerated population. However, little is known about STD testing policies or practices in jails. Goal: To assess STD testing policies and practices in jails. Study Design: The Division of STD Prevention developed and distributed an e-mail survey to 94 counties reporting more than 40 primary and secondary cases in 1996 or having cities with more than 200,000 persons. State and local STD program managers completed the assessment in collaboration with health departments and the main jail facilities in the selected counties. Results: Most facilities (52-77%) had a policy for STD screening based only on symptoms or by arrestee request, and in these facilities, 0.2% to 6% of arrestees were tested. Facilities having a policy of offering routine testing tested only 3% to 45% of arrestees. Large facilities, facilities using public providers, and facilities routinely testing for syphilis using Stat RPR tested significantly more arrestees (P < 0.05). Approximately half of the arrestees were released within 48 hours after intake, whereas 45% of facilities did not have STD testing results until after 48 hours. Conclusion: Most facilities had a policy for STD screening based only on symptoms or by arrestee request. Facilities having a policy of routine STD testing are not testing most of the arrestees. There is a small window (<48 hours) for STD testing and treatment before release. Smaller jails and facilities using private providers may need additional resources to increase STD testing levels. Correctional facilities should be considered an important setting for STD public health intervention where routine rapid STD screening and treatment on-site could be implemented.

N2  - Abstract Incarcerated women have high rates of substance abuse problems and trauma. A variety of variables may influence whether these women seek help or are referred for substance abuse problems. This study reports an exploratory project on service utilization among incarcerated substance-dependent women ( N = 40) in southeastern Idaho. Using self-report and interview tools, most participants reported some substance abuse treatment history, although extent and types of treatment varied. Most of the women also reported some type of childhood abuse. Age, income, and consequences of alcohol and other drug use related positively to substance abuse treatment. However, severity of childhood sexual abuse and current trauma symptoms were negatively correlated with substance abuse treatment episodes. These women may use substances to cope with childhood trauma or may not perceive the substance abuse system as responsive to their co-occurring trauma symptoms.

N2  - Prison as the visual location of punishment is in retreat. The chapter draws on data from the broader study of prison architecture, design and technology to which Ellie Slee's PhD is linked. It stimulates debate within visual criminology about the role of prison architecture and design in mediating our relationship to the individuals confined within. The chapter suggests that contemporary carceral aesthetics have a mimetic quality, sequestering offenders, sanitizing the pains of imprisonment, and eliciting ignorance and apathy in the spectator. It provides narratives of Ellie's visual impressions of the exterior appearances and surroundings of two very different prisons. The first, HMP Manchester (Strangeways) was completed in 1868; the second, HMP Oakwood, just outside Wolverhampton in the English midlands, was constructed in 2012. As Ellie's vignettes illustrate, the emotional experiences involved in looking – the 'affective dimensions of spectatorship' as Young puts it – are not necessarily rousing, sensate experiences.

N2  - During World War II, the US Public Health Service (USPHS) administered health care to 19 000 enemy aliens and Axis merchant seamen interned by the Justice Department through its branch, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
The Geneva Prisoners of War Convention of 1929, which the United States applied to civilian internees, provided guidelines for belligerent nations regarding humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war, including for their health. The INS forged an agreement with the USPHS to meet these guidelines for the German, Italian, and Japanese internees and, in some cases, their families. Chronic shortages and crowded camps continuously challenged USPHS administrators.
Nevertheless, the USPHS offered universal access to care and provided treatment often exceeding care received by many American citizens.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of family background and preincarceration socioenvironmental variables on three-year post-release drug use for African American and white prison-based drug treatment participants in order to explain the previously found disparities in rates of three-year post-release drug use between the two groups. There were two hypotheses: 1) for both groups, family background and preincarceration socioenvironmental variables would predict postrelease drug use more strongly than sociodemographic characteristics and preincarceration behaviors, and 2) the predictors would be different for each group. The sample included 279 African American and 512 white male treatment participants who were supervised by a U.S. probation officer following incarceration. Event history analyses were used to model time to first drug use during postrelease supervision. The results indicated that none of the family background factors or socioenvironmental variables predicted postrelease drug use. The variables predictive of drug use for one or both racial groups were limited to sociodemographic characteristics and preincarceration behaviors such as age at release, prior commitments, and preincarceration employment. Yet, there were no significant between-group differences for these predictors. The authors concluded that future assessment of the effects of socioenvironmental variables on postrelease drug use likely requires evaluation of the postrelease social environment at the time of release.

N2  - Aims. To identify the correlates of injecting drug use within prison.
Design. A national cross‐sectional study, participation being voluntary and anonymous.
Setting. Ten Greek prisons.
Participants. A representative sample of 1000 male inmates; 861 questionnaires were completed and analysed.
Measurement. A self‐report questionnaire for demographics, penal history, drug use and sharing injecting equipment.
Findings. Two hundred and ninety inmates (33.7%) reported injecting drugs at some time in their lives, of whom 174 (60%) had injected while imprisoned. Among those who had injected while imprisoned, 145 (83%) had shared equipment while incarcerated. Logistic regression analysis suggested that total time in prison, previous drug conviction, being a convict (as opposed to on remand) and having multiple female sexual partners 1 year before incarceration were significant HIV risk behaviour correlates. For every year of imprisonment, the risk of injection in prison increased by about 17% \[OR = 1.17 (95% CI: 1.07‐1.27)]. Inmates with a previous drug‐related conviction were about twice as likely to inject within prison \[OR = 1.97 (95% CI: 1.16‐3.33)]. Finally, convicted inmates were marginally significantly more prone to inject in prison \[OR = 1.58 (95% CI: 0.92‐2.74)].
Conclusions. Variables related to the inmates' prison career influence HIV risk behaviours within prison. There is a need to assist IDUs in reducing the likelihood of high‐risk behaviour by considering factors such as frequency of incarceration, length of time incarcerated and availability of detoxification programmes within prison.

In this article, this role is illustrated by examples and the international set of rules is described. It is emphasised that under no circumstances should physicians assist in procedures, such as torture, which can weaken a human being. There is ongoing research into the sequelae of torture, both by gross and microscopic examination and in the living and dead victims.

N2  - Women offenders constitute a small minority of prisoners in England and Wales, but also the sub-group of prisoners with the fastest growth curve. High rates of mental disorder have been established amongst such women but the extent to which their treatment needs are met is less clear. The aim was to identify and describe women who gain placement in the health service under the Mental Health Act (MHA) 1983 and to compare those under the MHA classifications of 'psychopathic disorder' (PD) and 'mental illness' (MI). From all new receptions to Holloway Prison - London's prison for pre-trial and sentenced women - between 1st January 1995 and 31st December 1995, those gaining an MHA 1983 disposal were identified. A full record search was done for each woman in this sub-group. Among 3,309 new receptions, only 62 women were transferred from prison to inpatient health services. Full data were available for 26 women under the MHA 1983 category of PD and 34 under MI. The women in the PD group were significantly more likely to have had a history of self-harm and of sexual abuse as a child than women in the MI group, but the PD women remained significantly longer in prison awaiting a hospital bed. It is doubtful whether these women had an adequate response from the health service. Despite manifest need, even among those accepted for in-patient treatment, those with personality disorder appeared disadvantaged compared to those with mental illness. This was a group particularly prone to self-harm, at a time when completed suicide in prison continues to rise. Further research on the specific difficulties in effecting transfer may assist, but it seems likely that there may be a training issue to ensure that health service personnel understand the risk to these women if their needs are not met.

N2  - Abstract Objectives: To assess, as part of wider inspections by HM Inspectorate of Prisons, the extent and quality of health care in prisons in England and Wales. Design: Inspections based on a set of “expectations” derived mainly from existing healthcare quality standards published by the prison service and existing ethical guidelines; questionnaire survey of prisoners. Subjects: 19 prisons in England and Wales, 1996-7. Main outcome measures: Appraisals of needs assessment and the commissioning and delivery of health care against the inspectorate's expectations. Results: The quality of health care varied greatly. A few prisons provided health care broadly equivalent to NHS care, but in many the health care was of low quality, some doctors were not adequately trained to do the work they faced, and some care failed to meet proper ethical standards. Little professional support was available to healthcare staff. Conclusions: The current policy for improving health care in prisons is not likely to achieve its objectives and is potentially wasteful. The prison service needs to recognise that expertise in the commissioning and delivery of health care is overwhelmingly based in the NHS. The current review of the provision of health care in prisons offers an opportunity to ensure that prisoners are not excluded from high quality health care. Key messages The standard of health care in prisons in England and Wales varies widely—a few provide a quality of care close to that in the NHS, but many provide low quality care The commissioning of health care and the monitoring of services in prisons are inadequate More exacting standards for appointing doctors, a mandatory system for continuing professional development, and better support for healthcare staff are needed A better ethical framework is essential The NHS should be more involved in both the commissioning and the provision of health care in prisons

N2  - Judge Henry Wingate explained the importance of the right to vote and the use of disenfranchisement as a form of punishment as follows:Disenfranchisement is the harshest civil sanction imposed by a democratic society. When brought beneath its axe, the disenfranchised is severed from the body politic and condemned to the lowest form of citizenship, where voiceless at the ballot box ... the disinherited must sit idly by while others elect his civic leaders and while others choose the fiscal and governmental policies which will govern him and his family. Such a shadowy form of citizenship must not be imposed lightly. (Shapiro, 2001)
In the liberal democracies of late capitalism, being a citizen without the right to self-representation through voting is akin to civil death (Miller & Spillane, 2012). This medieval concept describes the banishment of the convicted from the umbrella of the state-a punishment reserved for only the most heinous crimes (Agamben, 1998; Miller & Spillane, 2012). Civil death resulted in outlaw status, and left the indicted a political non-entity, both unprotected by systems of law and unrepresented in legislative structures (Agamben, 1998). Yet judicial decisions have confirmed that citizenship does not necessarily include the right to vote; rather states can decide who has that right (Schultz, 2007).
In the United States today, varying state-level practices of disenfranchising the incarcerated, those on parole or probation, those still paying court fines or fees, and those who have completed carceral sentences mean that approximately 6.1 million American citizens cannot legally vote (The Sentencing Project, 2016).

N2  - Adolescents incarcerated for sexual offenses were compared to those incarcerated for other crimes on measures of prior child abuse and neglect, serious emotional disturbance, and involvement in child welfare and the juvenile justice system. Sexual or physical abuse was more common than neglect among sexual offenders with fewer than three prior maltreatment reports. Sexual offenders were twice as likely to be receiving special education services for severe emotional disturbance, and were usually incarcerated later than other offenders. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

N2  - This study evaluated voluntary testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in a prison population with a high HIV seroprevalence. Data on demographic variables and participation in voluntary testing were linked to a blinded HIV serosurvey of consecutive Maryland prison entrants (April–July 1991). Among 2,842 entrants, HIV seroprevalence was 8.5% (men, 7.9%; women, 15.3%). Voluntary testing was accepted by 47% of the entrants, and it identified 34% of the HIV-seropositive inmates detected by serosurvey. Refusers of testing were more likely to test HIV-seropositive than were accepters (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.84, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.58–2.16). Refusers and accepters of testing had similar risk factors for HIV infection, chiefly current syphilis infection (adjusted OR = 5.96, 95% Cl 3.15–10.27) and prior injected drug use (adjusted OR = 4.26, 95% Cl 3.15–5.76). Among 100 entrants asked why they refused testing, primary reasons given included low risk of HIV, fear of testing HIV-seropositive, and lack of interest. Voluntary testing appears only moderately successful in identifying HIV seropositive inmates in a high-seroprevalence prison population. However, the alternative, mandatory HIV testing of prisoners, can be construed as discriminatory and unethical when similar screening is not imposed on the population at large. Data presented here suggest strategies to improve acceptance of voluntary testing, especially by high risk inmates.

N2  - Objectives: Despite recent success in tuberculosis (TB) control efforts in the United States, marked declines in TB case rates have not been observed in foreign-born populations. Because foreign-born populations are becoming more important for targeted national TB control efforts, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) reviewed inmate medical data to evaluate risk factors associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and active TB disease. To improve screening strategies, BOP implemented chest radiograph screening for all inmates entering a federal detention center in San Diego, California. Methods: Tuberculin skin test (TST) data from an approximated intake cohort of inmates entering the system from February 1 to June 30, 1999, were analyzed to assess risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection among inmates entering federal prisons. The most recent case reports of inmates diagnosed with TB disease were reviewed. All inmates entering a San Diego detention facility from July 1 to December 31, 1998, were screened for TB by symptom review, TST, and chest radiographs. Results: System-wide, foreign-born inmates were 5.9 times more likely to have a positive TST than US-born inmates, and accounted for 60% of recently diagnosed TB cases. Chest radiograph screening of all inmates entering the San Diego facility reduced exposure time to active TB cases by 75%, but TB incidence remained unchanged. Conclusions: The high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection and TB disease among foreign-born inmates entering the federal prison system presents a strategic opportunity to provide preventive therapy to a high-risk population and to identify contagious cases that might elude traditional public health efforts. Universal chest radiograph screening was no more sensitive than TST for detecting active TB cases among newly incarcerated foreign-born inmates with a high prevalence of TB infection, but the screening reduced potential TB exposures through rapid identification of contagious cases.

N2  - This research addresses whether prisoners who bully others and/or are victimised themselves can be distinguished by the perceptions that they have of the consequences about using aggression as a solution to being bullied. Male and female adult prisoners (n = 406) were required to complete a self‐report behavioural checklist (Direct and Indirect Prisoner Behaviour Checklist [DIPC]) that addressed the level of bullying behaviour at their present institution. Prisoners were also required to complete a questionnaire (Bullying Social Problem Solving Questionnaire [BSPSQ]) that provided them with five different bullying situations and asked them what would be the consequences if they were to respond aggressively to each. Four categories of prisoners were examined: pure bullies, pure victims, those who reported both bullying others and being victimised themselves (bully/victims), and those not involved in bullying/victimisation. Pure bullies reported significantly more positive than negative consequences of aggression compared with the overall category mean in response to theft‐related bullying. Bully/victims reported significantly more positive than negative consequences compared with the overall category mean in response to indirect and indirect‐physical bullying. Those not involved reported significantly more negative than positive consequences compared with the overall category mean in response to all scenarios except one involving indirect‐physical bullying. Males reported significantly more positive than negative consequences compared with females for all types of bullying. Aggr. Behav. 28:257–272, 2002. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

N2  - The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis a sexually transmitted disease, and the association of selected behavioral risk factors were assessed in a population of adolescents in two juvenile detention facilities. Urine was collected for Chlamydia testing and a brief interview conducted for risk and demographic information. Almost all of the 200 participants were sexually active, many before the age of 13 years. The prevalence of Chlamydia infection was 22.2% among female and 8.7% among male participants. Injection drug use was the only statistically significant variable associated with infection, Education and community services are necessary to break the cycle of infection for this high-risk population.

N2  - Current research on the relationship between schools and prisons is organized by the field of “school-to-prison pipeline” studies. The “school to prison pipeline” is a construct that describes an axial relationship: it places schools and prisons at alternate ends of a spectrum and theorizes the linear movement between the two. The aim of “school-to-prison pipeline” scholarship is to deconstruct the role of public education in conditioning a trajectory that leads to prison, particularly for marginalized minority populations who are often under-prepared by their urban schools to chart more positive paths. I build on “school-to-prison pipeline” research by elaborating the processes that spur the movement of minority students, particularly African American males, along the pipeline. I argue that this movement is facilitated by a disciplinary culture within urban public schools serving minority youth. Prison and schools share techniques of discipline and are further integrated by common leadership and coordinated efforts to fight crime. This is the phenomenon I call the prison school. In documenting the prison school, I show that schools and prisons are more closely related than the “school-to-prison pipeline” rubric would suggest. Recognizing the carceral within public education is necessary for a complete understanding of the educational processes which foreshorten educational opportunity and, thereby, foreshadow incarceration. This research, which focuses on the disciplinary culture of urban schools and its implications for racial minorities, is also, then, a study of the way in which a penal disciplinary culture in public education contributes to a broadening achievement gap. I examine prisons and schools as disciplinary institutions bound by history, ideology and practice. An historical study traces the fundamental role of schools as tools for disciplining diverse immigrant groups to a national culture. A contemporary examination charts the proliferation of “tough on crime” measures at school, and includes data on emergent high tech security technologies and zero tolerance policies at public school sites. A theoretical study with a focus on Michel Foucault establishes the particular socio-spatial dynamics of penal discipline and relates this analysis to the geometries of disciplinary power in education. Further documenting carceral discipline in education, I present an interpretive case study of a public alternative school opened at a prison. This school, serving non-criminal African American males, is a case where the criminal justice system and the public education system have literally merged. The case study of this dissertation does not represent the average prison school. It is the quintessential example of the prison school, and it establishes the broad latitude for the carceral infiltration of the public school system. It also sets a point of reference for considering the normalization of penal discipline for minority students in urban schools.

N2  - Data collected from incarcerated youth (n = 113) and a public school sample (n = 802) demonstrate that both adolescent groups have a high level of AIDS knowledge. Incarcerated youth are less aware of HIV risk-reduction behaviors and report markedly higher rates of HIV risk behaviors. Incarcerated youth are at substantially increased risk of HIV infection relative to their school-based counterparts and should be a primary target of HIV prevention programs.

N2  - The aim of the current study was to investigate the characteristics of Greek inmates that were taking regularly benzodiazepines (BZDs) at therapeutic doses, in the high-security prison of Patras, Greece. Three hundred eighty-four prisoners were included in the study. BZD users (BUs, n = 192), compared with non-BZD users (NBUs, n = 192), were significantly more often unemployed before imprisonment; were significantly more often single, divorced, or widowed; were significantly more often on remand; were taking in significantly greater proportions antidepressant and antipsychotic medications; had significantly more often a history of psychiatric hospitalization; and had significantly more often a history of illicit intravenous (IV) drug use. BUs were significantly more often positive on serum antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV), and scored significantly higher on Hamilton’s Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Zung’s Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the history of psychiatric hospitalization, history of illicit drug use, history of unemployment, symptoms of anxiety, and anti-HCV positivity were independently associated with BZD use in this prison. Medical and psychiatric interventions focusing on anxiety problems, depression, drug addiction, and HCV in this group of BUs are warranted.

N2  - One hundred consecutive juvenile drug offenders with amphetamine use in a remand center were assessed for extent of substance use and psychiatric morbidity by a psychiatrist from 1998 to 1999. They were monitored for one year after discharge. The "risk" of being recommitted to the remand center against use of various drugs and psychiatric morbidity was determined. Amphetamine-use disorder was more prevalent in those who were recommitted than those who were not, while no significant difference was found with licit substances, psychiatric morbidity, or the number of substances used between these two groups. In view of the high dependency properties of amphetamine, early intervention is suggested to prevent reuse.

N2  - Objective:
To examine rates of behavioural and substance use problems in incarcerated young offenders and to explore rural and urban differences in the expression and severity of these problems.
Method:
We assessed a sample of 68 confined male young offenders (63.3% rural and 35.3% urban), using the Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR).
Results:
Based on clinical cut-offs, data showed high rates of externalizing behavioural problems (75.4%) and substance use problems (95.7%). Urban delinquent youths showed higher rates of attention problems, delinquent behaviours, and externalizing behaviours than those in rural communities.
Conclusions:
Incarcerated young offenders show elevated rates of psychological problems that require treatment. Rural and urban differences in the rates of these problems may reflect differences in community service availability in these areas or in environmental influences on the development of child behavioural problems.

N2  - Background: Few recent studies have determined the prevalence and incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) among adolescents. Goal: The goal of this study was to determine these parameters among incarcerated youths. Study Design: Both on admission and during incarceration, consecutive adolescents entering the Harris County, Texas, Juvenile Detention Center were evaluated for symptoms of PID. One of two experienced clinicians examined adolescents with possible PID. For the diagnosis of PID, we used the minimal criteria of the CDC. Results: In sexually active heterosexual or bisexual adolescents (N = 313), the prevalence of PID at admission was 4.5%; during the first 31 days of incarceration, the incidence density of PID was 3.3 cases/100 person-months, and the cumulative incidence was 2.2%. The prevalence among these youths of chlamydial and/or gonorrheal infection, as determined by urine or cervical testing, was 24.9%. Conclusion: The high prevalence and incidence of PID underscore the need for effective programs to eradicate chlamydial and gonorrheal infections in high-risk youths.

N2  - Scope: An epidemiological study on the prevalence of stress related experiences and personality disorders was conducted on two groups of migrants who came to Germany from the former Soviet Union (Group 1, incarcerated offenders, n = 60; Group 2, migrants living in the German community, n = 30) and a group of individuals with German ancestry who stayed in Russia (Group 3, n = 30).
Hypotheses: (1) Incarcerated migrants experience more stress than those living in the community; (2) migrants to Germany show higher stress levels than those who have stayed in Siberia.
Results: Poor German language skills were associated with the high stress level of incarcerated migrants, but no evidence was found for an association between high stress levels and an elevated prevalence rate for personality disorders. Stress levels were highest in Group 1; and the prevalence rate of personality disorders was 61.7 per cent. For Group 2, the prevalence rate was 16.7 per cent and for Group 3 it was 20 per cent.
Conclusions: Stress levels in migrants from the former Soviet Union are generally elevated. They are also elevated in comparable individuals who have not migrated. Antisocial behaviour is associated with poor language skills and high stress levels, but stress does apparently not relate to the presence of a personality disorder.

N2  - This paper illustrates a ‘Conversational Model’ of art therapy. The Conversational Model was jointly created by Robert Hobson and Russell Meares. It is a developmental theory unique in its clinical application. The focus of the paper is two sessions that altered the course of therapy. In these sessions, variations on Donald Winnicott's “squiggle‐game” and Hobson's “party game” were used to engage an isolative, reluctant incarcerated patient. The interventions illustrate the basic tenets of the Conversational Model. The theoretical process – from disruption to repair – is visually recorded in the artwork. The central argument of the paper is that interactive art therapy interventions can be effective, when used appropriately. By engaging the patient in a ‘visual’ conversation, he/she may develop an emotional vocabulary, a prerequisite for a psychotherapeutic conversation. The paper begins with a brief historical overview of the interface between art and psychoanalysis, the context out of which ‘art therapy’ – a distinct body of theory – evolved. Theory interweaves with clinical material in a narrative style.

N2  - The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with imprisonment of female injecting drug users (IDUs) and to assess if female IDUs who have been in prison have different HIV risk behaviours when compared to females IDUs who have never been incarcerated. A seroepidemiological survey was conducted of 304 female IDUs recruited in outreach and treatment programmes in Madrid, Spain. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and recent and lifetime risk factors, sexual and reproductive history and history of imprisonment were collected. Bivariate analysis and a logistic regression model were used to identify factors associated with imprisonment. Risk factors for imprisonment were having illegal sources of income, not having a fixed address, leaving education before finishing primary school and starting injection of drugs early in adolescence. HIV risk behaviours were highly prevalent among this population of female IDUs and drug injection in prison was reported by more than one-third of those who had ever been imprisoned. In addition, recent HIV risk behaviour indicators were not associated with imprisonment, suggesting that incarceration did not lead to risk reduction after release from prison. Female IDUs who have been in prison have substantial reproductive health problems that require gynaecological care. These results point to the urgent need for prevention programmes which address HIV and other blood-borne infections using gender specific approaches for women IDUs incarcerated in Spanish prisons.

N2  - Between November 1993 and April 1994, our physicians' team interviewed and took blood samples of 631 prisoners randomly drawn from the largest prison of South America, which counted about 4700 inmates at that time. The interview consisted of questions related to risk behaviour for HIV infection, and the subjects were asked to provide blood for serological tests for HIV, hepatitis C and syphilis. Our main purpose was to investigate the relationship between HCV and injecting drug use as related to HIV seropositivity. Participation in the study was voluntary and confidentiality was guaranteed. Overall prevalences found were as follows: HIV: 16% (95% confidence interval (CI): 13-19%); HCV: 34% (95% CI: 30-38%), and syphilis: 18% (95% CI: 15-21%). Acknowledged use of ever injecting drug was 22% and no other parenteral risk was reported. Our results, as compared with other studies in the same prison, suggest that HIV prevalence has been stable in recent years, and that the major risk factor for HIV infection in this population is parenteral exposure by injecting drug use.

N2  - Objective: To determine prevalence of HIV infection and risk behaviors in commercial sex workers (CSWs), drug users, and prisoners in Sindh, Pakistan.
Methods: A medical clinic was established in a "red-light" district of Karachi. Eighty-one CSWs who registered at the clinic between November 1993 and June 1994 were provided HIV counseling and testing and administered a risk factor questionnaire. Next, 316 male drug users were tested for HIV-1 antibody from April to July 1994. Finally, a voluntary serosurvey of HIV-1 and HIV-2 and risk behaviors of 3525 prisoners in Sindh was conducted between July 1994 and December 1994. Abbott Recombinant HIV third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmatory testing with Western blot analysis were used in all three groups.
Results: None of 81 CSWs tested for HIV-1 antibody were positive. None of 316 drug users tested positive for HIV-1 antibody. Of 3441 male prisoners, 1 was HIV-I infected, and of 84 female prisoners, 1 was HIV-1 infected. No prisoner was positive for HIV-2 antibody.
Discussion: The prevalence of HIV in CSWs, drug users, and prisoners in Sindh is low at present. Intervention programs implemented at this stage can make an impact in HIV prevention.

N2  - This cross-sectional study was carried out in two Spanish prisons. A group of 177 HIV-infected prison inmates were interviewed. Standardized personal interviews using a structured questionnaire were conducted to assess sociodemographic features and prison setting characteristics, clinical variables, social support and drug consumption. A simplified four-item questionnaire for self-reported adherence was used. A total of 24.3% were non-adherent. Predictors of non-adherence in the multivariate analysis included poor or lack of ability to follow the prescribed treatment regimen, no visits in a month, anxious and/or depressed mood, difficulty in taking medication, receiving methadone treatment, cannabis consumption and robbery as the reason for imprisonment. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy was higher than in the wider community. However, other variables related to the correctional setting, such as assignments within the facility, adaptability of the prison system to authorize the cell being opened in the event of missed medication, or legal situation had no effect on adherence for inmates with HIV disease.

N2  - Although the interconnection between delinquency and substance use in adolescence is well documented, considerably less is known about substance-use initiation in childhood for juvenile delinquent populations. This descriptive study examined early substance initiation in childhood as reported by adolescents who were incarcerated for juvenile offenses (93 males, 96 females; 58% African American, 42% European American). Youth were individually interviewed using an adapted version of substance-related questions from the National Household Survey. Juvenile justice system records were reviewed to characterize offense histories. A majority of males and females reported using at least one substance (other than cigarettes) such as alcohol, marijuana, or inhalants by age 13. Alcohol use reportedly occurred by age 10 for 17% of the youth. For a substantial portion, early initiation turned into frequent early use. For example, 32% of the males and 39% of the females reported drinking alcoholic beverages at a frequency of several times per month or greater by age 13. Limited evidence related early substance initiation with subsequent substance abuse. Offense status was related to early substance initiation for females but not males. The study provided clear evidence that very early substance use is a significant problem among youth who end up in the juvenile justice system and that we need to find out more about the environmental and social variables affecting very early substance initiation.

Designing carceral environments that minimize the risk of interpersonal violence and maximize security is a recurring technological challenge. As one of the few commodities that prisoners cannot easily use directly as a weapon against guards or other prisoners, food is a powerful

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To develop and test the validity of a scale measuring therapeutic attitudes among prison staff working with drug misusers.
Design  A cross‐sectional postal questionnaire study using 27 statements with a five‐point Likert scale.
Setting  Four prisons in the south‐west of England
Participants  A total of 252 prison staff (response rate 70%), including 67 for test–retest (response rate 57%).
Findings  The study resulted in a three‐dimensional, nine‐item scale: the Prison Attitude to Drugs scale (PAD). The three subscales measure confidence in skills (four items), personal rewards (three items) and job satisfaction (two items). Test–retest correlations for the questions were above 0.7, with each factor having an internal coherence (coefficient alpha) of greater than 0.7.
Conclusions  The PAD is a reliable tool that can be used in the prison environment.

N2  - Despite the recent development of specialist services for Deaf mentally disordered offenders, there remains a paucity of research describing this unique population. The evidence base on which service delivery is provided is in its infancy and consequently relies on models and techniques validated within the hearing population. Deaf people have a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, and those who come into contact with forensic mental health services require a service which is suitable to their specific cultural and linguistic needs. Several papers have attempted to describe the characteristics, prevalence, offence taxonomy, and legal issues pertinent to Deaf mentally disordered offenders. This paper attempts to address two omissions in this literature. The first is to bring together a succinct account of what is currently known about Deaf offenders while emphasising what we consider to be the priorities for research in this area. The second is to provide a more detailed account of issues surrounding the assessment of Deaf mentally disordered offenders, as this underpins much of the work carried out with Deaf offenders (e.g., decisions regarding fitness to plead, diagnosis, formulation, intervention, and risk prediction). In doing this we hope to encourage greater synchrony in the research activity and development of Deaf forensic mental health services with the view to establishing an evidence base which is valid for the Deaf population.

N2  - The objective of the study was to examine the religious characteristics and background of inmates age 50 or over confined to a federal correctional institution. Ninety‐six of 106 eligible inmates (91%) consented and received complete evaluations. Forensic, demographic and health data were collected on all inmates, including detailed information on religious affiliation, background, belief, public and private activities, experience, intrinsic religiosity and religious coping. Over 80% of inmates were currently affiliated with a denomination different from the one in which they were raised, with a net movement from conservative Protestant to mainline traditions. Contrary to expectation, religious characteristics of older inmates were not greatly different from those of non‐incarcerated older adults. There was weak support for a relationship between religiousness and positive forensic factors (first prison term, fewer disciplinary actions). Religion was reported by 32% of inmates to be the most important factor that enabled them to cope. Inmates' intrinsic religiosity and perceived importance of religion to their primary caretaker (person who raised them) were both inversely related to depressive symptoms. This study suggests that religious background, belief, activities, experience and intrinsic religiosity are important factors to the adjustment and behavior of older prisoners.

N2  - The paper examines the service contact at 6-9-month follow-up of residents of seven probation service-approved premises with a dedicated specialist mental health service. The service is designed to assess, provide brief interventions, and promote appropriate linkage with mainstream mental health services upon discharge. Findings suggest that linkage with mainstream services was robust with a significant proportion in contact at time of follow-up. The high levels of non-psychotic mental health needs suggest services of this type may have an important role in ensuring the needs of mentally disordered offenders are appropriately met and that the engagement of primary care services is essential.

N2  - The present study identifies the correlates of current suicidal ideation and past suicide attempt among 555 adolescents in a county juvenile detention center. Suicidal behavior in delinquent boys was generally associated with depression and decreased social connection, whereas suicidal behavior in delinquent girls was associated with impulsivity and instability. Current ideation was most significantly associated with current depression. In multivariate analyses, past attempts were associated with suicidal ideation and ineffective coping for males, with major life events and impulsivity for females, and with not residing with at least one biological parent prior to detention for both males and females.

N2  - The study investigated the long-term effects of political imprisonment in the former German Democratic Republic. A group of non-treatment-seeking former political prisoners (n = 146) was compared with an age-and sex-matched group (n = 75). Assessments included the structured Diagnostic Interview for Psychiatric Disorders (German abbreviation: DIPS) for DSM-III-R/-IV diagnoses, a checklist of persecution and maltreatment: and other self-rated measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and dissociation. PTSD was assessed by the DIPS as current and lifetime diagnoses. Former political prisoners were imprisoned for 38 months on average. The former prisoners had a lower educational and lifetime occupational level than the comparison group. Results regarding diagnoses show a frequency of 30% current and 60% lifetime PTSD in the former prisoners group. Other anxiety disorders (e.g., claustrophobia, social phobia) outnumbered comorbid affective disorders. The level of dissociation was elevated in the former prisoners group. Intrusive recollections and hyperarousal were more common than avoidance/numbing symptoms. Despite differences in imprisonment duration between three historically defined eras of persecution, no differences appeared in the level of symptomatology. The results suggest that political imprisonment in the former German Democratic Republic had long-term psychological effects. Compared with an age-and sex-matched comparison group, the former political prisoners showed higher levels not only of post-traumatic symptomatology but also of other anxiety disorders and dissociation.

N2  - OBJECTIVES To study the effect of an intervention on prevention of respiratory arrest and cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and to characterize ward CPAs by preceding signs and symptoms and initial cardiac rhythm. DESIGN A before-and-after interventional trial (12 months preintervention and 12 months postintervention). SETTING A tertiary care, academic children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS Admitted patients who subsequently had either the code team or pediatric medical emergency team (PMET) called or who had a respiratory arrest or CPA on the wards. INTERVENTION Transition from a traditional code team to a PMET that responds to clinically deteriorating children in noncritical care areas. OUTCOME MEASURES Combined rate of respiratory arrests and CPAs, rate of CPAs, and rate of respiratory arrests on the wards and agreement between independent reviewers on categorization of CPAs. RESULTS There was no change in the rate of CPAs on the wards. However, there was a 73% decrease in the incidence of respiratory arrests (0.23 respiratory arrests/1000 patient-days pre-PMET vs 0.06 post-PMET, P = .03). There was 100% agreement between reviewers on categorization of CPAs. CONCLUSIONS Transition to a PMET was not associated with a change in CPAs but was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of ward respiratory arrests. We also describe children who may have benefited from the PMET but whose data were not captured by current outcome measures. Finally, we present a new method for categorization of ward CPAs based on preceding signs and symptoms and initial cardiac rhythm.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2008;162(2):117-122-->

N2  - Arboleda et al said that digital platforms obfuscate the power arrangements that undergird them in part by mimicking aspects of real life in their user interface. A Web page for answering questions becomes a forum, a group on Facebook becomes a community, all to make interaction with digital platforms seem frictionless. Carceral logics for interaction are embedded in the design of digital platforms, manifesting in reporting and deplatforming being the limited ways in which conflict is resolved within online communities. Community standards reinforce carcerality and mimic legal language to convey a false sense of legitimacy, without inputs from any "community." But while digital platforms might mimic these aspects of real life, they don't operate by the same rules. Digital platforms replicate carceral logics through surveillance and content moderation. Platforms craft content-moderation policies reflecting their business interests rather than those of the communities using their platforms. This top-down approach fails to address specific local contexts in which content is created.

N2  - Objectives: The purpose of the study was to conduct and evaluate an intensive AIDS education program for incarcerated male adolescent drug users.
Methods: The study was conducted in New York City's main jail facility for detained and sentenced male youths aged 16–19 years. A four-session, group-oriented AIDS education program based on Problem-Solving Therapy was conducted. The program was voluntary and all youths on designated dormitories were invited to participate. The evaluation compared youths participating in the AIDS education with waiting list controls who were discharged or transferred before they could be offered the education. Behavioral outcomes for AIDS education participants and controls were determined at a five month follow-up after release from jail. Behaviors were measured through personal interviews at baseline and follow-up.
Results: High rates of HIV risk behaviors were documented, including alcohol, marijuana and cocaine/crack use that may predispose youths to sexual risk-taking: practice of heterosexual anal sex; multiple and high-risk sexual partnerships; and no, or inconsistent, use of condoms. Education participants as compared with controls were significantly more likely to increase their condom use, to increase positive attitudes towards condoms, and possibly to decrease high-risk sexual partnerships. However, other sexual risk variables and substance use were unchanged.
Conclusion: Intensive AIDS education provided in jail can be useful in reducing certain HIV risk behaviors of criminally-involved male adolescents.

N2  - Background: The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) was developed in order to help quantify the parental contribution to psychological distress. It has subsequently been shown to be of value in examining the influence of parents in many diverse areas including delinquency. Method: A shortened form of the PBI and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scare (HADS) were administered to a group of young offenders held in custody in Scotland. Results. High levels of psychological distress were linked with low parental care, but there were no associations between psychological distress and parental control. However, an analysis of the factor structure found that, although the care factor of the PBI showed good internal reliability, the control factor was less well defined in this group. Conclusions: It is suggested that a three-factor solution representing care, control with regard to independence and protective control may be more appropriate.

N2  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine factors that predict condom self-efficacy among a sample of soon-to-be-released adult male inmates with respect to self-reported HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Approximately 230 inmates had agreed to enroll in the study. This analysis is based on completed baseline surveys from 187 inmates. Data were collected at baseline (prior to implementing the intervention) on self-reported condom self-efficacy HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Findings support that, requesting that your partner uses condoms every time they had sex was the strongest indicator of self-reported condom self-efficacy by inmates in the sample (p < 0.01). Findings also suggest that engaging in sexual activity after smoking marijuana, limiting the number of sex partners and asking partners' HIV status were significant predictors for the dependent variable of condom self-efficacy (p <.05); engaging in sexual activity after drinking was not (p < 0.11). Findings suggest that it may be wise to take a best-practice approach using former inmates as peer educators if health-based interventions are to be delivered to soon-to-be-released adult male inmates.

N2  - To identify incidence of antibody to hepatitis C virus among 265 male prison inmates, we assayed paired serum specimens obtained at intake in 1985-1986 with follow-up specimens in 1987. Intake prevalence was 38 percent. Seroincidence was 1.1/100 person years in prison. This finding might reflect saturation of high-risk subgroups or possibly reduced frequency of exposures following incarceration.

N2  - An interview study among a group of arrestees in seven county jails was conducted in the state of Ohio between June 1999 and September 2001, examining the prevalence of alcohol and drug dependence within the group and assessing the need for substance-abuse treatment. Four of the county jails where interviews were conducted are in urban areas, and three are in rural areas. The present study focused on demographic variables, situation-related factors, current drug dependence diagnoses, past treatment experience, and jail location-rural or urban. It sought to assess whether these factors predicted arrestees' perceived needs for substance-specific treatment (for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and/or opiate addiction); and, further, whether any predictors of a perceived need for treatment would be identical for arrestees housed in rural jails and those housed in urban jails. The results show that some of the factors assessed do exert differential effects on rural and urban arrestees' perceived needs for substance-specific treatment. Future treatment policy within the criminal justice system should perhaps take into account inmates' individual characteristics and the rural or urban location of the jail initiating their processing. It may be possible, by paying attention to these variables, to enhance inmates' motivation to enter treatment programs, leading ultimately to drug-use cessation.

N2  - The effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been well-established in community samples but its effectiveness in carceral settings is less clear. The present systematic review thus sought to evaluate the effects of psychological therapies for PTSD and depression in incarcerated samples. We searched five databases from inception through January 2023, for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two reviewers independently reviewed the study eligibility, extracted the data, assessed the intervention reporting, and evaluated the risk of bias. Eleven RCTs met inclusion criteria, five addressing treatment of PTSD, and six addressing treatment of depression. Interventions produced mixed findings with respect to symptom reduction relative to active controls, with a significant risk of methodological bias in virtually all studies. Of the interventions studied, interpersonal psychotherapy produced the most encouraging, though clearly still tentative results for the treatment of depression. Results highlight the need for increased methodological rigor and additional research to examine the effectiveness of interventions that have yielded positive results in community samples.

N2  - Aims. To examine the drug use and injection risk‐taking among incarcerated methadone maintenance (MM) patients; to determine the impact of a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) on prison‐based MM treatment; to compare incarcerated patients with community patients. Design. Structured interview. Settings. New South Wales (NSW) prisons and community methadone maintenance (MM) units. Participants. One hundred incarcerated MM patients and 183 community MM patients. Measurements. Subjects were interviewed about drug use and needle risk‐taking in the previous 6 months, and assessed for a diagnosis of ASPD. Findings. Heroin had been used by 38% of prison MM patients in the 6 months prior to interview, on a median of 4.5 days. Forty‐four per cent of prison patients had injected a drug in the preceding 6 months. A third (32%) of prison subjects had borrowed used injecting equipment within the preceding 6 months, and 35% had lent used injecting equipment to others. Community patients were more likely to have injected a drug in the preceding 6 months (84% vs. 44%), to have used heroin (72% vs. 38%) and to have done so more frequently (20 vs. 4.5 days). Prisoners, however, were more likely to have borrowed (32% vs. 15%) and lent (35% vs. 21%) injecting equipment in that time. While injecting at lower rates than their community counterparts, the injecting occasions of prisoners were of much higher levels of risk. A diagnosis of ASPD was unrelated to both drug use and needle risk‐taking. Conclusions. Incarcerated patients injected less frequently than community patients, but had higher levels of needle risk‐taking.

N2  - Many jail inmates have a history of substance use and "abuse"; few, however, receive comprehensive treatment for substance use disorders while in jail. The authors offer a longitudinal reanalysis of data from five jail-based substance user treatment programs. Survival analysis was used to identify client characteristics associated with length of time in treatment. Survival curves for the five programs were compared, indicating which ones retained inmates the longest. Results from a model stratified by jail site revealed that inmates over 25 years of age and those already sentenced had significantly longer treatment stays. The Substance Abuse Intervention Division (SAID) program, a modified therapeutic community in a New York jail, and the Deciding, Educating, Understanding, Counseling, and Evaluation (DEUCE) program, a curriculum-based intervention, had the longest survival curves and were, therefore, most effective at retaining inmates in treatment.

N2  - The current study assesses the psychological and psychiatric aftermath of war captivity; 164 Israeli ex-POWs and 189 comparable controls were assessed for posttraumatic stress disorder, intrusion and avoidance tendencies, and generalized psychiatric symptomatology 18 years after the war. Findings indicated that trauma-related psychopathology and general psychiatric symptomatology were more prevalent among POWs than among their matched controls. In addition, captivity experience, social support at homecoming, and, above all, sociodemographic and military factors were found to be strongly correlated with the outcome measures. Theoretical and clinical implications of the aftermath of captivity are discussed.

N2  - BACKGROUND This study examined longitudinal patterns of heroin use, other substance use, health, mental health, employment, criminal involvement, and mortality among heroin addicts. METHODS The sample was composed of 581 male heroin addicts admitted to the California Civil Addict Program (CAP) during the years 1962 through 1964; CAP was a compulsory drug treatment program for heroin-dependent criminal offenders. This 33-year follow-up study updates information previously obtained from admission records and 2 face-to-face interviews conducted in 1974-1975 and 1985-1986; in 1996-1997, at the latest follow-up, 284 were dead and 242 were interviewed. RESULTS In 1996-1997, the mean age of the 242 interviewed subjects was 57.4 years. Age, disability, years since first heroin use, and heavy alcohol use were significant correlates of mortality. Of the 242 interviewed subjects, 20.7% tested positive for heroin (with additional 9.5% urine refusal and 14.0% incarceration, for whom urinalyses were unavailable), 66.9% reported tobacco use, 22.1% were daily alcohol drinkers, and many reported illicit drug use (eg, past-year heroin use was 40.5%; marijuana, 35.5%; cocaine, 19.4%; crack, 10.3%; amphetamine, 11.6%). The group also reported high rates of health problems, mental health problems, and criminal justice system involvement. Long-term heroin abstinence was associated with less criminality, morbidity, psychological distress, and higher employment. CONCLUSIONS While the number of deaths increased steadily over time, heroin use patterns were remarkably stable for the group as a whole. For some, heroin addiction has been a lifelong condition associated with severe health and social consequences.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2001;58:503-508-->

N2  - The use of psychoactive substances by offenders is a major preoccupation among correctional network clinicians, researchers and administrators. However, very little is known about this phenomenon during incarceration. The research presented here explores patterns of inmate drug use during imprisonment. Selected at random, 317 respondents in 10 Canadian penitentiaries were interviewed in 1999 to complete self-reported questionnaires. The data indicate various types of important changes, notably with regard to substances used, frequency of use, motivations for use, and inmates' perception of their psychological state during periods of intoxication.

N2  - The proliferation of for-profit immigrant detention centers in rural and
suburban communities sets the stage for this chapter. Taking a feminist
geographic approach to discourses surrounding sites and cases in Texas, the
authors use discursive analysis and informant interviews to expose uneven
power relations, divergent discourses across actors, and disproportionate
impact present within an immigration landscape controlled through state
tactics of invisibility and dislocation.
This chapter discusses the proliferation of for-profit immigrant detention centers in rural and suburban community’s sets the stage. Only a few months after President Trump’s election, it was announced that a new immigrant detention facility, the first under the new administration, would soon be constructed in Conroe, Texas – a small city just north of Houston. Immigrant detention potentially generates different community responses and impacts than prison operation, given both the specific political discourses circulating on the topic of immigration, and detainees’ and their families’ impeded access to legal resources due to their precarious migratory status. Originally touted as a means of promoting local community development, the immigrant detention industry ultimately becomes a point of contention in Conroe, shielded from public critique because of its private development status. The chapter traces the debates circulating in online news and interviews related to the opacity of detention privatization and management in Conroe.

N2  - The accurate diagnosis and monitoring of HIV incident infections would facilitate: (i) directing prevention, testing, and counselling resources to populations at greatest risk of new infections; (ii) tracing of contacts of individuals identified with early HIV infection; and (iii) prioritizing prophylactic and therapeutic antiretroviral agents to persons at early stages of HIV infection. A recently developed protocol for identifying persons with early HIV infection offers a novel laboratory strategy for detecting recently infected persons and estimating HIV incidence rates in different communities and risk groups. This method identifies individuals with recent HIV infections by further testing of seropositive samples using a modified less sensitive (LS) version of an anti-HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA), which delays the detection of seroconversion by 129 days (CI: 109- 149 days) relative to standard test methods. Individuals who are positive using the standard EIA and confirmatory test methods but negative on the LS-EIA represent recent HIV infections. HIV incidence rates can be estimated from the rate of detection of such persons in the sample population.

N2  - Tuberculosis remains the world's leading cause of death from infectious disease. The factors associated with infection, including overcrowding, concurrent infection with HIV, immigration from high-incidence countries, and intravenous drug abuse, are well represented in prisons, yet the disease among the prison population has not received very much attention. Argues that it should be generating more public and professional alarm, and makes some recommendations for action by prison authorities.

N2  - Policing systems function to corral and control bodies associated with moral pollution. In the contemporary period, disproportionate surveillance occurs in racially and class-segregated communities, with sophisticated technologies bolstered by the War on Drugs. Indeed, present-day policing practices, incarceration in jails and prisons, and post-reentry barriers operate as the primary social instruments for containing bodies associated with moral pollution. Today, there are 2.3 million people in US prisons—nearly half of whom are Black—and little recognition of the devastation wrought by drug task forces and sophisticated policing systems, mandatory minimum sentences and other harsh crime laws, the expansion of carceral

N2  - Objective:We wanted to study the prevalence and characteristics of dangerousness among female psychiatric patients.
Method:A national survey was performed in Norway, covering all psychiatric in‐ and out‐patient units.
Results:There were 329 persons reported to have a psychiatric disorder and to satisfy our criteria for dangerousness, giving a total prevalence of 9.9/100 000 adults. There were 54 women, giving a female prevalence of 3.1/100 000. When compared to a matched sample of the men, fewer women were out‐patients or had had jail sentences. We found no sex differences with regard to frequencies of psychosis, mental retardation, personality disorders, or drug or alcohol abuse. The women had an increased frequency of suicide‐related and self‐injurious behaviours and previous commitment for arson.
Conclusion:The prevalence of women with psychiatric disorders who are considered to be dangerous was 3.1/100 000. The dangerous men did not show higher frequencies than the women for psychopathology, drug abuse, behaviour or criminality.

N2  - BACKGROUND Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections have emerged among patients without health care–associated risk factors. Understanding the epidemiology of CA-MRSA is critical for developing control measures. METHODS At a 464-bed public hospital in Chicago and its more than 100 associated clinics, surveillance of soft tissue, abscess fluid, joint fluid, and bone cultures for S aureus was performed. We estimated rates of infection and geographic and other risks for CA-MRSA through laboratory-based surveillance and a case-control study. RESULTS The incidence of CA-MRSA skin and soft tissue infections increased from 24.0 cases per 100 000 people in 2000 to 164.2 cases per 100 000 people in 2005 (relative risk, 6.84 [2005 vs 2000]). Risk factors were incarceration (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-3.67), African American race/ethnicity (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.28-2.87), and residence at a group of geographically proximate public housing complexes (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.25-4.98); older age was inversely related (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96 [for each decade increase]). Of 73 strains tested, 79% were pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type USA300. CONCLUSIONS Clonal CA-MRSA infection has emerged among Chicago's urban poor. It has occurred in addition to, not in place of, methicillin-susceptible S aureus infection. Epidemiological analysis suggests that control measures could focus initially on core groups that have contributed disproportionately to risk, although CA-MRSA becomes endemic as it disseminates within communities.Arch Intern Med. 2007;167:1026-1033-->

N2  - What makes the study of French relevant to students in prison? This chapter focuses on a pedagogical approach to French instruction that aims to deepen an understanding of self and of cultures through creativity and curiosity, skills that extend beyond preparing to be a tourist or ordering French food with a certain accent. In terms of course design, this chapter explores the problematic aspects of typical language textbooks, given the emphasis on personal information and preferences. It also illustrates how the lack of technology shifted the class environment and shaped homework assignments. Based on a qualitative review of teaching the class, Ramsey discusses the unexpected hurdles encountered, such as the students' fear of making mistakes, an essential and inevitable part of language acquisition. By responding with humor, an awareness of physical and emotional needs, and transparent expectations, the class became a nurturing space for students to explore and create through a new language. This approach, which aims to be trauma-informed and productive for language acquisition, offers insights for both "inside" and "outside" teaching.

N2  - Incarcerated youth are at high risk for HIV infection due to the high prevalence of injecting drug use, trading sex for money or drugs, unprotected sex, and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Incarcerated youth represent a particularly vulnerable population because they are more prone to be runaway youth, homeless, and from impoverished families. Assessing trends in HIV seroprevalence among incarcerated youth is important because HIV infection among adolescents is likely to be recently acquired. Trends in HIV seroprevalence data may therefore help in prioritizing prevention and health services for this population.

N2  - An interview study of 81 former political prisoners investigated whether posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is related to the way individuals process the prison experience. In contrast to participants without PTSD, those with chronic or remitted PTSD were more likely to perceive mental defeat and an overall feeling of alienation from other people. Chronic PTSD was also related to perceived negative and permanent change in their personalities or life aspirations. The groups did not differ in their attempts to gain control during imprisonment. Evidence for a relationship between political commitment and PTSD was mixed. The results suggest that mental defeat, alienation, and permanent change are related to PTSD after interpersonal trauma and may need to be addressed in treatment.

N2  - The topic of foreign body ingestion has received extensive coverage in the areas of surgery, emergency medicine, and pediatrics. A subset of this topic, the intentional ingestion of foreign bodies, however, is much less common, and requires special evaluation and management. Here, we report a case of ingestion of a rolled, metal tuna can lid in a male prison inmate previously diagnosed with depression and paranoid schizophrenia. Following evaluation by the surgical team, the foreign body was removed by laparotomy and the patient was discharged back to the prison without complication. In many cases, ingestions of this type involve a command hallucination ordering the patient to swallow the foreign body. Interestingly, the patient in the present case reported auditory hallucinations commanding him not to swallow the can lid. On further investigation, we found that patient had a proclivity toward this swallowing behavior even prior to his incarceration. Early identification of inmates with this proclivity has important implications for treatment and prevention.

N2  - Abstract Objectives: To document the existence of drug resistance in a tuberculosis treatment programme that adheres strictly to the DOTS principles (directly observed treatment, short course) and to determine the extent of drug resistance in a prison setting in one of the republics of the former Soviet Union. Design: Case study. Setting: Central Penitentiary Hospital in Baku, the referral centre for tuberculosis patients from all prisons in Azerbaijan. Subjects: Prisoners with tuberculosis: 28 selected patients not responding clinically or bacteriologically to the standard treatment (group 1) and 38 consecutive patients at admission to the programme (group 2). Main outcome measures: Drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains grown from sputum. Results: All the non-responding patients (group 1) had strains resistant to at least one drug. 25 (89%) of the non-responding patients and nine (24%) of the consecutive patients had M tuberculosis strains resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid. A further 17 patients in group 2 had strains resistant to one or more first line drugs. Conclusions: Drug resistant M tuberculosis strains are common in prisons in Azerbaijan. Tuberculosis problems tend to be worse in prisons, but prisoners and former prisoners may have an important role in the transmission of tuberculosis, particularly of drug resistant forms, in the community. National programmes to control tuberculosis will have to take into account and address the problems in prisons to ensure their success. Key messages Tuberculosis is an important problem in prisons in Azerbaijan Multidrug resistant tuberculosis was common and an important cause of non-response to standard treatment National tuberculosis control programmes must include prisons and take account of drug resistance Unless WHO recommended treatment protocols are followed the problem of multidrug resistant tuberculosis may result in untreatable tuberculosis which will spread to the general community

N2  - Background: In April 2003 a Court of Appeal judgement (R v Ashworth Hospital Authority ex p B [2003]) ruled that it is unlawful to treat a patient compulsorily and against his will, unless it is for the mental disorder which he is classified to be suffering from under the Mental Health Act, 1983.
Aim: To determine the proportion of patients receiving treatment for an unclassified mental disorder in a large psychiatric hospital.
Method: A cross-sectional survey of detained general and forensic psychiatric inpatients was undertaken. Interviews were conducted with the responsible medical officers (RMOs) of a random sample of 60 patients detained under the single legal categories of: mental illness (N = 20), psychopathic disorder (N = 20) and mental impairment or severe mental impairment (N = 20).
Results: A total of 228 patients were surveyed, of whom 188 (82%) were detained under a single legal category. In the sample of 60 patients, 10 were found to be receiving treatment for an unclassified disorder (0/20 of those with mental illness, 6/20 with psychopathic disorder and 4/20 with mental impairment or severe mental impairment). Based on these proportions, an estimated 16/228 (7%) patients were receiving treatment for an unclassified disorder). Five were restricted patients, and therefore required a mental health review tribunal (MHRT) to effect reclassification. For two patients the unclassified disorder did not meet the statutory criteria. In all 10 cases the RMO considered that if treatment for the unclassified disorder were stopped there would be a serious deterioration in the patient's mental health. In light of the judgement, patients receiving treatment for unclassified disorder are now being reclassified where appropriate.
Conclusions: The judgement has significant practical implications for patients, RMOs, and MHRTs. Nationally, a large number of patients are likely to require reclassification. Some will challenge that reclassification. As a result, the workload of RMOs and MHRTs will increase. Difficulties will arise where a patient refuses treatment for an unclassified disorder and cannot be reclassified. Restricted patients pose particular difficulties, as they can only be reclassified by an MHRT.

N2  - The Freedom & Captivity Curriculum Project designed curricula for college courses, discussion groups, and community classes taught by incarcerated people. Hosted by Colby College and supported by an American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) "Sustaining Public Engagement Grant," we explored restorative justice, transformative justice, and abolitionist practices for Maine's future, including podcasts, exhibitions, performances, film and photography, workshops, presentations, and didactic materials. In 2022, while still incarcerated, Linda Small joined the Freedom & Captivity Curriculum Project team to write a curriculum, facilitate a pilot class, develop a facilitator guidebook, and train facilitators. This first-of-its-kind project will be uploaded onto technology used inside Maine's prisons. The following narrative reveals Linda's experience in developing and facilitating the curriculum, learning about restorative practices in the wake of harm, and embracing the unexpected intimacy of her team and pilot class participants.

N2  - Despite laws in the United States enacted to protect individuals with disabilities in prison, there is ample case law to demonstrate that the intent of these laws has not been achieved. Using the existing US legal and social science literatures and experiences, this article considers: the problems hearing-impaired offenders face in prison that are not encountered by non-deaf or hard of hearing inmates; the services and accommodations prisons provide for deaf or hard of hearing inmates so that they can function at least as well as non-deaf or hard of hearing inmates; and the types of scientific research that should be conducted to understand the possible types of deaf or hard of hearing experiences in prisons, the consequences of these experiences, and the best way to address pathological sequela of being deaf or hard of hearing in prison. We argue that the creation of rules to protect this population is of no value unless these laws are implemented as intended. Without monitoring the law in action and studying why the intent of the law may be thwarted, an atmosphere in which deaf or hard of hearing offenders are neglected and even abused will likely occur.

N2  - The primary aim of this study was to examine factors related to anal sex practices and sexual risk-taking among a sample of soon-to-be-released adult male inmates with respect to self-reported HIV/AIDS risk behaviours. This study focused on collecting data from adult male inmates during the period from 2000 to 2003. Baseline level data were collected by project staff after a pool of eligible participants was selected by Department of Corrections personnel. Inmates had to be 18 years of age or older, male, and sexually active. Findings suggest that inmates did not vary much with respect to feeling that they would be less likely to take precautions before having sex after using marijuana. Inmates who reported having anal sex were more likely to indicate that they felt they were better lovers while under the influences of marijuana. Those with a history of anal sex also reported being more likely to do things sexually under the influence of marijuana than they would if they were sober (P < 0.03).

N2  - The intergenerational transmission of violence and the tendency for abused and neglected children to become abusers, delinquents, and violent offenders in their adult life is an important field to be understood. It is also important to understand these backgrounds to guide future preventative interventions. Through a cross-sectional study, the occurence of abuse during childhood and adolescence of adult women incarcerated in a female state prison at Recife in northeast Brazil was investigated. Among 219 prisoners, 190 accepted to join the research; 149 were young women (23–27 years) with severe educational deficiency. Living in poor socioeconomical conditions with problematic and violent familiar relations, 116 (61 per cent) left home at the end of their adolescence and the same number reported having been abused (p < 0.000015). There was a statistical significance between the abuses suffered and witnessed by the subjects and the perpetration of abuse against children and adolescents by themselves (p < 0.0022 and p < 0.0000049). Parents were the most frequent perpetrators (37.4 per cent). Sexual activity and use of legal and illegal drugs occurred early in adolescence. The group also had a family history of violence. Based on the analysed data of this studied group, the authors assumed that the abuse suffered in childhood and adolescence of these women drove them to be abusers in adult life and could have been a predictive marker for their conduct disorders and subsequent criminal behavior.

N2  - A report published on Feb 18, 2003, by Anne Owers, the chief inspecfor of prisons, into Holloway prison in north London, UK, referred to the regime as "grossly inadequate". In response, the Youth Justice Board has said it will remove all young girls from prisons in England and Wales by the end of this year and place them in specialist units outside the prison service. Hundreds of inmates are also to be removed from Ashfield, Britain's first privately run young offenders' institution, after it was condemned earlier this month as the worst prison in the country by Martin Narey, director general of the Prison Service for England and Wales.

N2  - Suicide prevention in custody is hampered by the lack of funds and professional staff. In order to evaluate the prison suicide phenomenon, a study was conducted evaluating all suicides that occurred in Austrian prisons between 1975 and 1997 (n = 220). In addition to evaluating the number of male versus female suicides, the preferred suicide methods were studied, as well as suicide risk of different circumstances of custody. Suicide rates of distinguishable, important subgroups of prisoners were calculated. The suicide rate for prisoners on remand was 236.0 per 100,000, and for offenders classified as mentally ill it was 205.4 per 100,000. That is about 8 times higher than the suicide rate in Austria's general population (1975–1997: 24.6 per 100,000). The suicide rate for sentenced offenders was 81.3 per 100,000, about twice the suicide rate in Austria's general male population. We recommend that psychologists or psychiatrists concentrate on the suicide prevention of high‐risk offenders after screening the newly admitted offenders for their propensity to suicide.

N2  - An RT‐PCR assay using primers from the 5′‐UTR of the GBV‐C/HGV genome was used to detect viremia, and a serological assay was used to detect past exposure to GBV‐C/HGV, in sera from 106 imprisoned Greek intravenous drug users. High seroprevalence rates indicative of the parenteral route of transmission of the virus were found (32.1% for GBV‐C RNA and 46.2% for anti‐GBV‐C E2). These rates were nonetheless lower in comparison to the corresponding rates of HCV infection markers (64.2% for HCV RNA and 77.4% for anti‐HCV). Statistically significant univariate associations were observed between GBV‐C‐RNA positivity and younger age (P = 0.006) and HCV‐RNA positivity (P = 0.024), as well as with higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels (P < 0.001); this latter association was shown to be independent of coinfection with HCV and of age by a multiple logistic regression model. Apparently, GBV‐C/HGV had spread readily by needle‐sharing in prison, while causing acute subclinical hepatitis in infected inmates. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial 5′‐UTR of the GBV‐C/HGV genome from 16 seropositive individuals, which delineated their grouping within genotype 2, also revealed a close genetic relationship between two sets of sequences from 4 drug addicts, 3 of whom admitted to sharing needles while imprisoned.

N2  - SUMMARY
Aims  To assess by a survey the management of prisoners with diabetes treated with insulin in French prisons.
Methods  A questionnaire was sent to the head of healthcare services for prisoners of every French prison. Information was obtained on prevalence of insulin‐treated diabetes prisoners and diabetes care in prison. The number of episides of ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia needing hospital admissions were evaluated during the past year.
Results  Among the 163 questionnaires sent, 115 were returned, giving an overall response rate of 69%. At the time of the study the prison population was 38 175 people. One hundred and sixty‐nine prisoners were treated by insulin (0.4%). Self‐monitoring of blood glucose was available only for 94 (55.6%) insulin‐treated prisoners. A total of 130 (76.9%) prisoners performed two insulin injections daily or less, 105 (62.1%) prisoners were not allowed to keep their insulin delivery systems with them. Of the prisoners who treated themselves, 14 (12.1%) used syringes and 42 (36.5%) used pen devices. Ninety‐two (55.1%) prisoners had had access to a diabetes specialist during the previous year. Diabetic diets were available in only 65 (60.7%) prisons. From June 1998 to June 1999, there were 20 hospital admissions for a diabetic ketoacidosis and 14 for hypoglycaemia.
Conclusions  This study shows that prison decreases the autonomy of diabetic prisoners who often cannot self‐inject or test their blood. Access to visiting consultant diabetologists and specialist nurses to educate both prisoners with diabetes and prison staff could improve diabetic care.

N2  - Fifty subjects with a history of traumatic brain injury TBI and or substance use, completed neuro psychological measures of short and long term verbal and visual memory, information processing, motor speed and co ordination, executive functioning, and malingering. All subjects performed below norms on tests of verbal memory and verbal abstract thinking, but overall no differences were found due to either severity of TBI or level of substance use. Maori subjects obtained the lowest scores on tests of verbal ability, but also reported higher rates of TBI and substance use, which is presumed to account for this result. In conclusion, prison populations seem to have disproportionately high rates of TBI, recurrent TBI, and substance use, compared to the general population. Further, there are a group of individuals who have experienced both TBI and substance abuse, with associated impairments in verbal memory and learning, abstract thinking, and who report problems with general memory and socialization. These difficulties may affect functioning both in prison and following release.

N2  - The primary purpose of this study was to determine associations between measures of prior incarceration and marijuana use with self-reported HIV AIDS risk behaviors among a sample of soon-to-be-released adult male inmates. Analyses presented exclusively involve calculating two multiple logistic regression models to test the study hypothesis. The general model specified self-reported marijuana use as an outcome with selected demographic variables including ethnicity, age, education, and income prior to incarceration as predictor variables. Significant bivariate associations were recorded for age, education, and sexual self-expectation with respect to reincarceration. Specifically, the least amount of education reported, the more likely study participants were to have been incarcerated more than once.

N2  - "Capture land" is a Jamaican colloquialism for land occupied against the wishes, or without the knowledge of, the landowner. The term emerged in the 1970s to describe a pattern of expropriation by the people, coinciding with the height of the postcolonial state's anti-imperialism. Supported by ethnographic data, the chapter looks back from the present to locate capture land in the plantation's afterlives. By tracing a history of the present, the chapter puts capture land into relation with multiple material and epistemological threads of anticolonial land claims that oppose the monopolization of land as property. In the present, anti-squatting policy enacts a processual land grab that is rationalized by implicating the squatter as symptom and catalyst of national crises. Ultimately the chapter aims to unsettle how current policy discursively severs the postcolonial land question from legacies of genocide, land theft, enslavement, and exploitation, and in so doing, naturalizes dispossession.

Transmission to surrounding communities is frequently a matter of concern, although quantitative assessments of the risk in the community are rarely available. In 1986, 10 cases of meningococcal disease due to serogroup C organisms occurred among inmates of the Los Angeles County, California, Men's Jail System.

The outbreak in the jails preceded a sharp increase in the incidence of meningococcal disease among county residents, which returned to normal levels over a three-year period.

Between January 1 and March 31, 1993, meningococcal disease developed in 54 persons living . . .

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and usefulness of rapid screening and immediate presumptive treatment for sexually transmitted diseases among arrestees at a county jail. METHODS: The rapid plasma reagin test (for syphilis) and the urine leukocyte esterase test (for urethritis) were used in establishing routine screening and presumptive treatment for sexually transmitted diseases among arrestees. RESULTS: Of 4757 arrestees screened, 82 (1.7%) had untreated syphilis, and, of 4174 male arrestees screened, 541 (13%) had a positive leukocyte esterase test. The syphilis prevalence rate was higher among women than among men (3.1% vs 1.5%), and the rate was higher among Blacks than among Whites (2.3% vs 0.7%). Although leukocyte esterase test positivity was higher among persons reporting a urethral discharge (57% vs 12%), 88% of persons with a positive test result did not report such symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The program described here has reached persons with sexually transmitted diseases who are unlikely to use traditional health care services and thus are likely to remain untreated. Rapid screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases among arrestees is feasible and should be considered in areas with high sexually transmitted disease rates.

N2  - Background: Female prison inmates are underscreened and are at higher risk of cervical cancer. The impact of a nurse-led Pap screening intervention was examined, which included information sessions and Pap testing clinics. Method: Pap screening rates for 650 inmates at the Burnaby Correctional Centre for Women were compared both before and during the 20-week intervention period. These rates were determined by record linkage of Correction Branch inmate records and Cervical Cancer Screening Program patient records. Associations between socio-demographic factors and Pap screening rates were also examined. Results: A higher proportion of inmates was screened during the intervention period (26.9%) than during the preintervention period (21.0%) (although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06)). Very short-stay inmates were less frequently screened in the preceding two years before the intervention. Inmates with no high school education and longer lengths of incarceration were significantly more likely to receive Pap testing during the intervention period as compared to the preintervention period. Conclusion: The nurse-led intervention resulted in a modest improvement in the proportion of inmates receiving Pap screening. Unfortunately, the benefit of the nurse clinician did not reach, to a greater extent, inmates who had not been previously screened or who were inadequately screened. There is need for further work to target this hardestto-reach group. Contexte : Les femmes détenues, insuffisamment examinées, sont plus vulnérables au cancer du col utérin. Nous avons analysé l'incidence d'une intervention de dépistage par test de Papanicolaou effectuée par une infirmière, qui comprenait des séances d'information et des cliniques d'échantillonnage pour le test de Papanicolaou. Méthode : Nous avons comparé les taux de dépistage par test de Papanicolaou chez 650 détenues du Centre correctionnel pour femmes de Burnaby avant et durant la période d'intervention de 20 semaines. Ces taux ont été déterminés en couplant les dossiers du Bureau des affaires correctionnelles sur les détenues et les dossiers des patientes du Programme de dépistage du cancer du col de l'utérus. Nous avons également analysé les associations entre les facteurs sociodémographiques et les taux de dépistage par test de Papanicolaou. Résultats : La proportion de détenues examinées était plus élevée durant la période d'intervention (26,9 %) qu'avant l'intervention (21,0 %) (bien que cette différence ne soit pas significative : p=0,06). Les femmes détenues pendant un séjour de très courte durée avaient été examinées moins fréquemment au cours des deux années précédant l'intervention. Les détenues qui n'avaient pas terminé leurs études secondaires et celles incarcérées sur une plus longue période avaient de manière significative plus de chances de subir un test de Papanicolaou durant la période d'intervention qu'avant la période d'intervention. Conclusion : L'intervention effectuée par une infirmière a donné lieu à une modeste amélioration de la proportion des détenues ayant subi un dépistage par test de Papanicolaou. Malheureusement, l'avantage de l'accès à une infirmière clinicienne ne s'étendait pas, le plus souvent, aux détenues non examinées ou insuffisamment examinées antérieurement. Il faudrait déployer plus d'efforts pour cibler le groupe des détenues le plus difficile à atteindre.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To estimate 6-month prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders among juvenile detainees by demographic subgroups (sex, race/ethnicity, and age). DESIGN Epidemiologic study of juvenile detainees. Master's level clinical research interviewers administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version 2.3 to randomly selected detainees. SETTING A large temporary detention center for juveniles in Cook County, Illinois (which includes Chicago and surrounding suburbs). PARTICIPANTS Randomly selected, stratified sample of 1829 African American, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic youth (1172 males, 657 females, aged 10-18 years) arrested and newly detained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. RESULTS Significantly more females (56.5%) than males (45.9%) met criteria for 2 or more of the following disorders: major depressive, dysthymic, manic, psychotic, panic, separation anxiety, overanxious, generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, conduct, oppositional defiant, alcohol, marijuana, and other substance; 17.3% of females and 20.4% of males had only one disorder. We also examined types of disorder: affective, anxiety, substance use, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity or behavioral. The odds of having comorbid disorders were higher than expected by chance for most demographic subgroups, except when base rates of disorders were already high or when cell sizes were small. Nearly 14% of females and 11% of males had both a major mental disorder (psychosis, manic episode, or major depressive episode) and a substance use disorder. Compared with participants with no major mental disorder (the residual category), those with a major mental disorder had significantly greater odds(1.8-4.1) of having substance use disorders. Nearly 30% of females and more than 20% of males with substance use disorders had major mental disorders. Rates of some types of comorbidity were higher among non-Hispanic whites and older adolescents. CONCLUSIONS Comorbid psychiatric disorders are a major health problem among detained youth. We recommend directions for research and discuss how to improve treatment and reduce health disparities in the juvenile justice and mental health systems.Arch Gen Psychiarty. 2003;60:1097-1108-->

N2  - A cross-sectional study was conducted in prisons of Cantabria (northern Spain) from June
1992 to December 1994. Inmates were asked to participate in a survey on prevalence and risk
factors for monoinfections and coinfections with HIV, HBV and HCV. Crude and multiple
odds ratios of risk factors were calculated (by polychotomous logistic regression). Prevalence of
coinfections was higher than that of monoinfections. IDU risk factors were the main
independent variables associated with monoinfections and coinfections with these agents. The
strength of association increased with the degree of coinfection for IDU risk factors and penal
status, e.g. duration of injecting drug use for more than 5 years yielded an adjusted OR
ranging from 1·3 (95% CI: 0·4–5·1) for HBV monoinfection to 180 (95% CI: 61·0–540·0) for
HIV–HBV–HCV coinfection. In comparison, sexual behaviours were less important than IDU
risk factors.

N2  - Objective: This study was designed to describe the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) among inmates in the Georgia state prison system; to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB case detection methods used; to evaluate the use of contact tracing for inmate TB cases; and to determine rates of completion of therapy. Methods: Using a standardized form, the authors abstracted data from reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prison hospital medical charts, and county health department records for all patients with TB treated in the Georgia Department of Corrections prison system from 1991 through 1995. Results: A total of 142 cases of tuberculosis were treated in the prison during the five-year period. Approximately two-thirds were detected by active case finding, either at the county jail prior to transfer to the prison system (31%) or at the prison intake evaluation (37%). Routine screening procedures at entry, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, had a sensitivity of 96%. Contact investigations were carried out in county jails or in the community for only 25% of cases detected at entry to prison. For those released from prison still on treatment, 38% were lost to follow-up before completion of therapy. Conclusions: The Georgia prison system is doing an effective job of TB case detection and treatment among incarcerated inmates. Closer cooperation between the prison system and local health departments is needed to improve contact tracing and completion of therapy for this high risk population. Some cases detected at entry to prison appear to have been missed in the county jails.

N2  - This position paper, a joint statement of three health care organizations, assesses the impact of the National Drug Control Strategy on inmate populations and their health care needs. An overview of the current state of correctional health care is presented, and the prevalent health problems of inmates are reviewed. These problems include the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, substance abuse, mental disorders, and distinct problems of female inmates. The organizations conclude that the increase in correctional populations and their attendant health problems have overwhelmed the criminal justice systems' capacity to house and care for its inmates, and they call for a reconsideration of the National Drug Control Strategy, closer links between correctional health care and public health, and more proactive systems of correctional care that emphasize screening and prevention.

N2  - This study looked at inmates' self-reported data on prior treatment for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS risk among a sample of inmates in a medium security prison. Contingency tables were used and risk ratios were computed to provide an estimate of relative risk for inmates with a history of being treated for TB in opposition to inmates without a history of being treated for TB. Findings suggest that inmates who reported being treated for TB were more likely to have had sex with a man while in prison and to report that, while in prison, they had a main sex partner. They were also 1.15 times more likely to have had sex with a person from the transgender community while in prison and 2.53 times more likely to report having been forced to have sex while in prison than those without a past history of being treated for TB. Future studies should attempt to determine the extent to which having an infectious disease such as TB impacts behavioural change with respect to behaviours practised by inmates.

N2  - The present study examined differences in the amount and severity of spousal violence and posttraumatic stress symptoms between incarcerated battered women who killed/seriously assaulted their abusers and battered women incarcerated for other offenses. Additionally, several risk and buffering variables suggested by trauma research were tested to determine their ability to predict present posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology. Findings revealed that battered women who killed/seriously assaulted their batterers experienced more frequent and severe spousal abuse than those in the comparison group. No significant group differences were found for present PTSD symptom levels. Predictors of present PTSD symptomatology included: childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, past PTSD symptomatology, length of time elapsed since living with partner and receiving counseling in prison. The implications of the findings are discussed.

N2  - The International Committee of the Red Cross investigated an outbreak of beri-beri in a prison in West Africa. Twenty-five prisoners out of a total of 1020 died over a period of 11 weeks — exceeding the crude mortality rate of 1/10 000/day, a threshold for serious concern. Two hundred and eleven prisoners had clinical signs of beri-beri. An immediate response to treatment with thiamine was seen and no further deaths occurred. The triad of a positive squatting test, oedema and a diet consisting exclusively of white rice should lead to the diagnosis of beri-beri. The disease is more common than generally assumed, also in Africa and especially in prisons.

N2  - Yufit and Bongar (1992) argued that a deficiency in coping skills is an important risk factor for suicidal behavior. Dear, Thomson, Hall, and Howells (1998) found that prisoners who had self‐harmed in the past 3 days were less likely than a comparison group to have used problem‐solving or active cognitive coping strategies to handle the most significant stressor of the past week, but it was not clear whether this represented a difference in the quality of coping responses used. In this study, three groups of blind raters (prisoners, prison officers, and forensic psychologists) rated the coping responses of the participants in Dear et al.'s study. The coping responses of self‐harmers were judged less beneficial and more risky. Problem‐solving strategies were most often cited as contributing to beneficial outcomes and the catharsis strategies employed by self‐harmers were most often judged to be counterproductive. It remains unclear whether prisoners who self‐harmed routinely employ poor quality coping strategies or if they simply used poor quality coping on this occasion.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined whether incarceration during pregnancy is associated with infant birthweight. METHODS: Multivariable analyses compared infant birthweight outcomes among three groups of women: 168 women incarcerated during pregnancy, 630 women incarcerated at a time other than during pregnancy, and 3910 women never incarcerated. RESULTS: After confounders were controlled for, infant birthweights among women incarcerated during pregnancy were not significantly different from women never incarcerated; however, infant birthweights were significantly worse among women incarcerated at a time other than during pregnancy than among never-incarcerated women and women incarcerated during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Certain aspects of the prison environment (shelter, food, etc.) may be health-promoting for high-risk pregnant women.

N2  - "Correctional Health Care: Implications for Public Health Policy" is the first in a series of articles that examines the special health care needs of persons who are incarcerated in America's correctional facilities. The intent of the series is to gain a better understanding about the unmet health needs of incarcerated persons, the importance of addressing the health service delivery system in correctional facilities, and the implications that may arise from neglecting to address these health Issues on health outcomes for individual detainees and society at-large when detainees transition back into the community.
This article provides a descriptive overview of the corrections population, their socio-demographics, health care needs, and health concerns that are in need of improvement. This article also offers recommendations for public policy consideration to improve the overall health of inmates and society at large.

N2  - In the planning of a system of new regional jails in West Virginia, a general lack of trip generation data for correctional facilities was noted. Consequently, five regional jails and one federal correctional facility in West Virginia were studied. First, trip rates were calculated exclusively for the regional jails. Since the regional jails were a homogenous grouping of correctional facilities with respect to facility type and size, the trip rates calculated for the regional jails are believed to be reliable. Second, the regional jail data were synthesized with data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers and the federal correctional facility in West Virginia. These facilities were not homogenous with respect to size or facility type. It was determined that both the facility type (i.e., prisons versus jails) and size have a significant impact on the trip rate. Trip rates were calculated for the more generalized grouping of "correctional facilities" based on the synthesized database. However, users are cautioned to adjust the trip rates to reflect actual conditions with respect to facility type, size, and visitation policy.

N2  - The UK Government launched its private finance initiative (PFI) in 1992 to improve procurement of public sector projects. But the complexities of putting design, build, finance and operate contracts out to tender have meant that very few PFI schemes have actually got off the ground. Indeed, the initiative has been described by the chairman of one major construction company as the 'last chance saloon, where the bar is rarely open and the drinks are too expensive when it is'. This paper reviews the progress of the PFI to date and concludes that greater flexibility is needed to get it up and running. Only then will imaginative ideas-and the money to support them-really begin to flow.

N2  - For many years, clinicians, especially those working in rehabilitation centers for alcohol and drug users, have been preoccupied with clients presenting with dual diagnosis: substance abuse and legal problems. Comparative analyses of three groups of addicted men, 553 offenders and 499 nonoffenders in treatment for addiction problems and 103 addicted inmates were made to ascertain the biopsychosocial profile of these persons. Results showed that dual-diagnosis clients experienced more severe biopsychosocial problems than the nonoffending group of subjects. Offenders in prison experienced more social maladjustment than offenders in drug addiction treatment, they were less preoccupied by their drug consumption, and less motivated to change. Implications for treatment are discussed.

N2  - Although prison populations remain predominantly young, the number of older inmates in state and federal correctional facilities has been increasing. This report describes the results of a health survey of 119 male inmates 50 years of age and older residing in Iowa state correctional facilities. Subject's disease history included hypertension (40%), myocardial infarction (19%), and emphysema (18%). Most participants (97%) had missing teeth, 42% had gross physical functional impairments, and 70% smoked cigarettes. These findings have implications for health care provision and release planning.

N2  - This chapter highlights some of the governmental trends that go beyond the specificities of prison regimes. The state of the art of differentiation is described, with both old and new techniques geared towards maintaining order and the pervasiveness of control. I describe how, starting with the dismantling of prison football fields, the determination to organise spaces and social relations on a governmental level can be observed. I demonstrate how the large fields on which new pavilions were built have been replaced by smaller, more controllable pitches, leaving less and less room for crowded and chaotic situations. I also point out how the synergy between this spatial planning and the ideology of treatment has eroded the solidarity and collective identity of inmates.
The second part of the chapter explores the phenomenon of the bureaucratisation of punishment: the way in which punishment has restructured itself in order to put greater distance between society and prison. To this end, I shall describe the use of videoconferencing for pre-trial detainees held in maximum security, a recent technology that strikes at the soul without biting the flesh, which is emblematic of a punishment that renews its legitimacy while maintaining its logic and civilising its expressions. These final reflections are linked to the most recent changes taking place in Italian prisons, processes that the advent of the pandemic and the riots inside prisons since March 2020 have accelerated, but which could already be perceived in the critical letters sent to OLGa.
This chapter explains some of the governmental trends that go beyond the specificities of prison regimes. It describes how, starting with the dismantling of prison football fields, the determination to organise spaces and social relations on a governmental level can be observed. The chapter defines how the large fields on which new pavilions were built have been replaced by smaller, more controllable pitches, leaving less and less room for crowded and chaotic situations. It explores how the synergy between this spatial planning and the ideology of treatment has eroded the solidarity and collective identity of inmates. Prison governmentality is the art of governing the institution responsible for enforcing a sentence, and differentiation is the logic of prison governmentality that best characterises the Italian context. Prison governmentality, taking its cue from this example of the reorganisation of sociality, also seeks to sterilise or crush all forms of spontaneous solidarity.

N2  - Recent literature documents extensive substance misuse histories among US female prison inmates. The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether histories of personal and familial substance misuse distinguished female inmates from substance misusers in treatment. After accounting for drug-related offences, we hypothesized that the inmates would have more extensive histories of personal and familial substance misuse and that they would have initiated substance use at an earlier age. Contrary to our expectations, the two samples were similar on many measures of alcohol and drug use. Similarly, differences in family histories of substance misuse were not in the predicted direction. As hypothesized, however, the inmates did report earlier age at onset of drinking. Of particular clinical relevance was the finding that, despite similar alcohol consumption levels, inmates reported fewer alcohol-related adverse medical, legal, and psychosocial consequences than did the treatment sample.

N2  - Objective: This study set out to determine the extent of alcohol and drug disorder among male prisoners prior to their incarceration in a New Zealand prison. Method: Sections of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule that assess alcohol and drug disorders according to DSM-III criteria were administered to 100 sequential new arrivals at a male medium/minimum security prison.
Results: Eighty-one percent of the prisoners had a lifetime alcohol disorder, and 39% of them had symptoms in the 6 months prior to incarceration. Half of the prisoners had met criteria for an alcohol-dependence syndrome. Thirty percent had a lifetime drug use disorder with 14% showing symptoms in the last 6 months prior to incarceration. One-quarter had been drug dependent. After adjustment of the lifetime prevalence estimates for the differing age distribution within the prison, alcohol disorder was more than twice as common among prisoners as in the general population, and drug use disorder was eight times as common.
Conclusions: Since high rates of alcohol and drug disorder are found among sentenced prisoners, both in the 6 months prior to incarceration and over their lifetime, resources within the prison may need to be directed towards minimising the harm from substance use disorder and associated risk behaviour.

N2  - The present study was designed to evaluate whether drug dependence is associated with any specific perception of the role of drugs in crime. In the summers of 1997 and 1998, face-to-face interviews were conducted with members of a group of incoming prisoners at the Cuyahoga County Jail in Cleveland, Ohio. "Incoming prisoners" denotes persons whose criminal cases had been adjudicated and who were on their way to one of Ohio's prisons. Respondents were asked whether they themselves perceived that drugs had been a factor in the crimes for which they had been arrested. Those respondents classified as dependent on at least one illicit drug tended to answer affirmatively. This sub-group was also more likely than their non-dependent counterparts to admit to using drugs in the two days following the commission of their crimes. Specifically, these respondents viewed the need to obtain drugs for personal use as one of their main motives for participating in crime.

N2  - Abstract Despite the high rates of depression among substance-abusing female prisoners, no study has tested the efficacy of treatment for this underserved population with complex treatment needs to date. This feasibility study tested group interpersonal psychotherapy for depression adapted for women in prison substance use treatment programs. Twenty-six female prisoners with current diagnoses of major depression and/or dysthymic disorder plus at least one substance use disorder participated in this uncontrolled pilot study. Six consecutive groups met 24 times over 8 weeks. Of the 25 study participants who began the treatment groups, 18 (72%) no longer met the criteria for any depressive disorder by the end of treatment. Depressive symptoms and perceived social support improved significantly by the end of treatment. These pilot results suggest that addressing depressive symptoms via interpersonal concerns is feasible for women in a prison substance use treatment program despite multiple Axes I and II comorbidities.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Sexually active adolescents, especially those in detention, are at high risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV infection. Yet little information is available that describes their risk behaviors associated with STDs. The overall objective was to define the relationship between risk behaviors and STD acquisition among adolescents. Goals of this Study: The first goal was to characterize drug use and sexual behaviors that place a population of adolescent male detainees at STD/HIV risk. The second goal was to define possible interrelationships between drug use, especially alcohol use, and risky sexual behaviors with STD acquisition. Study Design: The study group consisted of 414 adolescent male detainees 12 to 18 years of age who participated in an interview and a clinical assessment. Two hundred sixty-nine of the 414 subjects agreed to STD laboratory tests, including sérologie testing for hepatitis B and syphilis, and urethral cultures to screen for chlamydial and gonorrheal urethritis. Results: Results showed that 15% had current evidence of at least one STD, and 34% had a history or current evidence of at least one STD (STD occurrence). The subjects were frequently engaging in risky sexual and drug use behaviors. Two multivariate models described three factors that significantly place the male adolescent in detention at risk for STDs: multiple sexual partners, inconsistent condom use, and the quantity of alcohol consumed per week. Conclusion: Youth in detention place themselves at risk for STDs including HIV because of their risky sexual behavior and drug use. Addressing alcohol use and barriers to condom use appear to be essential components of any STD prevention program targeting this largely minority youth population.

N2  - In this study, sexual risk behavior of 104 incarcerated female drug users is examined. Findings demonstrate that incarcerated women who use drugs are at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection because of their behavior prior to arrest. During the month prior to arrest, the majority of respondents were sexually active. Half reported past sexual contacts with injecting drug users, and more than one-third had traded sex for money or drugs. Consistent with other studies, condom use was more frequent with casual or commercial partners. Those who traded sex for money were less likely to be white Anglo or regular heroin users, and more likely to be regular crack users and alcoholic, have fathers who were drug or alcohol users, and perceive themselves as at-risk for contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

N2  - This study addresses ways in which inmates at the only maximum‐security prison for women in Neuse City (in the northeastern United States) redefine their social world in order to survive incarceration. An aim of the project is to engage in theory building in order to examine the experiences of a world that is “lived in the round.” A life in the round is a public form of life. It is a lifestyle with an enormous degree of imprecision. Yet, it is this inexactitude that provides an acceptable level of certainty. This way of life sets standards by which one constructs everyday meaning from reality. It is a “taken‐for‐granted,” “business‐as‐usual” style of being. Relying on ethnographic research and interviews with 80 women at the prison, the findings revealed that a life in the round was sustaining a “normative” existence.

N2  - A study was performed in order to determine the prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, the risk factors for HCV infection and the markers of hepatic disease in a population of prisoners. Of 101 new prisoners admitted to a Norwegian national prison over a three month period, 70 were included in the study, of whom 32 (46 %) were anti-HCV positive. Intravenous drug abuse was the predominant risk factor for HCV infection, although a history of tattooing was found by logistic regression analysis to be a significant risk factor independent of intravenous drug abuse. Most anti-HCV positive prisoners had a history of previous incarcerations. Among the anti-HCV positive subjects, increased alanine aminotransferase (> 50 U/l) was found in 23 (72 %). HCV infection was the major cause of hepatic abnormalities in the study population. Only 15 (47 %) of the anti-HCV positive prisoners reported knowledge of previous hepatic disease.

N2  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of HIV by anonymous saliva testing in Her Majesty's Prison, Saughton (Saughton Prison), Edinburgh, UK. To elicit linked anonymous risk factor information from which to estimate risk scores for those who had taken an HIV blood test and, among drug injectors, for those who were HIV-1-antibody-positive on saliva testing.
Setting. Saughton Prison on 15 and 16 August 1991; HIV Immunology and Regional Virus Laboratories, Edinburgh, and the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK.
Participants: Male inmates (378 out of a total of 499) of Saughton Prison.
Main outcome measures: Answers to a brief questionnaire about age, usual residence, present and past custodial sentences, drug injecting and sexual behaviour prior to and in prison, HIV testing and history of acute hepatitis. HIV-1-antibody status was established by saliva testing.
Results: Eighteen per cent of participants were injecting drug users (IDU), of whom approximately one-half (47%) had injected while inside prison. Ninety men (26%), including 40 (14%) of 278 participants who had never injected drugs and 77% of IDU participants, had taken an HIV blood test. Nine per cent of all participants and 35% of IDU participants had had an acute attack of hepatitis. Forty-one (62%) of 66 IDU had been imprisoned five or more times before their current prison sentence. After taking account of region of residence, injecting drug history and acute hepatitis, aspects of sentencing and sexual behaviour were not determinants of those who had been tested for HIV. On the study days, 18 out of 499 (3.6%) participants were known to prison medical officers to be HIV-infected. Following saliva testing, HIV prevalence was 17 out of 375 (4.5%) inmates tested. All 17 had at some time 'taken the blood test for HIV' and all had injected non-medically prescribed drugs. Edinburgh residence, age 26-30 years, having injected in prison and having first injected before 1983 all contributed to the risk score for whether an IDU was HIV-1-antibody-positive on saliva testing.
Conclusions: Documented HIV prevalence in saliva was 4.5%, which - assuming no, volunteer bias (as supported by questionnaire returns) - suggests that actual HIV prevalence was 25% greater than revealed to Saughton's prison medical service. All 17 inmates who were HIV-1-antibody-positive on saliva testing had injected non-medically prescribed drugs. The high reported frequency by inmates of injecting in prison highlights the urgent requirement for drug reduction and rehabilitation programmes for injecting inmates. Linked anonymous voluntary HIV testing of saliva can provide valuable information about HIV prevalence for the planning of prison resources and policy.

N2  - Abstract Drug treatment aftercare is frequently cited as necessary for individuals served within the criminal justice system. The purposes of this article are to review how much is actually known about aftercare and to highlight issues in studying the role of aftercare. We begin with a review of the literature, looking at how aftercare is defined within the criminal justice system outcome literature and the findings on aftercare for offenders who received initial treatment from in-prison substance use treatment programs. We continue with a discussion of how substance use treatment provided within the federal system, drug use patterns, and responses to drug use create methodological difficulties in adequately assessing the effectiveness of aftercare services. Taking into account both the previous research on aftercare and the issues encountered in attempting to evaluate the federal aftercare services, we concluded that the claim of certainty about aftercare effectiveness is not well substantiated and that the precise nature of aftercare services needed is not well understood. We conclude with a discussion of the methodological and substantive issues that need to be addressed in future research. Issues identified include the need to address self-selection bias and to disentangle offender behavior from the effects of criminal justice system policies. Research is also needed to identify the most effective type and intensity of aftercare.

N2  - Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women arrested for drug offenses, and many have serious drug abuse problems. Increasingly, these women have been mandated to drug treatment, often in community-based settings. This article examines the impact of the treatment programs on the short-term posttreatment drug use of women offenders (N = 165) leaving two community-based treatment programs in Portland, Oregon. Our analyses indicate that women who abstained from drug use during the first week after treatment were more likely than those who used drugs during this time to have remained in treatment longer, received a plan to make a successful transition out of treatment, avoided associations with other drug users after leaving treatment, and obtained encouragement from individuals and groups in support of abstinence.

N2  - Violence inflicted by individuals with mental illness towards healthcare workers has received significant media attention. Though such incidents are relatively infrequent, they inspire reactive responses and contribute to further stigmatization of the mentally ill. Prevention of violence is an important challenge for those who train and supervise mental health workers. Project Link is an outpatient treatment program designed to reduce jail and hospital recidivism among severely mentally ill adults with histories of criminal justice system involvement. Utilizing a Safety and Violence Education (SAVE) curriculum, Project Link has successfully transitioned high-risk mentally ill individuals from the criminal justice system into the community since 1995. The SAVE curriculum uses a preventative strategy to train case managers to identify warning signs of impending violence, and to safely engage patients in community settings. This paper will present an overview of the SAVE curriculum and its development, as well as results from a preliminary evaluation of trainee satisfaction.

N2  - To assess the health effects of writing about traumatic events in a clinical population, 98 psychiatric prison inmates were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions in which they were asked to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings surrounding upsetting experiences (trauma writing condition), write about trivial topics (trivial writing control), or go about their daily routine without writing (no-writing control). Both writing groups wrote for 20 min per day for 3 consecutive days. Participants in the trauma condition reported experiencing more physical symptoms subsequent to the intervention relative to those in the other conditions. Despite this, controlling for prewriting infirmary visits, sex offenders in the trauma writing condition decreased their postwriting infirmary visits. These results are congruent with predictions based on stigmatization and inhibition.

N2  - Psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression have long been associated with risk behaviors for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The US prison population is reported to have elevated rates of HIV, hepatitis and most psychiatric disorders. This study examined the association of six major psychiatric disorders with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV/HBV co-infection in one of the nation's largest prison populations. The study population consisted of 370,511 Texas Department of Criminal Justice inmates who were incarcerated for any duration between January 1, 2003 and July 1, 2006. Information on medical conditions and sociodemographic factors was obtained from an institution-wide electronic medical information system. Offenders diagnosed with HIV mono-infection, HIV/HCV, HIV/HBV and all HIV combined exhibited elevated rates of major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorder and any psychiatric disorder. In comparison to offenders with HIV mono-infection, those with HIV/HCV co-infection had an elevated prevalence of any psychiatric disorder. This cross-sectional study's finding of positive associations between psychiatric disease and both HIV infection and hepatitis co-infection among Texas prison inmates holds both clinical and public health relevance. It will be important for future investigations to examine the extent to which psychiatric disorders serve as a barrier to medical care, communication with clinicians and adherence to prescribed medical regimens among both HIV-mono-infected and HIV/hepatitis-co-infected inmates.

N2  - Objective: This study was designed to evaluate an innovative program of high speed radiographic screening for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) at a large urban correctional institution, Cook County Jail in Chicago. Methods: From March 1992 to February 1994, 126,608 inmates were screened on intake with a 100-mm mini-chest radiograph. Results: Sixty-seven cause of active TB were identified by radiograph and 19 others from diagnostic work-up. The case finding rate for active disease with radiographic screening was approximately double the rate previously achieved with Mantoux skin testing. Mean time from jail entry to isolation was reduced from 17.6 days with Mantoux skin testing to 2.3 days with radiographic screening. Conclusions: In large jail facilities, high speed X-ray screening for TB can minimize disruption of the intake process and lead to dramatic improvements in the efficiency of medical follow-up and isolation.

N2  - Purpose: Incarcerated adolescents are at increased risk for infection by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Moreover, condom use by this population is extremely low. Although interpersonal variables such as sexual communication have been found to be associated with condom use in other populations, few researchers have investigated this relationship among adolescents requiring detention in juvenile facilities. The present study investigated the relationship between communication about sexual history and incarcerated adolescents' condom use.
Methods: We used multivariate logistic regression techniques to analyze interview data from a predominantly Latino sample of 2,132 sexually active adolescents detained in Los Angeles County Juvenile Hall.
Results: Despite high numbers of lifetime sexual partners, a substantial majority of respondents (67%) reported that they never used condoms during sexual intercourse. Respondents who communicated with their sex partner(s) about each others' sexual history were significantly more likely to use condoms during sexual intercourse. Adolescents who reported that they knew someone with AIDS were also more likely to use condoms.
Conclusions: Interventions designed to increase condom use among sexually active incarcerated adolescents should include a component addressing sexual communication practices. More research is needed on the ways in which adolescents learn to communicate about sex.

N2  - This article reports on data derived from an investigation of the self‐esteem, health habits, and knowledge of breast self‐examination (BSE) practice in female inmates. A descriptive correlational study was conducted with a prison sample of 197 adult females incarcerated in a women's state prison. Major findings of the study suggest that female inmates in general had medium to high self‐esteem, poor health habits before incarceration, and minimal knowledge about BSE practice. Only 26% reported correct knowledge related to frequency in BSE practice, and few reported that they knew correct BSE technique. In addition, findings suggest that a correlation does not exist between self‐esteem and knowledge of BSE practice, and participants' last grade completed served as a good predictor of women's knowledge of BSE practice.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine low birthweight (LBW) and fetal death rates for women incarcerated in a large county jail during their pregnancy. Additionally, medical and support services available to these inmates were reviewed. Jail records showed this population to be both medically and socially high risk. Analysis indicated that their LBW rate was statistically higher (p < 0.05) than that of the county or state, but comparable to a matched group residing in high‐risk areas of the city in which many of these women resided. During the course of the study, numerous jail policies were identified which had the potential to negatively impact the health of these women and their pregnancy outcomes.

N2  - This study examines gender similarities and differences in background characteristics, the effectiveness of treatment, and the predictors of post-release outcomes among incarcerated drug-using offenders. The sample of 1,842 male and 473 female treatment and comparison subjects came from a multi-site evaluation of prison-based substance abuse treatment programs. Three-year follow-up data for recidivism and post-release drug use were analyzed using survival analysis methods. Despite the greater number of life problems among women than men, women had lower three-year recidivism rates and rates of post-release drug use than did men. For both men and women, treated subjects had longer survival times than those who were not treated. There were both similarities and differences with respect to gender and the other predictors of the two post-release outcomes. Differences in background characteristics and in factors related to post-release outcomes for men and women suggest the plausibility of gender-specific paths in the recovery process.

N2  - The development and implementation of a departmental performance evaluation system for a correctional managed care pharmacy are described.
Health care services for approximately 150,000 offenders within the Texas Department of Criminal Justice are provided through an arrangement with two university systems, the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. UTMB provides all distributive pharmacy services through a central pharmacy located in Huntsville, Texas. The pharmacy department distributes 9,000-15,000 medication orders daily to over 140 facilities. Each department within UTMB Correctional Managed Care is evaluated against predetermined quality indicators. This evaluation system is collectively called the operational performance evaluation system (OPES) and is used, in part, to determine pay-for-performance eligibility. Before fiscal year 2001, pharmacy distributive services were provided under a third university system. Joining the UTMB system required the pharmacy department to not only participate in OPES but to develop quality indicators and measurement systems to evaluate departmental performance. Indicators were chosen to reflect a commitment to quality while assuring appropriate productivity in the provision of pharmaceutical care. Seven pharmaceutical care quality indicators were chosen and weighted by perceived importance. A system for data collection, measurement, and reporting was also developed.
Implementation of a departmental performance evaluation system provides a means to measure service quality, identify areas of weakness, track performance over time, and lower costs. By setting concrete goals, this system raises awareness and promotes interdependence among department personnel.

N2  - Objective: To assess the impact of HIV/AIDS on the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and to analyse the determinants of TB presenting as the first indicative disease of AIDS.
Design: Analysis of TB and AIDS surveillance data.
Setting: Catalonia, north-east Spain.
Patients: Two separate sources were used: (i) TB cases reported to the Catalan TB registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1993; (ii) AIDS cases reported to the AIDS Catalan registry diagnosed between January 1982 and December 1994.
Main outcome measures: Expected and observed TB cases, and number and characteristics of AIDS cases presenting with TB.
Results: From 1987 to 1993 the annual TB crude incidence rate increased by 50% to a rate of 49.7 per 100 000, with at least 60% of the increase directly due to AIDS. During that period specific rates among children aged 0-4 years remained high at around 40 per 100 000. A total of 7010 AIDS cases were diagnosed between 1988 and 1994, of whom 24.3% had TB. Multivariate analysis from those AIDS cases showed that besides male sex, young age, and urban residence, the strongest predictors of TB among AIDS cases were history of imprisonment (odds ratio, 2.16; P < 0.001) and intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 1.65; P < 0.001).
Conclusions: The high rates of TB among children and young adults suggest that TB transmission has increased during this period, especially among people al high risk of AIDS. The determinants of individual risk of TB among AIDS patients act together, especially in prisons. The HIV/TB coepidemic is an emerging threat potentially for all and requires expanding targeted measures to prevent and control both diseases in our setting.

N2  - An anonymous, voluntary, linked cohort study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of HIV infection and identify risk factors for the spread of infection in an English prison. Three hundred and seventy-eight (68%) of the inmates participated. The HIV point prevalence was 0.26%. Injecting drug use (IDU) was the most significant HIV risk factor within 20% admitting IDU at any time, of whom 58% injected whilst in prison. Of those injecting in prison 73% shared needles. Two inmates admitted having sex with a male partner in prison. This study demonstrates that the potential exists in this setting for an outbreak of blood-borne virus infection; hapatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection. Injecting drug use and needle sharing represent the greatest risk.

N2  - The relative contributions of needle use practices and sexual behaviors to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody seropositivity among 394 women incarcerated in Quebec were determined by risk factor assessment and serology with a nonnominal methodology. HIV positivity was found in 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.6, 9.9) of all participants and in 13% (95% CI = 8.6, 18.6) of women with a history of injection drug use. HIV seropositivity among women with a history of injection drug use was predicted by sexual or needle contact with a seropositive person, self-reported genital herpes, and having had a regular sexual partner who injected drugs, but it was not predicted by prostitution. Nonnominal testing is an ethical alternative to mandatory and anonymous unlinked testing among correctional populations.

N2  - A blinded seroprevalence survey for HIV-1 infection was conducted among individuals entering New York City (NYC) prisons in 1989. Data collected included age group, race/ethnicity, syphilis serologic results and self-admitted drug use. Remnant serum specimens were tested for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot. Of 2236 inmates surveyed, 413 (18.5%) were HIV-1 positive. Rates varied by subgroup, and were higher for women than men (25.8 versus 16.1%; odds ratio 1.8; P < 0.01), for drug users than inmates who denied drug use (25 versus 14%; odds ratio 2.3; P < 0.01), for intravenous heroin users (43 versus 15% in drug users not using heroin), and for inmates with positive rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) results (34.5 versus 16.1% in RPR-negative inmates). Use of intravenous heroin was most strongly related, by logistic regression, to HIV-1 seropositivity. The results are among the highest found in US inmates, and suggest that there were 12 500 seropositive individuals incarcerated in 1989. This represents approximately 10% of the estimated number of seropositive individuals in NYC. The NYC Correctional System should be viewed as a front-line institution in the fight against AIDS through provision of HIV-related prevention services and clinical care, and drug treatment.

N2  - Correctional facilities have become collection and containment centres for HIV-seropositive individuals. This is due to factors that affect incarceration in general: past criminal behaviour, age and crime type. In addition, the sex trade industry, intravenous drug use and community instability are likely factors affecting this particular population. The objective of this study was to determine whether HIV-positive offenders have higher rates of rearrest than HIV-negative offenders. A sample of HIV-positive offenders ( n = 57) were seen for mental health evaluation at the King County Correctional Facility (KCCF) in Seattle Washington. They were compared to a historical sample ( n = 254) of HIV-negative individuals also from the KCCF. After three months, 50% of both samples had been rearrested. Using the log rank test in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, statistical difference in the relative risk of rearrest occurred for the HIV-positive group (logrank = 0.03). Statistical adjustment for mental illness, age, race, ethnicity, substance abuse history and past criminal history did not affect rearrest significantly. Nonetheless, HIV-positive individuals who presented with mental health needs appeared to be significantly more vulnerable to rearrest after the first three months of release into the community.

N2  - Aims. To determine levels of injecting drug use and sexual risk behaviours in injecting drug users during and immediately following imprisonment in The Netherlands. Design, setting and participants. Crosssectional survey of drug injectors attending methadone clinics, a sexually transmitted disease clinic and a central research site in Amsterdam. The mean age of the 188 participants was 35 years, 78% were male and 34% had HIV antibodies . Measurements. Self‐reported drug use and sexual behaviours during the last period of imprisonment in Dutch prisons within the previous 3 years and injecting drug use in the week following release from prison . Findings. A period of imprisonment in the preceding 3 years was reported by 188 (41%) of 463 interviewed drug injectors. The mean duration of last imprisonment was 3.6 months. Any use of cannabis, heroin or cocaine during imprisonment was reported by 55%, 37% and 20%, respectively. Five injectors (3%) admitted to having injected in prison, but no sharing of needles and syringes was reported. Vaginal or anal sex was reported by two (1%) of the men and none of the women. Relapse to drug injecting during the week following release from prison was reported by 78/186 (42%) participants, in most cases (34%) at the very first day of release. Drug use behaviours during imprisonment were similar for those who were designated current injectors at the time of imprisonment and those who were not, but injecting in the first week following release from prison was far higher among 'current' injectors (63%) than among those who were not (11%) . Conclusions. Contrary to findings from other countries, low levels of HIV risk behaviours occur among imprisoned drug injectors in The Netherlands. Intra‐prison HIV preventive measures should be considered taking into account the nationally, regionally or locally varying conditions within the existing prisons.

N2  - Recent studies comparing self-admitted cocaine use with hair and urine test results have raised concerns about underreporting due to variations across situations and settings. Because of the frequent need for self-report data in conducting treatment evaluations, more information is needed on factors that affect the credibility of this information. the present study examines records of cocaine use collected as part of an evaluation of prison-based treatment (N = 396). Specifically, self-reported cocaine use from 6-month postrelease follow-up interviews, completed with treatment graduates and a comparison sample of parolees who were eligible but not sent to treatment, was examined in relation to urine and hair test results. Overall, cocaine use was underreported when compared to hair test results, but underreporting was lower for program graduates than for the untreated comparison group. Furthermore, program graduates originally admitted to prison on a drug-related arrest were the most likely to underre-port cocaine use, seemingly due to a heightened concern about potential consequences, such as returning to prison on another drug-related charge. Given that the validity of self-report for high-risk individuals varies greatly and is difficult to predict across studies, future research with criminal justice samples should continue to assess the validity of these measures under specific research conditions and for diverse types of individuals.

N2  - Four years after the occurrence of an outbreak of hepatitis B and HIV infection among
injecting drug user inmates at Her Majesty's Prison Glenochil in Scotland, a study design was
developed to complete the epidemiological account of the HIV outbreak. Our aim was to
identify potential cases of (1) HIV transmission not diagnosed during the original outbreak
investigation and (2) the source(s) of the outbreak. Scotland's HIV positive case register was
searched for matches to a soundexed list of 636 Glenochil inmates imprisoned during
January–June 1993. Eight HIV infections that may have been acquired in Glenochil and four
possible sources of the outbreak were identified. The second stage of follow-up – molecular
epidemiological techniques used on stored sera samples from identified individuals – is
described in the companion paper. Without breach of medical or prisoner confidentiality,
indirect and anonymous follow-up has proved possible for the Glenochil inmates.

N2  - This data linkage study examined the extent of hepatitis B transmission
and co-infection with
HIV among 636 former inmates of Glenochil prison, Scotland, during an outbreak
of
bloodborne diseases in 1993 which was related to needle sharing. Eleven
inmates imprisoned
during the first half of 1993 presented with hepatitis B infection, of
whom co-infection with
HIV was detected in six. Based on dates of test results in relation to
time of imprisonment,
seven definitely acquired their hepatitis B infection within the
prison. Only two infections were
reported to Scotland's hepatitis B register and neither could be
prison-linked. This outbreak of
hepatitis B is the first of its kind to be reported but not the
first to have occurred. It not only
highlights the urgency for measures to prevent further spread of infection
among prisoners but
also illustrates the need for comprehensive surveillance of hepatitis B
infection, and the need
for a protocol on how to manage such outbreaks and on how to establish
the extent of
transmissions when acute hepatitis B occurs in prison.

N2  - Objective: To review a 1995 Pap smear screening program at Burnaby Correctional Centre for Women (BCCW). Method: 129 inmates (15%), were screened in BCCW in 1995. General population data were obtained from the British Columbia Cervical Cytology Screening Program (BC CCSP) Registry. Results: BCCW inmates aged 25-29 years were 11 times more likely to have high grade cytologie abnormalities on Pap smear screening compared with age-matched general population (p< 10⁻¹⁰). In the 20-34 year age group, 47% of BCCW inmates had received at least one Pap smear in 1992-1994, compared with 87% of the general population (p< 0.001). There was no relationship between Pap smear results and BCCW inmate ethnicity (p=0.85). Conclusions: Prison inmates presented with more severe abnormalities on Pap smear screening at a younger age, and had received Pap smear screening less frequently, compared with the general population. Objectif : passer en revue un programme de dépistage par frottis mené en 1995 au Centre correctionnel pour les femmes de Burnaby. Méthode : 129 détenues (15 %) ont eu un dépistage par frottis au Centre correctionnel en 1995. Les données démographiques générales ont été fournies par le registre du programme de dépistage de la cytologie cervicale de la Colombie-Britannique. Résultats : les détenues du Centre correctionnel âgées de 25 à 29 ans avaient onze fois plus de chance de présenter des anomalies cytologiques graves lors du frottis que la population générale du même âge (p < 10⁻¹⁰). Dans la catégorie des 20 à 34 ans, 47 % des détenues avaient eu au moins un frottis en 1992-1994 en comparaison avec 87 % de la population générale (p < 0,001). On n'a pas observé de lien entre les résultats des frottis et l'ethnicité des détenues du Centre correctionnel (p = 0,85). Conclusions : en comparaison avec la population générale, un plus grand nombre d'anomalies graves ont été dépistées par frottis chez les détenues à un âge plus précoce, et les dépistages par frottis sont moins fréquents chez les détenues.

N2  - Placement of prisoners in 'strip' cells has been criticized as inappropriate for those with psychotic symptoms and at risk of suicide and self-harm. A national survey confirmed that prisoners who reported having been placed in special cells had extensive histories of previous psychiatric treatment, parasuicide and diagnoses of depression and schizophrenia. They were more likely to have cluster A and C Axis II personality disorders and criminal histories of arson and sexual offending. Current policy for mentally disordered prisoners who pose risks to themselves and others reflects the lack of more appropriate facilities for disturbed mentally disordered individuals in prison and psychiatric hospitals, and the failure of 'diversion' to NHS psychiatric inpatient facilities. In future, all prisoners placed in 'strip' cell conditions should receive specialist psychiatric assessment.

N2  - A random sample of 1009 adult male prison inmates from 13 prisons covering short-, medium- and long-term establishments across England and Wales was interviewed about sexual behaviour, drug use and tattooing, inside and outside prison. We report here on their same-sex sexual activity. Thirty-seven men reported having engaged in sexual activity with a man during adulthood. Twenty-two men reported having had sex with a man in prison. Indirect support for this prevalence rate was given by sexually transmitted disease rates and prisoners' estimates of same-sex sexual activity occurring in prison. Twenty out of the twenty-two inmates had engaged in same-sex sexual activity previously outside prison. Two men had sex for the first time in prison (uncoerced). Approximately one-quarter of men who had same-sex sexual activity in prison reported having been coerced into having sex at some point. Same-sex sexual activity appears to be less frequent in the UK prison system as a whole than has previously been suggested.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the efficacy of radiographic screening for tuberculosis in correctional facilities. METHODS: Inmates at an admission facility in New York, NY, were screened for tuberculosis by registry cross-match, symptom interviews, tuberculin testing, and chest radiography. RESULTS: Thirty-two cases of tuberculosis were detected among 4172 inmate admissions (767 cases per 100,000). Twenty-five inmates (78%) were previously diagnosed but incompletely treated; all were identified by registry cross-match. Seven inmates (22%) were newly diagnosed, of whom four (57%) were asymptomatic, had negative skin tests, and were detected only by their abnormal radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: Screening strategies that limit radiographic testing to inmates with either positive skin tests or symptoms may result in missed opportunities for diagnosing active tuberculosis.

N2  - A survey was conducted in 1995 to assess the prevalence of TB infection using the PPD skin test infection among 3931 immates in all 21 jails in Leb anon. Forty-five percent of participants had a positive PPD skin test. The likelihood of testing positive was higher among those who had been incarcerated for more than 3 years versus less than that. Compared to prisoners whose usual residence was Central Lebanon, those from North Lebanon and those from outside Lebanon (mostly Syria and Egypt) had a higher risk for PPD positivity, those from Bekaa a lower risk, and those from South Lebanon about the same risk. Among those with positive PPD tests, 7% had abnormal chest X-rays suggestive of active infection. Results suggest that TB infection is an important health problem in correctional facilities in Lebanon and that special control programs should target North Lebanon. The importance of screening the incarcerated population with chest X-rays rather than PPD skin tests is discussed.

N2  - This paper describes the prevalence of, and risk factors for, exposure to syphilis in
a random sample of male and female prisoners. We found that only 2% of male and 1% of
female prison inmates in New South Wales (NSW) had confirmed evidence of untreated
syphilis, and none appeared to be in an infectious phase. In the multivariate
analysis, indigenous ethnicity remained the most potent predictor for confirmed
syphilis (either past or present). There was some evidence to suggest that syphilis
among indigenous prisoners may be associated with limited access to health services
outside prison. The epidemiology of syphilis reflects that of the general community
suggesting that prisons could be used as sentinel sites to help evaluate the
effectiveness of STD prevention and control strategies.

N2  - In this chapter of The Pixelated Prisoner I argue that video link systems effectively relocate the custody dock away from the public courtroom and into the new conceptual court space located in prison. This conceptual relocation of the custody dock to the prison video studio creates a heightened spatial demarcation between defendants appearing from prison and the rest of the legal participants in the remote courtroom. I compare the formal space of a public courtroom with the non-public and detention-grade space of a prison video suite. First, I consider the nature of the traditional courtroom custody dock and its inherent tensions with the presumption of innocence. Then prisoners’ interviews are drawn upon to reveal spatial elements of custodial appearance and the qualitative attributes of carceral space. One attribute that surprised me was the ambient sonic world of prison and how it infiltrates AVL sessions; this is examined as the ‘soundtrack of incarceration’. Ultimately, the conjoining of prison with courtroom puts in question the suitability of prison as a space for the administration of criminal justice.
This chapter argues that video link systems effectively relocate the custody dock away from the public courtroom and into the new conceptual court space located in prison. It compares the formal space of a public courtroom with the non-public and detention-grade space of a prison video suite. The chapter considers the nature of the traditional courtroom custody dock and its inherent tensions with the presumption of innocence. It examines how the criminal justice system is moving into a 'videosphere' where prisoners' communication with the outside human world is framed 'face-to-interface', their court 'appearance' is on a screen, and their bodily presence remains in prison, remote from the site of legal adjudication. The chapter analyses the interview in terms of the altered spatial relationships generated by video links. It seeks to reveal prisoners' experiences of the changing site of criminal justice and why they still feel the need to occasionally 'land' physically in courtrooms for substantive criminal procedures and confidential interactions.

N2  - Combining evidence from social learning theory with reports of the association between community violence exposure and aggressive behavior development, the authors examined the link between specific characteristics of violence exposure and social information-processing mechanisms (

;
K. A. Dodge, 1980
,

) in a sample of highly aggressive, incarcerated adolescent boys (
N
= 110). Results demonstrated that victimization by severe violence was significantly related to approval of aggression as a social response, problems with the interpretation of social cues, and maladaptive social goals. Witnessing severe violence, in contrast, was related to perceived positive outcomes for the use of aggression. These data suggest the importance of examining the severity and modality of exposure to community violence for understanding patterns of social-cognitive functioning among adolescents exposed to violence.

N2  - Objectives A cross-sectional epidemiologie survey was conducted among prison staff in France to investigate the relationships between work conditions and mental health. Methods The sample included men and women 20 to 64 years of age belonging to all categories of prison personnel (prison guards, administrative staff, socioeducational workers, technicians, health care workers, and managers). A postal self-administered questionnaire was used to assess sociodemographic factors, work conditions, and physical and mental disorders. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of work conditions and social relationships on the mental health of prison staff. Results The results presented in this report only concern depressive symptomatology (measured by the French version of the Center for Epidemiologie Studies Depression Scale), anxiety (measured by the state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and sleep disorders. The percentage of mental disorders was higher among prison staff than that determined for other occupational samples. Guards comprised the prison staff least affected by these symptoms. Conclusions The results show that, in our sample, the factors concerning the subjective evaluation of work conditions and social support were more closely related to mental disorders than work conditions. In addition, seniority was associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety among the men.

N2  - The South Oaks Gambling inventory was administered to 136 consecutively admitted inmates in a medium-security prison in Nevada. Assording to the criteria of the authors of this instrument, 22.79% of these inmates had some problem and 26% were probable pathological gamblers. Significant positive correlations with the F, depression, psychopathic deviate, psychasthenia, paranoia, schizophrenia, and Mac Andrew alcoholism scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were found. Gambling score was negatively correlated with the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices measure of intelligence. Clinical implications are suggested.

N2  - While marijuana and cocaine are the two most prevalent drugs used among arrestee populations, benzodiazepine use has surpassed that of opiates in several jurisdictions across the United States. Despite this proliferation, few scholarly works have focused on benzodiazepine use among individuals under criminal justice supervision. In the present study, chi-square statistics and logistic regression are utilized to identify significant associations between recent benzodiazepine use (as measured by urinalysis), demographic characteristics, and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use among a sample of 862 adult Philadelphia arrestees interviewed in 1997 through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program. Compared to nonusers, benzodiazepine-positive respondents were more likely to be White, to have used alcohol and barbiturates in the three days preceding the interview, and to have tested positive by urinalysis for marijuana, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine (PCP). Moreover, logistic regression identified that if an arrestee reported three-day barbiturate use, the odds ratio (OR) of recent benzodiazepine use was more than nine times higher than an arrestee who reported no three-day barbiturate use. Implications for drug surveillance are assessed in light of the current findings.

N2  - Purpose: Youths in detention have been identified as a high-risk group for AIDS. To help inform AIDS-prevention efforts targeted for these youths, we surveyed youths in detention regarding their sexual behaviors, beliefs about condoms, intentions to use condoms, and actual condom use. We examined race and gender differences in these beliefs and behaviors, and we studied the relationship of these beliefs to condom-use intentions.
Methods: Questionnaires were administered to a sample of 201 youths in detention who were, on average, 16 years old. The sample was stratified on gender and race (African-American and white), with approximately equal numbers in each group.
Results: The results indicate that these youths had engaged in behaviors that put them at high risk of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. Although they used condoms somewhat more consistently with casual partners than with their steady partners, the majority did not use condoms consistently with either partner type. Very few race or gender differences were found with regard to condom use, intentions to use condoms, or beliefs about the consequences of using condoms. Beliefs associated with intentions to use condoms with steady partners included protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and the beliefs that condoms reduce pleasure, are artificial, unromantic, and interrupt sex. In contrast, only the belief that condoms prevent pregnancy was related to intentions to use condoms with casual partners.
Conclusion: The results suggest that interventions targeted at African-American and white males and females in detention need not differ greatly in content as long as they include the most salient concerns of each group; that interventions include content on the two protective benefits of condom use (pregnancy and STD prevention), as well as on how to minimize the perceived negative aspects of condom use; that they stress the need for condom use with steady as well as casual partners; and that they stress that anal intercourse is especially risky with regard to AIDS transmission.

N2  - Between April and June 1993, 8 cases of acute clinical hepatitis B infection and 2 seroconversions to HIV infection were detected among drug injecting inmates of HM Prison Glenochil in Scotland. To prevent the further spread of infection, an initiative which involved counselling and voluntary attributable HIV testing was conducted over a 10-day period commencing at the end of June. A team of 18 counsellors and phlebotomists was brought together rapidly as part of a unique organizational exercise in the field of public health. Fourteen cases of HIV infection were identified of which 13 were almost certainly infected in Glenochil. Following the exercise, a range of harm reduction measures for injecting prisoners was introduced; these included the availability of hepatitis B vaccine, provision of bleach tablets which could be used to clean injecting equipment, a methadone detoxification programme, increased training for prison officers and improved access to drug and harm minimization counselling for inmates. By mid-1996 all these measures had been sustained and several could be found in many other prisons throughout Scotland. Follow-up investigations showed no evidence of epidemic spread of HIV during the 12 months after the initiative. While the frequency of injecting and needle/syringe sharing may have decreased over the last 3 years, these activities are still being reported and it is highly likely that transmissions of bloodborne infections, in paticular hepatitis C, continue to occur. The surveillance and prevention of infections associated with injecting drug use in the prison setting remain a high public health priority.

N2  - In order to clarify the role of the two broad components of psychopathy (interpersonal/affective and social deviance;
R. D. Hare, 2003
) in explaining maladaptive response perseveration in psychopaths, as well as the role of reflection after punished responses in this deficit, the authors administered a card perseveration task to 47 Spanish male inmates assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R;
R. D. Hare, 1991
). Hierarchical regressions showed that psychopaths' maladaptive perseveration (more cards played and less money earned) was uniquely predicted by the social deviance features of psychopathy (PCL-R Factor 2)-particularly by its impulsive and irresponsible lifestyle facet (PCL-R Facet 3)-and not by its interpersonal/affective features (PCL-R Factor 1). Moreover, perseveration was related to a lack of reflection both after punishment and after reward feedback. The authors' results, in conjunction with previous evidence indicating perseverative deficits in several impulse control disorders, suggest that response perseveration may not be specific to psychopathy but rather is associated more generally with the externalizing dimension of psychopathology.

METHODS A randomized controlled trial was conducted at the San Francisco City and County Jail, San Francisco, Calif. Subjects undergoing therapy for latent tuberculosis infection who spoke either English or Spanish were randomly allocated to receive education every 2 weeks while in jail; an incentive if they went to the San Francisco County Tuberculosis Clinic within 1 month of release; or usual care. The main outcome measures were completion of a visit to the tuberculosis clinic within 1 month of release and completion of therapy. RESULTS Of 558 inmates enrolled, 325 were released before completion of therapy. Subjects in either intervention group were significantly more likely to complete a first visit than were control subjects (education group, 37%; incentive group, 37%; and controls, 24%) (adjusted odds ratio based on pooled results for the education and incentive groups, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-3.28; P = .02). Those in the education group were twice as likely to complete therapy compared with controls (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.72; P = .04). Of those who went to the tuberculosis clinic after release, subjects in the education group were more likely to complete therapy (education group, 65% [24/37]; incentive group, 33% [14/42]; and control group, 48% [12/25]; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Education or the promise of an incentive improved initial follow-up. Education was superior to an incentive for the completion of therapy. Fairly modest strategies provided in jail can improve adherence. Further links between jail health services and community care should be explored.Arch Intern Med. 2002;162:1044-1050-->

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare the wives of Australian soldiers who had been imprisoned during World War II (POWs) with a control group of non-POWs' wives and also to compare the POWs and non-POWs themselves in respect to several psychological and family life characteristics on which differences might be expected to arise from the long-term effects of imprisonment. A random sample of 145 of these veterans and their wives completed several self-administered mood and family life scales, an inventory of somatic symptoms, questions about the impact of the war on the veteran in the postwar decades, and several social background questions. The POWs themselves were more depressed and reported more somatic symptoms and a greater postwar impact of the war than the non-POWs. However, these differences were not accompanied by concomitant differences among their wives. There was some evidence of an influence of the POW's mood on his wife's mood in significant correlations between husbands' and wives' depression and anxiety scale scores in POW couples alone. Otherwise, there was very little indication that the POW experience had any long-term effect on the marriage relationship as measured by the variables included in this study.

N2  - In 1994 a Texas prison containing a population of mentally retarded inmates experienced a large tuberculosis outbreak. Fifteen cases of tuberculosis were identified (8 confirmed by positive cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and more than 100 inmates became infected. The culture-confirmed patients were infected with an identical strain of tuberculosis as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based DNA fingerprinting technique. The prison followed standard tuberculosis infection control policies, but these controls were inadequate to prevent tuberculosis transmission in this special population. Two hundred and thirty inmates (119 inmates showing evidence of new tuberculosis infection or active disease and 111 healthy controls) were enrolled in the investigation. Inmate cell assignments, job duties, and educational classes were identified and medical chart reviews were conducted on all inmates. Tuberculosis transmission was associated with residing on the D Wing of the prison (OR = 25·84, P < 0·01), attending school in Classroom A (OR = 8·34, P = 0·01) and working on the prison utility work crew (OR = 2·52, P < 0·01). The index case in the outbreak had been prescribed 6 months of isoniazid (INH) chemoprophylaxis in 1988.

N2  - A study of injecting behaviour amongst a purposive sample of drug-users in Scottish prisons found that 32% reported injecting prior to current sentence. The percentage of these who were injecting during their current prison sentence (i.e. inside the prison) had fallen to 11%. Of those who were injecting prior to imprisonment, 24% reported sharing injecting equipment at that time. Of those who were still injecting in prison, however, 76% reported sharing equipment. Overall, therefore, there were fewer injectors in prison, but a higher proportion of these shared needles. Factors most closely identified with current sharing of injecting equipment in prison were: (a) having injected a wider range of drugs in prison (during both current and previous sentences); (b) frequency of Temgesic use; and (c) being prescribed methadone in the community, then having that prescription discontinued on entry to prison.

N2  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a public health concern in correctional facilities. High turnover of inmate populations may preclude timely diagnosis of TB, so that unrecognised transmission may be common. Objective: To determine the proportion of inmates with new skin test conversions who had identifiable exposure to diagnosed cases of TB in the correctional system, and to test the hypothesis that source cases of TB may be undiagnosed during incarceration. Setting: Maryland Division of Corrections, USA. Subjects: All inmates whose skin test converted from negative to positive at annual screening. Design: All cases of TB in inmates, diagnosed in the prisons during the relevant time period, were identified. Movements of skin test converters and potential source cases within the prisons were matched. We then matched all inmates discharged from the prison system with all new cases of tuberculosis notified to the Maryland Department of Health & Mental Hygiene tuberculosis registry in 1994. Results: The inmate turnover was 21% per year. Probable exposure to a diagnosed source case was found in 13% of converters, possible exposure in 10% and no exposure in 72%. In a further 5% exposure status could not be determined. We identified four cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified to the state in 1994, within 3 months of discharge in released inmates, who were not known to have tuberculosis whilst incarcerated. Conclusions: Significant transmission of TB due to undiagnosed index cases may occur in prisons due to high population turnover. New skin test conversions in inmates should be treated as new infection, even in the absence of identifiable exposure to TB.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to provide population-based estimates of drug-using arrestees in the 185 largest US cities. METHODS: A prevalence model for drug-using arrestees was developed by relating selected social indicators (from 1990 census data) and drug use rates (from Drug Use Forecasting program data) via logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: It was estimated that in 1990, across the 185 cities, about 925,000 arrestees used cocaine, 317,000 used opiates, 213,000 used amphetamines, 389,000 were drug injectors, and 1,296,000 used an illicit drug. CONCLUSIONS: This approach represents a cost-efficient method for prevalence estimation based on empirically demonstrable relationships between social indicators and drug use rates.

N2  - I am on a ride-along with a vice unit whose enforcement activities include prostitution and sex trafficking as well as non-sex-related vice crimes. The unit covers approximately ten square miles of a densely populated area presumed to be a hotbed of prostitution and gang activity. The station where the unit is located is just a few blocks away from a few well-known “strolls” where street-based prostitution is known to take place. For a mid-June, early week ridealong, it proves to be a whirlwind night. In the first two hours of observation, officers in the unit execute a search warrant at

N2  - Background and Objectives: Female inmates have high rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and many incarcerated women and jail providers believe STDs are acquired within the jail. We investigated a suspected outbreak of trichomoniasis among female inmates and described the epidemiology of trichomonas infection. Goals of this Study: To determine the likelihood of within-jail acquisition of trichomoniasis. Study Design: Retrospective chart review of gynecologic visits to the jail medical clinic and comparison of trichomoniasis surveillance data over a 6-year time period. Results: The minimum prevalence of trichomoniasis infection among 450 female inmates presenting to the medical clinic for gynecologic evaluation was 37%. Most infections were diagnosed early after incarceration, no woman developed a new infection after adequate treatment, and there was no clustering of cases by time or location. Conclusion: There was no evidence to support within-jail acquisition of trichomoniasis. The high rate of trichomoniasis and other STDs among incarcerated women warrant more comprehensive jail-based STD screening programs.

N2  - This chapter identifies the shortcomings found in the language and terms of the settlement, in order to lay the groundwork for alternative methods of raising consciousness and seeking reparation. It describes the settlement language not as a victory but rather as an extension of the failure of justice that marks Huronia's very fraught history. The chapter explains how does the language of the claims process work to re-inscribe systemic forms of injustice? It looks at the structure and language of the settlement and address ways in which the discourse employed may further marginalize the most vulnerable within the class and inadvertently retrench forms of trauma. The chapter explores how the language of the settlement extends harmful discursive institutional practices and may in fact leave open space for institutionalization to reoccur. Given the institutional practices have created and perpetuated systemic violence, it is difficult to imagine what institutionalization 'done right' would entail.

N2  - The objective of this work was to describe the frequency and correlates of handgun ownership and firearm injury experiences among youth in a detention facility. A convenience sample of 89 males detained in the King County Youth Services Center, a short-term holding facility, voluntarily completed an anonymous survey. Results showed that 59% of the youth reported owning a handgun. Firearm experiences included carrying a gun to school (46%); firing at another person (68% of handgun owners); firearm injury to self (27%); death of a close friend or family member to firearm homicide or suicide (35%). Personal safety far exceeded recreational use of guns as motivation for self-arming (52% versus 4%). Handgun ownership was more common among youth who reported problem behaviors. Adjusting for age and controlling for covariation of the problem behaviors, gang membership [odds ratio (OR) 6.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-26.11, committing assault and battery (OR 7.7; 95% CI 2.2-26.8) and selling drugs (OR 3.6; 95% CI 0.99-13.4) were associated with handgun ownership. Our conclusion was that firearm experiences for youth in detention pose health risks equal to or far exceeding other high-risk behaviors in this population.

N2  - For a brief moment in the 1980s, a number of local authorities across England and Wales declared themselves ‘custody free zones’ (Rutherford, 2002), symbolising an intent that children should not be incarcerated for their offending behaviour within the local authority boundary. While this lofty aspiration was not always fulfilled, on occasion it was. More importantly, such declarations can be seen as manifestations of a widespread commitment, extending well beyond those ‘zones’, to the idea that the use of custody for children should be avoided wherever possible. During the course of the decade, that commitment found expression in an unprecedented fall in the number of young people deprived of their liberty by the criminal courts. The 1990s proved to be very different. A sea-change in the treatment of children in conflict with the law led to an escalation in custody every bit as sharp as the decline that had preceded it. This thesis seeks to explain that shift in order to understand the implications for practice if the imprisonment of children is to be reduced. The explanatory account is set against a longer term background of social, economic and political change that yielded what Garland (2002) has characterised as the ‘crisis of penal modernism’. It invokes what Foucault (1991) calls a ‘history of the present’ in which patterns of incarceration since the late 1960s are analysed to shed light on the systemic determinants of the current high level of youth custody. Local variations in the use of child imprisonment are also interrogated in the context of the historical experience to ascertain the nature of political, systemic and cultural factors that are consistent with lower rates of detention. The thesis concludes that the recent rise in custody cannot be understood in isolation: the same underlying dynamic that fuelled the carceral explosion impacted equally on other aspects of the youth justice system; and necessitated a significant cultural shift on the part of the those who might previously have been expected to resist the use of detention. Without an understanding of these corresponding changes, strategies for custody reduction that rely heavily on the provision of ‘robust’ community based alternatives, or those that seek to reduce the population of the secure estate simply by ‘nipping in the bud’ (Straw, 1997) children’s offending, are unlikely to lead to the desired outcome.

N2  - Objective:
To analyze the impact of a psychiatric service in a prison general hospital that refers prisoners with mental disorders to a separate forensic psychiatric hospital (FPH).
Method:
Analysis of data on prison population and referrals to the FPH.
Results:
Despite a 10.9% increase in the overall prison system population over 3 years, referrals from the prison general hospital with the new psychiatric service to the FPH were reduced by 36.5%, whereas referrals from other prisons increased by 120.4%.
Conclusion:
Our results demonstrate the efficiency of the new primary health care approach.

N2  - In a prison in Victoria, Australia, our objectives were contact tracing of inmates and staff at
risk of exposure to an identified index case; and to determine risk factors for prevalent and
incident infection. Inmates and staff who were potentially exposed to the index case were
screened with a Mantoux skin test and a questionnaire. Inmate movements within the prison
were compared to movements of the index case. Logistic regression was used to determine risk
factors for infection. The index case had smear positive, cavitating pulmonary tuberculosis
(TB), which was undiagnosed for 3 months. This was the period of potential exposure. The
prevalence of positive skin test reactions in 190 inmates and staff at the prison was 10%.
Significant predictors of a positive skin test were being an inmate (odds ratio (OR) 15·5), older
age (OR 8·3) and being born overseas (OR 10·7). Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination,
proximity to the index case in various prison sites, duration of incarceration, number of
incarcerations and number of inmates per cell were not significant. There were three recent skin
test conversions from negative to positive, representing a conversion rate of 3·5%. We did not
find evidence of significant transmission of TB from a single index case. The prevalence of
infection in this Australian prison was lower than published rates in other countries. Better
prison conditions and different demographics of prison inmates in Australia may explain these
differences.

N2  - With explosive growth in prison populations, deteriorating conditions "inside," and a large number of mentally disordered felons, correctional mental health programs are inundated with demands for services. Based on the author's firsthand survey of state prisons, inmate responses to the harsh conditions are described and a link is suggested between childhood traumas of inmates and the traumas they experience in prison. Implications for correctional mental health services, as well as correctional policy in general, are offered.

N2  - A survey was conducted in which 180 randomly selected male prisoners ages 18 to 44 were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and other questionnaires. A comparison was made with 1,006 similarly aged male residents of Edmonton who were interviewed using the same instruments.
Compared to the general population, prisoners were less likely to be married and were less well educated. There was a higher proportion of Native Indians in the prison sample and lower proportions of Oriental and other racial groups. Prisoners were twice as likely to have a lifetime psychiatric disorder compared with the general population, and all individual disorders investigated were more common in the prison population. Six month prevalence showed even greater rates compared with the general population, indicating recent symptoms. The number of individual disorders per prisoner was also higher than for the general population. Lifetime suicide attempts were seven times more frequent in prisoners than in the general population.

N2  - The prevalence of tuberculosis in the Antananarivo prison is 16 times higher than that in the general population of Madagascar. We compared the clustering of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains within and outside the prison and studied the transmission of strains in the prison.
M. tuberculosis strains isolated in 1994 to 1995 from 146 prisoners and from 260 nonprisoner patients from Antananarivo were typed using the genetic markers IS
6110 and direct repeat. We compared the strains isolated from prisoners and nonprisoners and found that the clustering rate was higher within (58.9%) than outside the prison (40%) suggesting that the transmission rate was higher in prison. Of the 146 incarcerated patients, 82 were grouped into 22 clusters. We checked for possible tuberculosis transmission between prisoners with identical strains by epidemiological investigation of the various prison clusters. We found that 9.5% of the incarcerated patients could have been sources of infection and that only 15.1% could have been infected in the prison. One hundred and twenty-seven prison patients were new cases. Epidemiological data suggested that 37% of them resulted from a reactivation of an old infection, due to poor living conditions or recent transmission from an index case outside the prison.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: An investigation was conducted to determine whether ongoing transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was occurring in a California state prison. METHOD: Prison pharmacy records were used to identify cases of active tuberculosis (TB). RESULTS: Ten of the 18 cases of active TB treated at the facility during 1991 were diagnosed at the prison that same year (an incidence of 184 per 100,000). Three inmates were infectious for a total of 7 months while imprisoned. The prevalence of TB skin test-positivity among inmates was 30%, and the incidence of new infection attributable to incarceration was 5.9 per 100 inmates per year. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of M. tuberculosis may be occurring in the California prison system.

N2  - This study examined the effects of postrelease transitional therapeutic community treatment on the drug use and employment rates of drug involved prisoners in the Delaware corrections system followed for up to 5 years after release. A comparison group received standard postrelease supervision. Abstinence rates were 32.2% in the treatment group and 9.9% in the no-treatment group, and the treatment group had a higher overall proportion of time free of drug use. Time to relapse was a mean of 28.8 months in the treatment group versus 13.2 months in the no-treatment group. Relapse was defined as any use of any drug and was confirmed by urinalysis. Positive effects were seen even for those who did not complete treatment. The treatment group had a significantly higher rate of employment after leaving work release (54.6%) than did the no-treatment group (45.4%). Treatment during the transitional period between prison and community showed substantial and persistent benefits even for a cohort marked with extensive criminal history, low rates of marital bonds, and substantial unemployment.

N2  - This study estimated the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serological markers among inmates and evaluated inmates' compliance with an HBV immunization programme. During the mandatory consultation at the sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic of the Marseille Prison (HIV counselling, and syphilis/HIV screening), physicians offered serological testing (anti-HBs, anti-HBc, HbsAg, anti-HIV) and Engerix B vaccination to each entrant. The number participating in the survey is 391/411 (89%); 75% were aged 18 to 35 years and 79% were men; 42% reported having had multiple sexual partners during the last 12 months. Report of an intravenous drug user (IDU) sexual partner was more frequent among women than men (22% vs 8%). Injecting drug use over lifetime was reported by 23%; 27% declared having shared their injection equipment during the last 12 months. 124/267 (32%) had an HBV marker: anti-HBs only (immunized): 2.3%; anti-HBs and anti-HBc : 21.7%; anti-HBc only: 6.4%; HBsAg : 1.3%. The HIV seroprevalence was 6% (21% among IDUs). This survey underlines the high HBV and HIV seroprevalence among prisoners and the high proportion of inmates at risk for these infections. There is an urgent need for immunization and education programmes in this population. It demonstrates an HBV immunization programme is feasible and accepted by inmates and staff members.

N2  - High rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among jail and prison inmates suggest that HIV prevention efforts should focus on incarcerated populations. Overcrowding, the high prevalence of injection drug use, and other high-risk behaviors among inmates create a prime opportunity for public health officials to affect the course of the HIV epidemic if they can remedy these problems. Yet, along with the opportunity, there are certain obstacles that correctional institutions present to public health efforts. The various jurisdictions have differing approaches to HIV prevention and control. Whether testing should be mandatory or voluntary, whether housing should be integrated or segregated by HIV serostatus, and whether condoms, bleach, or clean needles should be made available to the prisoners, are questions hotly debated by public health and correctional officials. Even accurate assessment of risk-taking within the institutions leads to controversy, as asking questions could imply acceptance of the very behaviors correctional officials are trying to prevent. Education and risk-reduction counseling are the least controversial and most widely employed modes of prevention, but the effectiveness of current prevention efforts in reducing HIV transmission in this high-risk population is largely undetermined.

N2  - In a molecular investigation into the outbreak of HIV in Glenochil during the first 6 months
of 1993, we previously demonstrated that 13 out of the 14 HIV positive inmates were infected
with a virtually identical strain, and discounted 2 others as potential sources. Here we
investigate a further 8 potential contacts and 4 potential sources which were identified in the
companion paper [1]. We were able to examine viral sequence from all but one of these 12
and results have revealed them to be distinct both from each other and the original 14. Thus,
despite an intensive follow-up investigation, we have been unable to identify any further HIV
infections that might have been part of the 1993 outbreak. It is possible that persons who were
infected at that time remain undetected; however this and the companion report strongly
suggest that if this were the case the likely numbers would be few.

N2  - The objective of this study was to examine prescription and acceptance of
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
(PCP) prophylaxis in jail and at release. A retrospective cross sectional design was
used, by record review, of 77 inmates receiving HIV-related care in the San Francisco
City and County Jail and released to the community in 1997. Average CD4 cell count
was 335/µl. Fifteen had undectable HIV RNA, and average viral load was 19,826
copies/ml. Fifty-eight per cent were put on ART in jail. Lower CD4 cell count was
associated with ART (P=0.017). All inmates with CD4 cell counts less
than 200/µl received PCP prophylaxis. According to 1996 guidelines, 72% of those
eligible for ART were on therapy. Of 24 inmates released on ART, 71% followed medical
advice and picked up medication at release. HIV care in the San Francisco Jail met
high standards and exceeded levels reported in other populations.

N2  - Abstract The use and abuse of inhalants continue to be among the most pernicious, curious, and least understood of drug use behaviors. The purpose of this study was to identify specific subgroups of adolescents based on their reasons for using inhalants. Data regarding reasons for using inhalants were examined using latent profile analysis. A three-class solution exhibited the best fit with the data. Although validation analysis revealed that the classes did not differ on demographic characteristics, classes exhibited significant differences across numerous clinical measures, including anxiety, problems associated with using substances, global symptom severity, and number of different types of inhalants used. Results indicate heterogeneity for reasons for use of inhalants and associated psychological distress. Findings may provide clues to future taxonomic development of inhalant abuse phenomena and prevention.

N2  - Abstract Psychosocial functioning and criminal thinking of methamphetamine-using inmates were examined before and after their completion of primary treatment in three in-prison drug treatment programs (one “outpatient” and two different modified therapeutic communities [TCs]). The sample consisted of 2,026 adult male inmates in 30 programs in Indiana. Data included background, psychosocial functioning, criminal thinking, and therapeutic engagement indicators. Multilevel repeated measures analysis was used to evaluate changes during treatment, and multilevel covariate analysis adjusted for sample differences in tests of between-treatment differences. Significant improvements were found for all three treatments, but the two modified TCs showed significantly better progress than did outpatient treatment housed among the general prison population. Significant predictors of treatment progress included baseline psychosocial functioning and background, wherein higher psychosocial functioning and lower criminal thinking orientation predicted stronger therapeutic engagement. However, treatment engagement level was found to mediate during-treatment improvement and initial criminal thinking.

N2  - The study was designed to evaluate the impact of education on AIDS knowledge among prison inmates in Maputo, Mozambique. A 6-month follow-up study was carried out in 1993 among 300 prisoners. A knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire regarding AIDS and STD was administered to each subject as part of the intake medical examination and after an educational intervention provided by 30 prisoner 'activists'. A large proportion of prisoners had high risk behaviours (65% had 2 or more sexual partners per month and 39% had a history of STD) and low AIDS knowledge at incarceration. Statistically significant increases in knowledge occurred after the intervention. Prisoners with less formal education had a poorer performance on the initial questionnaire (43% vs 69% P <0.00001) and had a greater improvement after the intervention (41% vs 24%, P <0.00001). The results demonstrate that educational interventions involving peer health educators contribute positively to the acquisition of knowledge among prisoners.

N2  - Using data collected from a 1999 nationwide survey of 700 incarcerated drug users in Taiwan, this article compares gender differences with respect to childhood experiences, family characteristics, drug use patterns, and criminal histories. The results from both bivariate and logistic regression analyses document some gender differences and offer tentative support for feminist views. Overall, female drug offenders in Taiwan were more likely to have spouses with alcohol or drug use-associated problems, experience physical or sexual abuse, grow up in non-two-parent households, and hold temporary and stereotypical female jobs, including prostitution. Compared to men, although female drug offenders reported earlier involvement in criminal activities, they were less violent and had fewer prior arrests. As for sources, women relied on friends or acquaintances to procure their drugs. No gender differences were identified with respect to illicit drug type or duration and frequency of use.

N2  - Abstract Community-based substance abuse treatment for offenders has been shown to reduce both substance use and recidivism. One strategy to ensure treatment availability for offenders is to have each state's Department of Corrections (DOC) fund treatment directly. Purchasing treatment implies regulation, but DOC as both a purchaser and regulator of community-based services has been underexamined. This national survey of administrators from the Single State Authority (SSA) and DOC in each state found DOCs purchase treatment in 35 states, with most states purchasing it directly from community-based providers utilizing a variety of funding sources. Fewer states reported DOCs purchased ancillary services than SSAs (68% vs. 81%). Although both DOCs and SSAs had workforce and program requirements, there were differences within and between states. Most (41/42) SSA administrators reported a strong relationship with DOC. This report represents the first step in describing the availability, mechanisms, and regulations of these two publicly funded community-based treatment systems.

N2  - Objective
To investigate the symptomatology of severe psychopathology reported by male incarcerated self-mutilators.
Method
Comparisons were made with a nonmutilating incarcerated group and a nonincarcerated, nonmutilator group.
Results
A distinctive pattern of symptomatology emerged. Self-mutilators evidenced a wide range of elevated scores on general measures of psychological/psychiatric symptoms, particularly depression and hostility. Aspects of hostility that distinguished self-mutilators from other groups included the urge to act out hostile feelings, critical feelings towards others, paranoid feelings of hostility and guilt. Self-mutilators demonstrated substantial problems with substance abuse, particularly alcohol.
Conclusion
A pattern of passive-aggressive, schizoid and avoidant personality styles distinguished self-mutilators from other groups.

N2  - This dissertation describes the transformation of mental illness in nineteenth-century Mexico through the prism of Mexico City's insane asylums, the intellectual landscape which shaped the emergence of a modern medical profession and the experiences of asylum patients. I argue that throughout a period when physicians and public health officials were trying to seize control of Mexico City's hospitals and asylums as part of a broader effort to secularize, modernize and rationalize medical care, ordinary people had their own uses for these institutions and continued to assert their rights to free medical care and social assistance. My research draws on an array of archival materials (e.g. patients' letters, hospital and asylum records, doctors' reports, government decrees, and medical school records) and printed sources (e.g. medical theses, journals and newspapers) and is the first study of Mexico's mental institutions which focuses on the experiences of mental patients and physicians and analyzes the ways that definitions of mental illness emerged out of interactions between doctors and patients in the asylum setting. It examines the circumstances that provoked confinement, the role that families and communities played in the process, and how perceptions of class, race, gender and ethnic identity influenced the diagnostic process, but not always in predictable ways. This study challenges the perspective of historians who argue that asylums were simply a feature of an expanding "carceral archipelago" intended to contain, control, reform and discipline the poor. Treating the asylum as a distinctive institution which continued to embody the principles of colonial medical charity, my research has shown that the character of Mexican asylums was shaped by the needs and desires of society in general, and did not simply reflect those of an expanding welfare state and its professionals. This study thus helps bridge the gap between the historiography of medicine and that of Mexican social, political and cultural history.

N2  - The present study examined the level of knowledge and understanding of Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP) treatment therapy among heterosexual and non-heterosexual inmates (prisoners) with HIV-infection. This study seeks to determine if any differences exist between HIV-positive inmates based on sexual orientation, with reference to PCP treatment therapy. It is our contention that this effort will provide health professionals with valuable insight regarding delivering expanded care for HIV-infected individuals in incarcerated settings. The participants for this study were 99 HIV-positive inmates recruited between May and June 1995. These individuals were drawn from a list of all HIV/AIDS prisoners at the facility. More than 56% of the sample admitted their preferred sexual orientation as heterosexual compared to 43.4% non-heterosexual. More non-heterosexual seropositive inmates were likely to report PCP was preventable (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.56, 2.42), as well as noting its contagious attributes (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.90, 2.21). Furthermore, non-heterosexual inmates were more likely to report they were taking prescribed medications for their infections (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.76, 2.36) and that they knew the names of the prescriptions they were taking (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.59, 2.14). Regardless of sexual orientation, it is consistent with the research that HIV-positive individuals may engage in risky sexual behaviour that may place non-infected individuals at risk of contracting the virus. Prison provides an opportunity to provide education to multiple at-risk populations.

N2  - Basal cortisol levels were compared in prisoners convicted of violent crimes, in men previously convicted of violent crimes but currently not in prison, in non-violent alcoholics, and in randomly selected control males. Most of the violent men were diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (DSM-III-R 301.70). Morning, afternoon, and evening levels of plasma cortisol were assessed after a minimum alcohol abstinence of 24 h. The imprisoned violent men had significantly lower cortisol levels than the unimprisoned. which may reflect their prolonged alcohol abstinence and/or habituation to chronic stress. The unimprisoned violent men were heavy drinkers and their elevated sober-state cortisol may reflect temporary alcohol withdrawal or acute stress. We suggest that variations in basal cortisol are influenced more by environmental factors than by violent predisposition or antisocial personality disorder.

N2  - Objective
To measure the extent and outcome of HIV antibody testing at reception into Australian prisons.
Design
Cross‐sectional survey at reception into prison.
Participants and setting
People received into Australian prisons from 1991 to 1997.
Main outcome measures
Number of people tested for HIV infection and prevalence of diagnosed HIV infection.
Results
In 1991–1997, HIV antibody testing was carried out for 72% of prison entrants in Australia; the percentage tested declined significantly from 76% in 1991 to 67% in 1997 (P<0.001). In New South Wales, the percentage of entrants tested at reception into prison dropped from almost 100% in 1991–1994 to 45% in 1997, whereas in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia the extent of testing increased significantly (P<0.001). HIV prevalence was 0.2% among people received into Australian prisons in 1991–1997, and did not differ by sex. Most people with HIV infection (242/378; 64%) received into prison in 1991–1997 had been diagnosed at a previous entry; 136 people (36% of the total number of diagnoses) were newly diagnosed at reception into prison.
Conclusions
A national monitoring system in place from 1991 indicates generally high rates of HIV antibody testing and a low prevalence of HIV infection among people entering Australian prisons. In each year, people not previously known to the prison health service to have HIV infection were received into prison, indicating continuing HIV infection in the population entering Australian prisons.

N2  - The present study investigated the relationship between crime and substance abuse in a sample of 133 consecutively evaluated male prisoners. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, we assessed the prevalence of various forms of substance abuse in this population and attempted to judge whether substance abuse played a role in the index crime which has led to the present incarceration. In addition, we assessed whether there was a relationship between the nature of substance dependence and the type of crime committed, whether sexual, violent, or non-violent. Among the 133 prisoners, 95% obtained a diagnosis of dependence on one or more substances. Fifty-eight percent of the inmates reported that they were acutely intoxicated with one or more substances at the time they committed the index crime and an additional 6% were withdrawing from a substance at the time of the crime. There was no significant correlation between the type of substance abuse diagnosis and the type of crime committed. Similarly, there was no significant correlation between the number of individuals who reported they were intoxicated at the time of the offense and die type of crime committed.

N2  - This study compared sex differences in theoretically relevant cognitive–behavioral treatment concepts in a sample of 1,189 male and 300 female offenders participating in a prison-based substance abuse treatment program. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the differences between men and women in the areas of motivation, self-efficacy, and coping styles. The results show that the women reported a greater recognition of having a substance use problem, less self-efficacy to remain abstinent in high-risk situations, and greater reliance on the coping strategies of seeking support, accepting responsibility, and escaping as compared with the men. The recognition of potential sex differences in the context of a theoretically driven treatment for substance users is discussed.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term of children who had been inpatients in a child psychiatry unit. Fifty children, who were consecutive admissions to a Dublin inpatient child psychiatry unit between November 1978 and July 1980; were followed up 16 years later. We obtained some direct information on 33 subjects; of these, 4 subjects had died and 11 subjects (33%) were living abroad. A poor outcome as defined by imprisonment, adult psychiatric disorder or unemployment was in 18 of the 24 subjects (79%) on whom this information available. We conclude that support and increased availability of services post discharge are needed.

N2  - The violence victimization histories of pregnant incarcerated women were studied in relation to those of pregnant health department patients in North Carolina. Prisoners were twice as likely as health department patients to have experienced both physical and sexual violence compared to no violence, and over three times more likely to have experienced both types of violence compared to only one type. Implications for research and program development are noted.

N2  - The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) symbolized a comprehensive change to the nation's welfare system. Despite several provisions within PRWORA that focus on the use of illegal drugs, few studies have attempted to identify the prevalence of illegal drug use among welfare recipients. Moreover, no scholarly works have compared rates of drug use in welfare-receiving populations to those of non-welfare-receiving populations with an objective measure of drug use. In the current study, urine specimens were collected from 1,572 arrestees interviewed through Houston's Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program in 1999. Drug positive rates are compared between welfare-receiving arrestees (n = 116), non-welfare receiving arrestees living below the poverty level (n = 539), and non-welfare receiving arrestees living above the poverty level (n = 917). Welfare-receiving arrestees were more likely to be female, older, less educated, and to test positive for opiates and benzodiazepines than the other subgroups. Implications for welfare reform policy are discussed in light of the current findings.

N2  - Objective: To identify predictors of HIV-infection in injecting drug users upon incarceration. Patients and methods: We studied 639 IDU or ex-IDU prisoners admitted to a provincial prison of Northwestern Spain between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 1995. Each was interviewed by health personnel and tested for HIV-infection (ELISA followed by immunoblot confirmation in positive cases). Statistical analysis was based on logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of HIV-infection was 46.9% (95% CI: 43.1%-50.8%). No decreasing tendency in annual prevalence of HIV-infection was observed (p = 0.88); however, for those incarcerated for the first time prevalence fell from 38% in 1991 to 19% in 1995 (p = 0.20). Gypsies (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23-0.80) and prisoners who were older upon first incarceration (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90-0.99) were associated with lesser risk of HIV-infection. Women (OR: 2.17;95% CI: 1.29-3.65), older prisoners (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02-1.11), those with multiple incarceration histories (OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11) and long-term prisoners (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02) were associated with higher risk. Conclusions: The high prevalence of HIV-infection, especially in women, younger prisoners, repeat offenders and long-term prisoners, suggests that prevention measures directed toward the most marginal IDU have not been very effective. Harm-reduction programs must be made to reach the IDU population, both in and outside prison walls.

N2  - During 1995, a prison with an 1,800-inmate capacity that incarcerated similar to 6,000 persons per year reported 24 inmates and one staff member with new, positive tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), identified during routine annual screenings. From January to July 1996, the same prison reported 123 inmates and eight of 493 staff members with new positive TSTs during routine annual skin testing and a specially scheduled June 1996 inmate screening (an increase of 400% over the number of positive TSTs in 1995). None of the inmates or staff had had active tuberculosis diagnosed during the 1995-1996 period. An investigation was undertaken to determine the source of the tuberculous infection.

N2  - The intravenous drug use behaviour and HIV risk reduction strategies used by a group of Scottish inmates prior to prison, during imprisonment and as expected after release was investigated. From a sample of 559 inmates (480 males and 79 females) 27.5% were involved in IVDU prior to imprisonment, 7.7% on at least one occasion during a period of imprisonment and 14.7% expected to do so after release. Prior to imprisonment 17,3% had shared needles, 5.7% at some time during imprisonment and 4.3% expected to do so after release. Some form of HIV risk reduction strategies were practised by the majority of IVDU inmates prior to imprisonment, during imprisonment and were expected to continue after release. The most at risk inmates were those who continued to share injecting equipment without reduction and without sterilizing. The reduction in IVDU and needle sharing during imprisonment in comparison to prior to imprisonment was paralleled by a self‐perceived reduction of personal risk from HIV during imprisonment.

N2  - With rates of adolescent tobacco use steadily increasing over the past 20 years, assisting youth to quit, particularly those youth most susceptible to tobacco use, has become a national focus. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine and profile the smoking patterns of a small sample (n = 37) of juvenile offenders in Texas. In contrast to anecdotal reports, the sample group from this study did not differ clinically from the general population of adolescent tobacco users. Importantly, the study participants indicated previous attempts to stop smoking. The authors conclude that delinquent youth may be responsive to cognitive behavioral smoking cessation programs that also address the management of peer networks.

N2  - Objective: This project was developed to evaluate the use of and satisfaction with Veteran's Affairs (VA) medical services and disability benefits among surviving elderly prisoners of war (POWs) in South Carolina. Method: A single-assessment quantitative survey strategy was implemented to learn more about the service use patterns and satisfaction with care of two groups of male former POWs (N = 87): those who were members of a national POW service organization and those who were not. Results: Data show that the majority of these POWs had used the VA for medical care in the previous year, received disability compensation through the VA, and were satisfied with VA primary care medical services. Furthermore, differences between these two POW groups were minimal. Conclusions: Results provide preliminary evidence that many former POWs rely heavily upon the VA for provision of primary medical and specialty care and disability compensation and that POWs are generally satisfied with the VA services and benefits they receive.

N2  - Objective: To consider the health profile of a sample of young, largely male Australians as assessed on their admission to a New South Wales Juvenile Justice Detention Centre.
Method: A retrospective analysis of primary care nurse health records for 100 sequential admissions.
Results: Of the 97 males and three females (mean age = 15.9 years), 30 were Aboriginal and 39 did not live with either parent at the time of admission. Respiratory illness, such as bronchitis and asthma were common. These diagnoses were overshadowed by histories of significant physical injury. The sample was at high risk of sexually transmitted disease. Forty‐six per cent had prior contact with a mental health professional, 26% reported they had thought of suicide and 9% reported having attempted suicide. There was a high prevalence of substance abuse.
Conclusion: The health of these young Australians is at risk from every perspective. Improving the quality of their health assessments is an important issue for the clinicians who attend them as individuals and for policy makers who aim to reduce the considerable social and economic cost of juvenile crime. The discussion of these results from one centre has revealed opportunities to make such improvements. There is a need for a gathering of expertise to address the issue, preferably on a national basis.

N2  - The population of a women's prison (n=92) was screened for psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, a Recent Stressful Life Events questionnaire and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. High levels of symptoms of psychological distress were recorded. Distress was correlated with recent stressful life events and was more severe in women awaiting trial. Fifty-three per cent of the prisoners were diagnosed as current cases of a psychiatric disorder and the most frequent diagnoses were adjustment disorder with depressed mood and personality disorders. Lifetime prevalence of psychoactive substance use disorders was 54 per cent. Aboriginal women were over-represented in this prison population. A follow-up survey after 4 months showed no fall in the prevalence of psychological distress and psychiatric morbidity.

N2  - The present study examined the consequences of being a self-reported transsexual male and HIV risk behaviours in a state penal system. The specific research question was whether or not sexual orientation of inmates influences the level to which they evidence HIV risk behaviours. A total of 153 participants volunteered to participate in the study of which 31 described themselves as being transsexual. Based on risk ratios and using transsexual inmates (TIs) as the reference group, they were 13.7 times more likely to have a main sex partner while in prison [95% CI=5.28, 35.58]. Moreover, TIs were 5.8 times more likely than non-transsexual inmates (NTIs) to report having more than one sex partner while in prison [95% CI=2.18, 15.54]. It is obvious from these findings that TIs require more preventive support than their NTI confederates. In addition to TIs being protected from assault and battery by NTIs, they need social support and carefully developed preventive informational materials.

N2  - 434 male and 145 female prisoners were available to participate in crosssectional, voluntary anonymous HIV surveillance (using saliva samples) with linked self-completion questionnaire at HMP (Her Majesty's Prison) Perth on 17 May and at HMP Cornton Vale on 18 May 1995. Three hundred and four men (70%) and 136 women (94%) completed a risk-factor questionnaire and 304 and 135 samples were received for HIV antibody testing. Two hundred and eighty-two and 132 questionnaires passed logical checks. Six saliva samples from Perth (all injectors) out of 304 and none from Cornton Vale out of 134 tested were HIV antibody positive. Four were presumptively from known HIV-infected male inmates; the other 2 were local men, under 26 years, who began injecting in 1989-91, and both reported having had a recent HIV test. Overall HIV prevalence was estimated at 2% compared to a known prevalence of 1.4% (6/434), giving a 1.5 ratio of overall: disclosed HIV prevalence at HMP Perth. HIV prevalence was estimated at 7% (6/82) for injector-participants and 14% (5/35) for local injector participants. At Cornton Vale, where both known HIV-infected inmates abstained, overall and disclosed HIV prevalence were equal at 1.4%. At Perth Prison, 29% of prisoners had injected drugs (82/278); 85% of injector-inmates reported having injected inside (some) prison and 31% (25/80) had started to inject while inside, 7 during their present sentence. Of all 21 injector-inmates who first injected after 1991, 10 hadstarted to inject inside, including one of 69 male inmateswho had never been inside before. The corresponding figures for Cornton Vale, where 46% of inmates were injectors (58/132), were that 57% of injector-inmates had injected inside (32/56) but only one woman, for whom this was not her first sentence, had started to inject inside. Twenty-eight per cent of male prisoners (78/277) and 57% of male injector-inmates (47/82) had had a personal HIV test since January 1993, as had 35% of female prisoners (43/124) and 57% of female injector-inmates (30/53). A much higher proportion of Glasgow's female prisoners (64%: 38/60) were injectors than of women prisoners from the Edinburgh, Dundee and Fife area (21%: 5/26) or from elsewhere (34%: 15/45). Rape was reported by 23% of women (30/130). Women who had been raped had a more polarized distribution of male sexual partners (none to 2 plus) in the year before sentencing than other women and were more likely to report anal sex (11/30 vs 11/100, P< 0.001). Prostitution had been engaged in by 19% of female injector-inmates (11/57) and was acknowledged by one other woman. However, only 5% of women (6/130) reported ever having been treated for an STD.

N2  - Empirical work on psychopathology and delinquency requires concise and specific instruments. The Weinberger Adjustment Inventory (WAI), was correlated with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) using a sample of incarcerated adolescent males (N = 178). The distress dimension of the WAI was Significantly and positively associated with scales 2, 4 and 7 of the MMPI. The restraint dimension was significantly and positively associated with the Lie and K scales of the MMPI. Distress and restraint were distinct dimensions. The WAI may be a brief and helpful personality measure, determining responses to conflict and subjective stress in delinquents with poor reading skills and other special education impairments. The length of the WAI makes it especially suitable for populations such as incarcerated adolescent males who exhibit short attention spans and frequent episodes of noncompliant and resistant behavior.

N2  - We assessed the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) by cervicovaginal lavage and Southern blot and inquired about behavioral risk factors for cervical disease and sexually transmitted diseases by interview in 114 female detainees at a large New York City jail. Of the women screened, 8% had abnormal Pap smears, 35% had HPV, 7% had gonorrhea, and 22% had serologic syphilis. Given the high rates of HPV infection and cervical cytology, Pap smears should be a routine intake procedure for incarcerated women.

N2  - The absolute and relative frequency of suicides in jails and prisons in Austria over the 50 years from 1947 to 1996 is described. Important legislational changes regarding the criminal justice system are discussed with regard to possible consequences for the incidence of prisoners' suicides. Within the five decades a significant increase in the absolute numbers of jail and prison suicides was evident in spite of the considerable decrease in the total inmate population. Therefore, the suicide rate of inmates of correctional facilities increased significantly. Possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed in relation to changes of the criminal law.

N2  - This paper presents an assessment of the long-term mental sequelae of prolonged stress due to political persecution and imprisonment in the German Democratic Republic. Fifty-five former political prisoners with enduring psychiatric disorders were examined retrospectively in an exploratory study. The patientsʼ experiences before, during, and after imprisonment were investigated using a semistructured interview. Psychopathological symptoms were assessed on clinical and self-rating scales; diagnostic classification was conducted according to DSM-III-R. The patients had experienced serious trauma, including psychological torture, long-term imprisonment, and solitary confinement. We diagnosed a characteristic syndrome involving symptoms of depression and anxiety with vegetative complaints and increased arousal. In 35 (64%) patients, the symptoms persisted over an extended period without improvement. This syndrome resembles psychiatric disorders found after other forms of political persecution. It may be concluded that prolonged individually experienced political stress situations, even if they are not life-threatening, may have long-term mental sequelae.

N2  - There is no data on HIV seroprevalence among prisoners in Togo.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among prisoners in Togo from November 2011 to January 2012. The study population was included by selecting the most densely populated prison in each of the six Togo regions, and by including prisoners (at least18years of age and having been in prison for more than 30days) on a voluntary basis. HIV prevalence was estimated with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
One thousand three hundred and fourty-two prisoners were included in the study. Their median age was 28years, (IQR 25–33years) and 39 (2.9%) were women. The median time spent in the prison was 10months, interquartile range [4–24months]. HIV testing was accepted by 96.0%. HIV seroprevalence in prisons was 4.3%, 95 CI% [3.2–5.5%]. Few prisoners (2.9%) reported having had sex in prisons. The only factor associated with HIV infection was gender with an HIV seroprevalence of 14.3% for women compared to 4.0% for men (P=0.003).
The prevention and the management of HIV infection should be a priority in Togolese prisons. This requires implementing healthcare facilities in prisons.
Il n’existe aucune donnée sur la séroprévalence du VIH chez les prisonniers au Togo. L’objectif de cette étude était d’estimer la séroprévalence du VIH au sein de la population carcérale du Togo.
Une étude descriptive transversale a été réalisée chez les prisonniers au Togo de novembre 2011 à janvier 2012. La population d’étude a été constituée en sélectionnant dans chacune des six régions du pays la prison la plus peuplée, puis en invitant dans chaque prison sélectionnée, les détenus (âgés de 18ans et plus et dont le séjour en prison était supérieur à 30jours) à participer sur une base volontaire. La prévalence du VIH a été estimée avec son intervalle de confiance (IC) à 95 %.
Mille trois cent quarante-deux prisonniers ont participé à l’enquête. L’âge médian était de 28ans, (EIQ 25–33ans) et 39 détenus (2,9 %) étaient des femmes. La durée médiane d’incarcération était de dix mois. L’acceptation du test du VIH était de 96,0 % et la prévalence du VIH dans les prisons était de 4,3 %, IC 95 % [3,2–5,5 %]. Peu de prisonniers (2,9 %) ont rapporté avoir eu des rapports sexuels dans les prisons. Le seul facteur associé à l’infection à VIH était le genre féminin avec une prévalence de 14,3 % chez les femmes versus 4,0 % chez les hommes (p=0,003).
La prévention et la prise en charge des personnes infectées par le VIH doivent être une priorité dans les prisons du Togo et cela nécessite l’équipement des structures de soins dans les prisons.

N2  - OBJECTIVE--To study a group of injecting drug users to establish the degree of illicit drug use in prisons, the prevalence of risk behaviours for HIV infection, and the uptake of treatment for drug dependency with drugs within the prison system. DESIGN--Anonymous, self administered, questionnaire. SETTING--Two drug agencies in central London; one operating a scheme for exchanging needles, and the other offering drug advice and information. SUBJECTS--50 (42 Men, eight women) self selected injecting drug users (mean age 31.2 (range 21-42)), all of whom had been held in custody at some time since 1982. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Details about periods served in custody since 1982; the number of respondents who took drugs (orally or by injection), either illicitly or prescribed, while in prison and the types of substances taken; the respondents' sexual activity in prison and between periods in custody. RESULTS--The average time spent in custody before the study was 20.6 months (range 1-72). Most prosecutions were directly or indirectly related to drug taking. 47 Of the 50 respondents reported taking at least one illicit drug while in custody; 33 by injection, 26 of whom had shared injecting equipment. 30 Had been treated for drug dependency by the prescribing of drugs while in prison. While in custody, one woman and four men (with a mean of seven (range 2-16) male partners) had had sex. Between periods spent in custody, men reported having a mean of eight (range 0-90) female partners and women a mean of one (range 0-3) male partner. Three men had had sex with other men, with a mean of six (range 2-11) partners. Since their last period in custody, men had had a mean of two (range 0-18) female partners and women had had a mean of two (range 1-3) male partners. Five men had also had male partners. CONCLUSIONS--A high prevalence of injecting and sexual risk behaviours among injecting drug users within and between periods in custody has been shown. Most of these offenders continued to take drugs while in custody, and just over half not only injected drugs but shared equipment. Some of the male prisoners compounded their risk of HIV infection by engaging in sexual activity with multiple partners. Prisoners who then have multiple sexual partners after release place their partners in the community at particular risk of HIV infection. Although many of the drug users were prescribed drugs for their dependency, limited access to appropriate treatment, counselling, and health education may compound the situation.

N2  - Rapid participatory research and project development is possible within a tightly controlled social context such as a prison. Having gained access, based on trust and mutual respect, external agents may then facilitate significant change. Given adequate support, incarcerated people with HIV/AIDS and limited medical access may be able to develop mutual care, social support and income-generating activities. In the Malaysian context, we estimated in 1998 that up to one-quarter of prisoners with HIV had indicators of significant disease. We estimated that significant indicators remained unrevealed among between one-half and two-thirds of these. Given prevailing conditions, these would probably only be amenable to peer-based care.

N2  - The Joint Tuberculosis Committee of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommends that all new prison staff be screened for tuberculosis (TB) as ‘at risk’ health workers. This study of prisons in the West Midlands area of England shows that there are considerable variations in the practice of TB control amongst prison staff and that the recommendations of the BTS committee are not routinely implemented. The study highlights the need for a routine and robust system of TB surveillance and prevention amongst prison staff which can be applied nationwide.

N2  - La prévalence de l’hépatite C reste élevée en milieu carcéral avec près de 5 % des détenus concernés. Une recommandation ministérielle récente invite à traiter tout les patients infectés par le virus de l’hépatite C (VHC) en détention. Nous rapportons ici l’expérience de notre centre.
Le dépistage du VHC est systématique à l’arrivée en détention. Les patients ainsi dépistés, sont orientés dans un parcours de soins diagnostic et thérapeutique spécialisé. Ainsi, nous avons effectué une étude rétrospective de l’ensemble des patients pris en charge pour une hépatite C chronique au sein de notre établissement, entre le 1er juillet 2014 et 31 janvier 2017.
Sur la période étudiée, 219 patients ont été pris en charge pour une hépatite C. L’âge moyen était de 42,8 ans [24 ; 61] et le sex-ratio (H/F) de 11. Cent quatre vingt huit (85,8 %) patients avaient un antécédent de toxicomanie intraveineuse. Le score de fibrose hépatique se répartissait entre F0-F2 (n=131-60 %), F3 (n=42 – 19 %) et F4 (n=46 – 21 %). Quatre patients présentaient des signes extra hépatique (1 lymphome indolent, 3 cryoglobulinémies). Les génotypes du VHC étaient 1 (115 – 53 %), 2 (20 – 9 %), 3 (53 – 24 %) et 4 (20 – 9 %). Un traitement a été proposé chez 114 patients (52 %), parmi lesquels 33 (28 %) n’ont pas été traités car la durée de leur peine n’était pas suffisamment longue et 2 patients ont refusé le traitement. Les traitements proposés étaient : sofosbuvir (SBV)/NS5A=52 (64 %), SBV/NS5A+ribavirine (RBV)=15 (19 %), SBV+RBV=6 (7,5 %), SBV/NS3/4A = 4 (5 %), SBV+RBV+interferon pegylé=2 (2,5 %). Soixante-dix-neuf patients ont été traités, permettant 29 guérisons (37 %), 13 traitements terminés étaient en attente de la PCR S12 (16 %), 23 traitements sont en cours (29 %). On note deux non-réponses et un suicide avant SVRS12. Aucun effet secondaire n’a été rapporté. Depuis septembre 2016, 23 patients bénéficient d’une prise en charge individuelle avec accompagnement social et médical dans le cadre du projet « Parcours de santé VHC en Ile de France ». Ainsi, ce dispositif permet d’augmenter le nombre de patient pouvant bénéficier d’un traitement.
La prise en charge du VHC en détention est l’opportunité de toucher une population précaire souvent difficile à traiter dans les circuits classiques. Les nouvelles recommandations ministérielles facilitent ainsi la prescription des nouveaux anti-viraux d’action directe, permettant de traiter efficacement un nombre important de détenus. Certains patients n’ont pu être traité à cause d’une impossibilité de suivi et de prise en charge à la libération, justifiant la mise en place d’un dispositif dédié assurant la jonction lors de la sortie de détention.

N2  - The comorbidity of drug abuse and various forms of psychopathology is pervasive and well documented. In particular, the incidence of depression, anxiety, and antisocial personality disorder is high among substance abusers relative to non-drug abusers. Offender populations have a high rate of substance abuse, and some studies suggest that the incidence of psychopathology may be even greater than in order drug using groups. In order to identify specific types of psychopathology as they relate to drug preferences and frequency of use among drug-using offenders, arrestees at the Baltimore City Detention Center were examined. During extensive interviews, drug-abusing arrestees provided information pertaining to their backgrounds, childhood histories, biological relatives, present behaviors, and criminal and drug histories. Additionally, several psychological inventories were administered to evaluate the presence of depression, anxiety, psychopathy, and impulsivity. Results indicate that the frequency with which subjects reported using specific drugs and drug of choice were significantly associated with particular measures of psychopathology. A composite measure of psychopathy was especially related to the frequency of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use. Subjects who reported using cocaine on a frequent basis scored high on measures of hostility and reported committing more property crimes, while violent crimes were more likely to be reported by subjects scoring high on the measure of psychopathy. Other noteworthy findings will be discussed along with the limitations of this study.

N2  - The health care received by prisoners in the area of tissue and organ transplantation is not well discussed or documented. We encountered a prisoner with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia who was a candidate for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and had two HLA-identical siblings who were willing to donate bone marrow. Based on humanitarian, constitutional, and ethical considerations, we suggest that the prisoner (patient) should receive the same health care as individuals who are not incarcerated and that the costs of care should play no greater role for prisoners than for other members of society.

N2  - The prevalence of HIV infection and the incidence of AIDS are higher among prison inmates compared to the general population. Although African Americans and Hispanics constitute similar to 13% and 12.5% of the population, respectively, they are over-represented among the prison population. The current trend in the adult/adolescent AIDS cases among African Americans and Hispanics outpaces that of the white population. The sociodemographic data of HIV/AIDS looks similar to the sociodemographics of U.S. prisons. This suggests that there may be a link between HIV transmission in prison and the current AIDS epidemic in the community. In addition, this high incidence is also a reflection of the high-risk lifestyle of the incarcerated population. High-risk behavior common among the incarcerated and inner city minority communities includes injection drug use, sharing of drugs and drug paraphernalia, and multiple sex partners. HIV transmission risk-reduction efforts such as mandatory screening of inmates, preventive HlV/AIDS education, and appropriate and adequate therapeutic management are essential to curtail the epidemic. However, any HIV/AIDS reduction program for minority communities must include culturally sensitive interventions.

N2  - One hundred and eighty-one inmates in AIDS education courses were surveyed about their risk behaviour and access to disinfectants for syringe cleaning in 1993. Overall, 40% of respondents reported HIV risk behaviour in prison. One-quarter of respondents reported injecting, of whom three-quarters reported sharing syringes in prison. Most respondents who shared syringes reported cleaning them with disinfectants (96%), even though only one-third reported having easy access to disinfectants. One-sixth of respondents reported sharing tattooing equipment, of whom two-thirds reported using a disinfectant to clean the tattoo needle. Few respondents reported fellatio (8%) or anal intercourse (4%) in prison. Although some respondents faced difficulty in obtaining disinfectants, almost all respondents cleaned syringes with bleach when sharing. High levels of risk behaviour in prison might be reduced by methadone maintenance and condom programmes. A trial of strict one-for-one syringe exchange warrants consideration.

N2  - Compulsory urine testing of prisoners for drugs, a control initiative, was introduced in eight prisons in England and Wales early in 1995. Despite no evidence of effectiveness, testing was extended to all prisons in England and Wales by March 1996. We consider the cost of testing.
We combined the costs of refusals, confirmatory tests, punishment of confirmed positives for cannabis or for class A drugs to estimate the average costs of random compulsory drugs testing. These costs were then compared to: i) the healthcare budget for a prison; and ii) the cost of putting in place a credible prisons' drugs reduction programme. We then used Scottish data on incarceration and regional prevalence of injecting drug users to estimate the extent of the injecting drug use problem that prisons face.
Costs per 28 days of the random mandatory drugs testing control initiative in an establishment for 500 inmates where refusal rate is a) 10% or b) nil; and 35% of urine samples test positive, one tenth of them for class A drugs were estimated at between a) £UK22 800 and b) £UK16 000 per 28 days [a) $ US35 100 and b) $ US24 600]. This cost was equivalent to twice the cost of running a credible drugs reduction and rehabilitation programme, and around half the total healthcare expenditure for a prison of 500 which averaged £UK41 114 per 28 days [$ US64 860]. Major cost-generating events were the punishment of refusals–over one third of cost a)–and testing positive for cannabis-over 50% of cost a). In Scotland, around 5% of injecting drug users (IDUs) are incarcerated at any time: 5% of Lothian's drugs care, treatment and prevention costs and 2·5% of its HIV/AIDS prevention budget in 1993–94 amounted to £UK101 300 per annum–or £UK7770 per 28 days ($ US11 970)-and about 35% of monthly MDT costs.
We suggest that 5% of current resources for drugs prevention and treatment and for IDU-targetted HIV/AIDS prevention should be directed towards the prisons because in the prisons, where 5% of the clients are at any time, injectors have less access to harm reduction measures than on the outside.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to test constructs of an enhanced version of the health belief model (HBM) in predicting juvenile delinquents' safer sex intentions. An accessible sample (n = 452) of incarcerated youth between the ages of 13-18 years from a midwestern state were subjects. HBM constructs were measured with an instrument tested for face, content, and construct validity as well as internal reliability. HBM constructs accounted for 28% of the variance in safer sex intentions. The results of this study support the use of the HBM in understanding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behavior in this population. The implications of these results for theory-based HIV prevention among incarcerated youth are presented.

N2  - Empirical estimates of quantile residual life functions can be employed effectively to obtain properties of recidivism and to help screen parametric mixture models. In this manner, the Burr model is demonstrated to be an appropriate model for characterizing recidivism. When applied to certain data, the model suggests that while the observed declining recidivism rate can be explained by population heterogeneity, individual recidivism rates may in fact be increasing. The quantile residual life function approach to modeling recidivism is applied to two often-referenced data sets, as well as to an extensive data set obtained from the State of New York which is new to the criminal justice literature.

N2  - This study tested the viability of auricular acupuncture in prisons for alleviating inmates' symptoms of psychological and physical discomfort and reducing their drug use. The experimental NADA-Acudetox protocol was compared with a non-specific helix control protocol in a randomized trial. Over a period of 18 months, a 4-week, 14-session auricular acupuncture treatment program was offered in two prisons to 163 men and women with self-reported drug use. Among treatment completers, no differences by method were found in self-reported symptoms of discomfort. Drug use occurred in the NADA group but not in the helix group. In contrast, confidence in the NADA treatment increased over time while it decreased for the helix treatment. No significant negative side effects were observed for either method. Participants in both groups reported reduced symptoms of discomfort and improved nighttime sleep. Future research should compare auricular acupuncture to a non-invasive control in order to attempt to disentangle active effects from placebo.

N2  - Since the 1980s, China has experienced major changes in its traditional drug use patterns which included mostly tobacco and alcohol use. The introduction of opium, marijuana, heroin, and cocaine is the most noticeable change. In 1995, there were about 520,000 reported drug users in China and the rate of increase was about 200 percent. During the 1990 Strictly Against Illegal Drug Campaign (Yan Da), the Chinese government implemented a compulsory detoxification plan and a Community Drug Rehabilitation Camp strategy to deal with the diverse aspects of the illegal drug control. This article provides an initial evaluation of the community camp approach to drug detoxification and rehabilitation. Open-ended interviewing schedules were given to two samples from two government sponsored rehabilitation community camps in 1994. These interviews reveal that: 1) the social and cultural reorientation of drug addicts is facilitated by an intensive mass media propaganda; 2) there is a mobilization of the health care and social security systems to provide detoxification, rehabilitation, and employment to drug addicts in a relatively short period of time; 3) “recidivist” addicts and drug traffickers are condemned to a long-term incarceration in work camps; and 4) the camp strategy experiences some problems. Results show that in the two community camps, an average of twelve month's training yielded a rehabilitation rate of 80 percent.

N2  - Abstract
After the occurrence of a case of chickenpox in Switzerland's largest pre-trial prison, protective measures including post-exposure vaccination were implemented, as chickenpox can cause severe complications in adults. Serology for chickenpox was carried out for all contacts of the index case and rapid post-exposure vaccination proposed to all prisoners with a negative history for chickenpox. Susceptibility was found in 14 out of 110 prisoners (12.7%; 95% confidence interval 6.5-18.9). The positive predictive value of a history of chickenpox was 90%. In this predominantly migrant population, susceptibility to chickenpox was approximately 6 times higher than in the general Swiss adult population. Since the attack rate among susceptible household contacts is usually high, preventive measures such as vaccination and quarantine probably allowed containment of the spread of infection.

N2  - Incarcerated adolescents' attributions for drug use were investigated. A new 50-item questionnaire, the Inventory of Drug Taking Situations (IDTS), was used to assess reasons for use. The IDTS yields eight subscales corresponding to risky situations identified by Marlatt and others. On the IDTS, subjects indicate how frequently they used their drug of choice when confronted with each risky situation. The IDTS scales had good internal consistency and higher scores were significantly associated with self-reports of drug use frequency. Furthermore, IDTS scores were most valid for the type of drug the measure was filled out about. Adolescents reported that they tended to use more frequently in response to positive and/or interpersonal experiences, as opposed to negative and/or internal ones. Positive, negative, interpersonal, and internal reasons for use were all equally correlated with frequency of use. In the most heavily drug-involved adolescents, however, negative reasons were more highly correlated with frequency of use than positive reasons. Treatment implications are discussed.

N2  - Female offender populations and females in jail include large proportions of injecting drug users (IDUs), who are at high risk of contracting or transmitting HIV. Women IDUs (n = 165) were recruited and interviewed at New York City's central jail facility for women. The study examined these women's patterns of HIV risk behaviors related to drugs and sex and identified behavioral and attitudinal correlates of HIV serostatus. The women typically used both injectable and non‐injectable drugs prior to arrest, primarily heroin, cocaine powder, crack, and illicit methadone. Self‐reported HIV seropositivity was 43%. Variables correlated with HIV serostatus in the bivariate analysis were: cocaine injection frequency; lifetime injection risk behavior; providing oral sex during male crack use; Hispanic ethnicity; sharing of needles/syringes; sharing of cookers; sharing injection equipment with friends; heroin smoking (negative); injection risk acceptance; peer norms and behavior; lifetime sexual risk behavior; frequency of sex with men; provision of sex for money or drugs; and knowing people with AIDS. The first four variables listed retained statistical significance in a multiple logistic regression analysis. The paper considers the need to tailor AIDS prevention interventions for woman IDUs in jail, including taking into account risk behaviors that occur within frequently reported same‐sex partnerships.

N2  - BACKGROUND. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care recommends that medical screening, including tests for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, be performed by the 14th day after initial booking procedures. Because the average length of stay in detention is usually less than 14 days, most detainees are not screened or treated for asymptomatic communicable diseases. METHODS. In order to determine the incidence and prevalence of syphilis among those booked through a large county jail, a rapid screening procedure to test newly incarcerated inmates and treat those infected was implemented over a 3-week period. RESULTS. Among 6309 detainees eligible for testing during the 3-week period of the study, 129 (2%) were diagnosed with syphilis. During the preceding month when only those reporting symptoms or high-risk behaviors were screened, 20 cases were diagnosed. The sensitivity and predictive value of self-reported risk factors for syphilis infection were low. Among the first 110 diagnosed cases, 17 (15.5%) were released within 3 days and 86 (78%) were released within 6 days. CONCLUSIONS. If screening and treatment for syphilis are delayed until the 14th day after booking, the majority of infected inmates will be released prior to evaluation and treatment. Rapid screening and treatment for selected sexually transmitted diseases are likely to be an effective public health measure when implemented in custody settings.

N2  - Barriers to external communication for incarcerated loved ones affect more than 549,100 individuals incarcerated in jail and over 1.2 million incarcerated in prison yearly in the United States. Loved ones, particularly family members, are often forced to pay exorbitant prices for various communication services lest they lose contact with those behind bars. A 2018 report published by FWD.us estimated that 1 in 2 adults has had an immediate family member incarcerated for at least one night. Approximately 1 in 4 US adults have had a sibling incarcerated, 1 in 5 adults experienced parental incarceration, 1 in 7 adults have had an incarcerated spouse or co-parent, and 1 in 8 adults had their child incarcerated. The financial costs of maintaining contact with incarcerated individuals far outstrip what one would pay to communicate with a non-incarcerated person. For example, according to the Prison Policy Initiative’s annual prison and jail phone rate surveys, a 15-minute in-state prison phone call in 2021 cost an average of $0.15 to $2.10, depending on the state. Depending on the locality, an in-state phone call from jail costs an average of $0.93 to $5.47 per 15-minute call. Video visitation is a new option for communication, allowing visits to occur from external locations. In some jurisdictions, video visits can take place anywhere with a computer and webcam if scheduled in advance with an approved visitor. The costs can be far higher than phone call rates, with a 30-minute video call costing $9.95 in some jurisdictions. Though there are significant benefits—convenience, improved access to loved ones, and reduced recidivism—visitors often report that video calls are impersonal, low-quality, and subject to technology problems that may cut visits short.

N2  - Studies of former prisoners of war (POWs) provide valuable insights into posttraumatic adaptation because they gather information from a large population who survived the traumatic experiences of military captivity. Previous studies of POWs have shown elevated rates of psychiatric symptoms and disorders. This report presents evidence from a longitudinal study of three large, representative, national samples of former POWs. The study finds that depressive symptomatology, as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, is elevated in World War II POWs from the Pacific and European theaters and in Korean conflict POWs. Decades later, depressive symptomatology is found to be strongly associated with prior treatment in captivity. Differences in depressive symptomatology among the three POW groups can be attributed to captivity-related factors and to buffering factors, such as age at capture and education.

N2  - Adolescent boys (N = 128) from a maximum security prison for juvenile offenders were administered a task to assess hostile attributional biases. As hypothesized, these biases were positively correlated with undersocialized aggressive conduct disorder (as indicated by high scores on standardized scales and by psychiatric diagnoses), with reactive-aggressive behavior, and with the number of interpersonally violent crimes committed. Hostile attributional biases were found not to relate to nonviolent crimes or to socialized aggressive behavior disorder. These findings held even when race and estimates of intelligence and socioeconomic status were controlled. These findings suggest that within a population of juvenile offenders, attributional biases are implicated specifically in interpersonal reactive aggression that involves anger and not in socialized delinquency.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to determine whether clustering of suicide occurred in prisoners and detainees in police cells and to describe the characteristics of any clusters identified. DESIGN--Mortality from suicide was examined for evidence of clusters. SETTING--Prisons (1971-1988) and police cells (1980-September 1991) in New Zealand. SUBJECTS--82 male suicides. MAIN RESULTS--There were 38 male suicides in prisons and 44 in police cells over the time periods. Due to the increasing trend in prison suicides, the 1971-1982 and 1983-1988 time periods were examined for evidence of clusters separately. For suicides in police cells the time periods studied were 1980-1982, 1983-1988, and 1989-1991. The event of suicide was treated as a Poisson process with all suicides in a time period used to calculate the mean. Four suicide clusters occurred between 1985 and 1988 in prisons. These did not explain the increased suicide rate over this period. Three clusters of suicide in police cells occurred between 1980 and 1991, which had different characteristics from suicide in prisons in that these three clusters were of longer duration. CONCLUSIONS--The different characteristics of prison and police cell clusters of suicide indicated separate transmission of the contagious component of suicide between these groups. Distinct strategies to reduce clusters of male suicide in custody are required for prisoners and those held in police cells.

N2  - The study covered 52 women, aged 19–30 years, who had previously taken home‐made poppy preparations. In seven of them we diagnosed opium use (F 11.11 according to ICD‐10) and 45 had opium abuse (F 11.21). All were detained in penitentiaries for 2–23 months. The control group consisted of 20 healthy females. A significant frequency of brain stem and extrapyramidal disturbances was found in the opium abuse group. Brain stem signs included tendon anisoreflexia (100–2%), nystagmus (87 5%), ataxia (87 5%) and corneal hyporeflexia (48 7%). Among the most frequent extrapyramidal disturbances were a positive pushing test (90 4%); test with pendular swinging of the legs (85 5%) and hand tremor (82 7%). Statistical analysis revealed a relationship between the degree of extrapyramidal system damage and duration of opiate dependence.

N2  - Objective:
To examine the prevalence of homelessness and its relationship to mental disorder, criminal behaviour, and health care.
Method:
Interview and file data were collected for 790 male admissions to a large, pretrial jail facility over a 12-month period.
Results:
A significant relationship was found between homelessness and severe mental disorder as well as between homelessness and prior psychiatric history. There were no significant differences found between the homeless and the nonhomeless on the types of crimes for which they were incarcerated or on contact with health care services within the past year.
Conclusion:
The findings indicate the need for a link between the jail and community services for homeless individuals.

N2  - The present study sought to determine whether gender-specific differences existed in the perception of drug user treatment services delivered at a residential substance misuse treatment program operated by a large youth correctional agency in the western United States. Hypothesized gender differences in perceptions of treatment services and treatment-related needs were confirmed in a number of areas such as treatment engagement, counseling needs, and post-release concerns. Findings of this exploratory study underscore the need to consider gender-specific issues in correctional substance misuse treatment for young offenders.

N2  - In this chapter, we draw from our empirical research on the introduction of forensic DNA databases in Brazil to give an account on subjects that help us understand the history and practices surrounding this technology in the country. First, we address the early dynamics of the introduction of the forensic DNA databases to outline some associations between technology, state, legal actors and commercial interests that were important to shaping the introduction process and the legal framing of this 'traveling technology' when it arrived in Brazil. Second, we address critical responses to the legal framing, focusing on a Supreme Court public hearing on the constitutionality of Brazilian DNA database law. This hearing brings the next subject concerning Brazilian's forensic DNA databases: practical challenges that emerge from the relation with other institutions, infrastructures and the memory of dictatorship's history of torture inside prisons. This part also addresses the expansion of database inclusion criteria to those convicted for a crime doloso (crime committed with intent). The chapter ends bringing forward the role of Brazilian police organizations and infrastructure in making the country's forensic DNA database model. Our intention is to highlight that the Brazilian database focus on mandatory sampling of incarcerated individuals and all its challenges inside Brazilian prisons is not just a choice made by biotechnology companies' lobby and forensic genetics professionals dazzled by the UK and US databases' promises. It is also a recognition by these same stakeholders that the Brazilian police model brings unavoidable difficulties for any police practice that relies on crime scene preservation.
This chapter provides an empirical research on the introduction of forensic DNA databases in Brazil to give an account on subjects that help us understand the history and practices surrounding this technology in the country. Since 2009, after a collaboration agreement with the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigations, Brazil has increased its efforts to expand the use of forensic DNA databases in its technolegal scenery. The 'forensic imaginary' that enacts promising images of using science and technology in police investigations became strategic to the whole Brazilian forensic sciences pledges for more funding, training and protagonism towards forensic experts in formulating public security policies. Since at least 2008, pressure activities have been registered towards Brazilian experts and legislators from the GTH governmental affairs firm, lobby specialists hired by the biotechnology company Thermo Fischer to represent their interests in the expansion of forensic DNA databases around the world.

N2  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a critical problem among the incarcerated population, with rates as high as 17% being reported for prison systems in New York, The literature suggests that stressful living conditions and inherent defects in the immune system associated with HIV infection make prison populations more susceptible to a disproportionate decrease in their CD4 counts. To determine the effects of incarceration on HIV-infected individuals, the charts of 800 inmates were reviewed. Baseline (draw 1), 2- to 5-month (draw 2), and 6- to 12-month (draw 3) CD4 cell counts were obtained. Mean cell counts were calculated, and paired t-tests were used to identify differences. The group receiving antiretrovirals throughout showed no difference in mean CD4 cell count between draws 1 and 2 or between draws 1 and 3. The group not receiving HIV medications did not show a significant difference in CD4 cell counts between draws 1 and 2, but did show a significant difference between draws 1 and 3. For this group, the rate of decline in CD4 cells was greater than among an outpatient setting. The subsample of subjects initiating therapy prior to the second blood draw showed a significant increase in mean CD4 cell counts at draw 1 versus draw 2, but did not show a significant change when comparing draw 1 to draw 3. When examining subjects based on their antiviral status, the mean CD4 cell count at each of the draws was statistically associated with subjects' antiviral status. We conclude that incarceration causes a more rapid decrease in CD4 cells compared with an outpatient population, causing clinical significance on the normal course of HIV disease.

N2  - A continuum of correctional-based therapeutic community (TC) treatment programs for drug-involved offenders has been functioning for several years in Delaware. Previous evaluations have shown the efficacy of the full continuum for up to three years posttreatment, though there has been some question of the benefits of treatment within prison. The particular focus here is on the relative impact of the within-prison, transitional, and aftercare treatment components upon criminal recidivism and relapse to illicit drug use. The relative benefit of participation in each component is supported, over and above the effects of differences in demographics and histories of criminal behavior and illicit substance use. However, the residential transitional program effects are generally larger and more long lasting. Additionally, the two outcomes appear differentially sensitive to the degree of completion of the continuum. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Early American culture was rife with contradictions. The War for Independence upset long-standing social hierarchies among white men while leaving white women, African Americans, and laboring people with little to show for their efforts. Victory ensured that the economic interests of Anglo-American merchants would no longer be thwarted by the political or economic whims of the British, making the war little more than a lateral move. When British aristocrats and elites went packing, wealthy and learned Anglo-American men took their places as heads of state, industry, and society.

N2  - The Stay'n Out therapeutic community was created 25 years ago, the first rigorously evaluated prison program that demonstrated recidivism reduction. Since then, there has been a growing appreciation for the recidivism-reducing benefit of substance abuse treatment and the general understanding has been reached that prison treatment for substance abuse is good for the public interest. A number of replicated outcome studies have led to increases in treatment capacity in most state correctional systems, primarily utilizing the therapeutic community model. In contrast, efforts to introduce treatment for offenders with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders (COD) are only beginning. This article describes developments in prison substance abuse treatment and reentry programs and offers some guiding observations from prison substance abuse treatment history that could facilitate the development of COD treatment. Lessons learned include that: public safety (i.e., recidivism reduction) is a primary goal; personal accountability as a basic treatment value facilitates cooperation between treatment and correctional staff; self-help approaches foster more ambitious treatment goals than just symptom reduction; and well-run treatment programs often ease the burden of correctional administration.

N2  - Severe restrictions on the transfer of mentally disturbed prisoners to psychiatric hospital were introduced in Auckland in 1983, while policy in other parts of New Zealand was unchanged. Among male prisoners, the suicide rate (per 100 000 man-years) increased from 27·3 in 1973-82 to 178·0 in 1983-87—an increase in relative risk, compared with unconfined men, from 1·6 to 8·2. Auckland accounted for most of this increase, from 37/100 000 man-years in 1973-82 to 549/100 000 in 1983-87. This striking increase in prison suicide rate in Auckland underlines the importance of ready access to psychiatric care for prisoners.

N2  - To describe the health effects of the political system in Zaïre on asylum seekers seen at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture a retrospective study was performed of the records of 92 asylum seekers from Zaïre who were seen for medical reports at the medical foundation in 1993 and 1994. Eighty one had been imprisoned; the others had been severely ill treated at home by the security services. Sixty six had been detained for up to one year. Prison conditions were invariably insanitary, and food of poor quality when provided. All had been beaten on arrest, and all but two had been beaten repeatedly in prison. Nearly all the women and some of the men described sexual abuse. Almost all left prison through bribery or because a guard had a similar background. Seventy two asylum seekers had scarring, considered to be consistent with the history, and 70 were considered to have suffered persistent psychological damage. Asylum seekers from Zaïre will have health effects from experiences unimaginable to the ordinary Briton. An understanding of the background will help clinicians manage them.

N2  - Ten cases of meningococcal meningitis in the Los Angeles County men's jail system in 1986 were the first known reported cases in this population. New cases have continued into 1990. Nineteen of 21 symptomatic cases identified by serogroup from the men's jail occurring through 1988 had serogroup C. The prevalence of meningococcal carriage and potential risk factors were studied in 1988 among 150 men booked to enter the jail, 350 inmates being released, and 100 jail staff. The prevalence of meningococcal carriage among releases, bookings, and staff were 25.4%, 18.7%, and 5.0%, respectively. Among releases, imprisonment longer than a threshold of 28 days increased carriage of serogroup C 10.0 times (95% confidence interval (Cl) 4.6–21.6). Among bookings, household crowding increased serogroup C carnage 8.2 times (95% Cl 1.5–45.3). Direct and passive smoking at home increased carriage of any serogroup 5.2 (95% Cl 1.2–47.5) and 2.5 (95% Cl 1.1–5.8) times, respectively. Feasible potential interventions indude banning smoking in the jail and immunization with quadnvalent meningococcal vaccine of booked men sentenced for one month or more.

N2  - The number of incarcerated women is increasing, thus pregnancy in prison is no longer uncommon. We reviewed the perinatal outcome of 53 women with short-term incarceration (fewer than 90 days) and of 53 women who experienced long-term incarceration (more than 120 days). Poor prenatal care, history of drug abuse, hepatitis, and poor nutrition were more common among the short-incarceration group. Of infants born to short-incarceration women, 32 (60%) were normal, four (7%) stillborn, eight (15%) premature, six (11%) small for gestational age, and four (7%) septic. Women in the longincarceration group delivered 48 normal infants (91%), whereas two were offspring of diabetic mothers and three were premature. Birth weight for infants born to smokers in the short-incarceration group was significantly lower than that of infants born to smokers in the long-incarceration group. Women who suffer short incarcerations experience high perinatal mortality and morbidity. In contrast, those incarcerated longer appear to benefit from better prenatal care, improved nutrition, and a structured environment, and thus a more favorable perinatal outcome.

N2  - In 1989, 1990 and 1992, 19%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of all prisoners newly admitted to prisons and penitentiary institutions in Austria underwent HIV antibody tests. Based on the HIV test outcome in prisons in which more than 80% of the newly admitted inmates were tested, annual HIV prevalences among prison inmates in Austria were determined. These were 0.5% (11/2,223), 1.3% (19/1,466) and 0.9% (14/1,509) in 1989, 1990 and 1992, respectively. The prevalence rates among prison inmates in Austria are thus 5 times higher than those in the general Austrian population. About 5% of all inmates belong to the high-risk group of intravenous drug users. Inquiries into HIV risk behavior among prison inmates showed that, in Austrian prisons just like in those of many other countries, intravenous drug use and sexual contacts are common practices. As disposable needles and condoms are not available to prison inmates, these practices carry a particularly high risk of HIV transmission. The data collected can be taken as a basis for developing strategies which are designed to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in prisons and which have a major bearing on the development of the HIV pandemic.

N2  - The author explores the process of how homeless mentally ill persons become involved with the criminal justice system. The unique demands of homelessness and chronic mental illness were specifically examined in this naturalistically based study. The author concludes that a combination of severe mental illness, a tendency to decompensate in a nonstructured environment, and an inability or unwillingness to follow through with aftercare contributed to involvement with the criminal justice system. Changes in the mental health system that would prevent the criminalization of the homeless mentally ill are suggested.

N2  - During the latter half of 1989, HIV prevalence in South Australian prisoners was 1.4%. The prevalence of HIV infection across the prison system did not change significantly during 1989 but there was clustering of HIV-infected prisoners in some prisons. Almost half the prisoners from all of the South Australian prisons agreed to participate in our studies, from which we estimate that about 42% of prisoners engage in risk behaviours at least once while incarcerated. Prisoners estimated that 36% of all prisoners inject drugs intravenously at some stage during their stay and that 12% engage in anal intercourse at least once. Interviews with former prisoners who had a history of intravenous drug use revealed that about half had injected themselves while in prison, 60% shared needles and most did not clean shared needles adequately. Most of these prisoners injected themselves once a month or less frequently. The conditions for spread of HIV within the prison system exist but at the current prevalence of infection, transmission can be expected to be infrequent. The opportunity exists now to improve and expand preventive measures.

N2  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of chlamydial infection in adolescents entering public juvenile facilities in the province of Quebec and the frequency of their risk behaviours for STDs and HIV infection. Adolescents were asked to complete an anonymous self-administered questionnaire and to be screened for Chlamydia trachomatis. Of 731 sexually active adolescents, 62% agreed to be tested. The overall prevalence rate was 7.7% (95% confidence interval: 5.1% -10.3%). The prevalence was significantly higher in female than in male teenagers: 12% vs 3% (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that screening for chlamydial infection should be offered to all sexually active female teenagers admitted into juvenile facilities. For males, selective screening taking into account sexual history would be a more realistic approach. The frequency of high risk activities for STDs and HIV infection points to the importance of specific prevention programs for this population. Cette étude visait à déterminer la prévalence de l'infection à chlamydia chez les jeunes admis dans les centres de réadaptation pour adolescents de la province de Québec et d'évaluer la fréquence des comportements à risque de MTS et d'infection au VIH. Les jeunes ont été invités à répondre à un questionnaire anonyme auto-administré et à être dépistés pour Chlamydia trachomatis. Des 731 jeunes actifs sexuellement, 62 % ont accepté d'être testés. La prévalence de l'infection était de 7,7 % (intervalle de confiance à 95 %: 5,1 % à 10,3 %). Elle était significativement plus élevée chez les adolescentes que chez les adolescents: 12 % vs 3 %, (test exact de Fisher, p<0,001). Ces résultats suggèrent qu'un dépistage de C. trachomatis devrait être offert à toutes les adolescentes sexuellement actives admises en centre de réadaptation. Pour les adolescents, un dépistage ciblé qui tienne compte des comportements à risque serait une approche plus réaliste. La fréquence élevée des comportements à risque justifie le besoin de programmes de prévention spécifiques pour cette population.

N2  - Treatment outcomes of 296 subjects admitted to methadone maintenance while on probation or parole are compared to those of 314 subjects admitted without such compulsory supervision. Equivalent treatment services were offered to both groups. The pretreatment differences between groups were small except for time incarcerated. All subjects were followed for one year. The compulsory supervision group had worse outcomes with respect to retention, productive activity, and incarceration. The differences were small except for incarceration. The mean number of months incarcerated was 2.1 for the compulsory supervision group and 0.7 for the voluntary group. Of subjects discharged from treatment, a higher percentage of the compulsory supervision group was discharged because of incarceration, but a higher percentage of the voluntary group was discharged for noncompliance with program requirements. The findings do not support a policy of exclusion of opioid users from methadone maintenance because they are on probation or parole.

N2  - This paper reports the results of a study on the use of illicit drugs and related problems in groups that are often considered hidden populations at high risk for drug abuse. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in 1992–94 with 5,168 subjects from sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, hospital emergency rooms (ER), and jails in Los Angeles County, California. Extensive drug involvement and other HIV-risk behaviors were reported by all three samples. Excluding marijuana, crack and cocaine were the most prevalent drugs used; the rate of positive cocaine urinalysis was 8.5% for STD subjects, 18.1% for ER subjects, and 52.8% for the arrestees. About 40% of the subjects from both STDs and jails and 27% from ERs reported three or more sex partners in the past year. About 41% of STD and 49% of ER samples also reported having arrest records. Current use of heroin and cocaine was highly associated with multiple sex partners and an arrest record. The study confirmed the high prevalence of drug abuse and other high-risk behaviors in these samples. The importance of targeting these groups for early identification and intervention is underscored.

N2  - Five hundred three injecting drug users in Glasgow recruited by a multisite and citywide sampling strategy were questioned regarding their drug-taking behaviour during episodes of custody over the six months prior to interview. Fifty-two percent had been in custody during the past 6 months, 16% of these had injected while in custody. Of these 73% borrowed injecting equipment and 78% handed on used equipment to others. All those who shared, cleaned their injecting sets before use. Over half of those who injected had a source of new sets. While the potential exists for spread of HIV among drug users while in custody there is clear understanding among them of the route by which the virus is spread and also the will to prevent it.

N2  - Drug abuse is the primary reason women enter prison and is the primary health problem of women in prison. There has been little research conducted specifically with this population; information must be drawn from studies with nonincarcerated addicted women and incarcerated addicted men. The purpose of this paper is to review what is known about the treatment and aftercare needs of this group (including relapse and recidivism prevention) and to propose an agenda for future research.

N2  - A survey of the 15,379 cases of tuberculosis reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 29 State health departments in 1984 and 1985 revealed that 7.7 percent of the victims older than age 64 were living in a nursing home at the time of diagnosis and 1.8 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 were living in a correctional institution at the time of diagnosis. Incidence rates of tuberculosis for residents of nursing homes and for inmates of Federal and State prisons and local jails were estimated using denominators derived from institutional population counts provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and by the Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, and Bureau of Prisons. The aggregate tuberculosis incidence rate for nursing home residents in the 29 States was 1.8 times higher than the rate seen in elderly persons who were living in the community (95 percent confidence interval on the relative risk 1.64, 2.02). The aggregate tuberculosis incidence rate for inmates in correctional facilities was 3.9 times higher than the rate for persons of a similar age who were not incarcerated (95 percent confidence interval on the relative risk 3.35,4.49). Strengths and limitations of the design and implications of the first survey of tuberculosis incidence, in a large number of States, among residents of nursing homes and correctional facilities are discussed.

N2  - ABSTRACT
There have been persistent claims that the contingent negative variation (CNV) is absent or greatly attenuated in psychopaths. However, these claims are based on a few studies with serious methodological and diagnostic problems. The present study attempted to avoid these problems. The subjects were male prison inmates divided into psychopaths and nonpsychopaths on the basis of scores on the Psychopathy Checklist. CNV was recorded while the subject performed a forewarned reaction time task with a relatively long interval (6 s) between the warning stimulus and the imperative stimulus. Motivation to perform well was ensured by having reaction times to the imperative stimulus determine how much money would be won or lost on a given trial. The early CNV of psychopaths was significantly larger than was that of the nonpsychopaths. There were no group differences in the late CNV or in reaction time. To the extent that the early CNV reflects processing of the warning stimulus and attention to task demands, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that psychopaths are proficient at focusing attention on events that interest them.

N2  - Females incarcerated for drug-related offenses represent one of the fastest growing populations within jails and prisons. The few studies of female offenders with substance abuse disorders depict a population with multiple psychosocial problems and treatment needs, and one that is characterized by frequent exposure to sexual abuse and other violence. The current study examined intake assessment results from a sample of 1,655 substance-involved jail inmates referred to a jail treatment program in Tampa, Florida, including 26% female and 74% male inmates. The study was designed to identify gender differences in psychosocial characteristics and substance abuse treatment needs among jail inmates. Results indicate that female inmates more frequently experienced employment problems, had lower incomes, more frequently reported cocaine as the primary drug of choice, and were more likely to report depression, anxiety, suicidal behavior, and a history of physical and sexual abuse. Implications for developing specialized treatment approaches for female offenders are discussed, including use of integrated treatment strategies.

N2  - There are long-standing viewpoints that impulsive and violent behavior may stem from brain dysfunction or damage secondary to head injury, disease, or toxic chemical substances. This research has aimed to examine the relationship between potentially toxic metals and aberrant behavior, especially violent activity, through the nonintrusive technique of hair analysis for trace elements. In an initial study, phase I, it was not possible to replicate findings of others who reported high levels of lead, cadmium, and copper in violent offenders. However, high levels of manganese were found in prison versus control groups. In phase II, the possibility of artifactual results arising from prison cooking utensils was controlled for by sampling early after incarceration. Phase III was included to substantiate the initial post hoc findings in an additional jail population. In both latter phases, significantly elevated manganese levels were found in the hair of violent versus nonviolent subjects (
P < .0001). A review of the effects of manganese at deficient and toxic levels does not provide a simple answer as to why manganese levels are elevated in the hair of individuals who have been incarcerated for violent behavior. Our study does not implicate the prison environment or soaps and shampoos used in California prisons. Other factors, such as alcohol, dietary, or psychosocial factors, might influence manganese levels in hair, or any of these factors might function in combination with mild manganese toxicity to contribute to aberrant behavior.

Start Tweeting.” While the Wall Street Journal headline is meant to grab attention, the 2013 story reports on an emerging phenomenon deserving of more sociological attention: lenders scanning social media to determine risk.¹ As suggested by the headline, the tracking of social media may be fortuitous for applicants considered credit unworthy according to traditional scoring methods. This chapter examines this shift in lending and risk assessment, focusing on marketplace lenders, which are “typically online financial platforms that leverage technology to reach potential borrowers, evaluate creditworthiness, and facilitate loans.”² Designing new methods and technology to augment or forgo traditional

N2  - Purpose: To study HIV-associated risk behaviours among young offenders. Methods: Juveniles aged 12 to 19 years entering correctional facilities in British Columbia volunteered in an unlinked anonymous study. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with high-risk sexual behaviours and injection drug use (IDU). Results: Despite low HIV prevalence (0.25%), patterns of risk behaviour were evident. IDU and homosexual/bisexual activity were equally prevalent among youth aged 12 to 15 and 16 to 19 years. For both age groups, IDU and female gender were significant predictors of sex for trade and sex with another drug user. Natives aged 12 to 15 years were five times more likely to inject drugs than non-Natives. However, predictors of IDU differed for older vs. younger youth. Conclusions: Patterns of high-risk activity begin early and selective pressures may differ for younger vs. older young offenders. Youth in detention provide a window of opportunity for enhanced HIV/AIDS education. But: Étudier la prévalence de l'infection au VIH et les comportements à haut risque chez les jeunes admis dans des centres de détention. Méthodologie: Les jeunes âgés de 12 à 19 ans admis dans six centres de détention en Colombie Britannique ont accepté de participer à une étude anonyme, non reliée. Nous avons utilisé un modèle de régression logistique afin d'identifier les facteurs associés aux comportements sexuels à haut risque et à l'usage de drogues injectables. Résultats: Malgré une faible prévalence de l'infection au VIH (0,25 %), la présence de comportements à haut risque était évidente. L'usage de drogue injectable et les activités sexuelles entre hommes étaient aussi prévalents chez les jeunes de 12 à 15 ans que chez ceux de 16 à 19 ans. Chez les deux groupes d'âge, l'usage de drogue injectable et le sexe féminin sont apparus comme des prédicteurs significatifs des activités sexuelles pour de l'argent et du fait d'avoir des relations sexuelles avec un autre usager de drogue injectable. Le risque d'injection de drogue chez les jeunes autochtones âgés de 12 à 15 ans était cinq fois plus important que chez les non-autochtones. Cependant, les facteurs associés à l'usage de drogue injectable étaient différents chez les plus âgés comparativement aux plus jeunes. Conclusions: Les comportements à haut risque se manifestent tôt dans la vie et des forces différentes semblent s'exercer selon l'âge. Les jeunes en détention représentent un groupe privilégié pour des interventions intensives d'éducation sur le VIH/sida.

N2  - A pilot programme of hepatitis B vaccination was set up in three prisons to assess the feasibility and results of this method of reaching a high-risk population. Hepatitis B vaccine was offered to all inmates who lacked serological markers for hepatitis B virus. The antibody response was assessed in those who received two or three doses of vaccine. Candidates for vaccination were 41% of 1755 imprisoned men (20% of intravenous drug users (IVDU) and 63% of non-IVDU), but complete vaccination could be given to only 33% of candidates. A further 29% received two doses. Seroconversion to anti-HBs (titres > 10 IUl
−1) occurred in 33% of vaccinees after two doses and in 76% after three doses. The overall rate of susceptible inmates who became protected for hepatitis B was 34%. The seroconversion rate was higher when the interval between the first two doses was shorter than 3 weeks (91%), than in cases with an interval of 3–6 weeks (79%) or longer than 6 weeks (33%). Age greater than 35 years and history of IVDU were associated with a lower response to the vaccine, while anti-HIV seropositivity did not influence the response. In conclusion, vaccination of prisoners susceptible to HBV may achieve protection in at least a third of cases. Shortening intervals between the priming doses of vaccine may improve compliance and increases the response.

N2  - This chapter concludes the book with a discussion focused on one other site in which feminist platform politics is played out: within the workplaces of platform companies. The discussion sheds light on the permeation of #MeToo throughout Silicon Valley and beyond, how technology companies are responding to and attempting to address cultures of masculinity within their workspaces (including internal communication platforms), and how this influences the values that are embedded within the design of platform technology. Finally, the chapter includes a reflection on the limitations and scope of the book and points to a need to interrogate other platform ecologies such as the Chinese digital sphere, which is also in the midst of a highly fraught negotiation of feminist values.

N2  - The MMPI and Jesness Inventory were used to construct groupings of juvenile delinquents homogeneous with respect to personality characteristics. Subjects were 191 incarcerated juvenile delinquents, aged 12 to 19. All participants had been adjudicated on one or more serious offenses. Five subtypes of delinquents were identified. They included an alienated, unsocialized group, an insecure‐anxious group, a group reporting limited difficulties with peers hut alienated from adults, a group with no apparent emotional disturbance, and a group with multiple elevations. Significant differences between clusters with regard to self‐reported explosiveness. suicidality, gang activities, substance abuse. history of sexual abuse, and delusions and hallucinations were identified. Discriminant function analysis was then used to support the generalizability of the classification system to an independent sample. Eighty per cent of the second sample were accurately classified. The subtypes identified are compared to delinquent classification systems developed previously.

N2  - Four hundred and eighty male prisoners and 500 male staff from 7 Scottish prisons took part in a study assessing perception of risk and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS. Prison staff were found to perceive prison as a higher-risk environment for HIV/AIDS than outside prison, whereas prisoners perceived the opposite. Prisoners perceived less personal risk of HIV/AIDS inside prison than staff. Staff and prisoner concern towards HIV/AIDS was greater than perceived risk of HIV/AIDS, and concern was found to be associated with a number of demographic variables, whereas perceived risk was less influenced by such variables. These findings suggest that the process of risk perception may operate on more than one level. Factor analysis of attitudes towards HIV/AIDS produced four factors for both staff and prisoners: 'Interacting with people with HIV/AIDS'; 'Social control of HIV/ AIDS'; 'HIV/AIDS prevention for high-risk groups'; and 'Response to HIV/AIDS high-risk behaviour'. For both staff and prisoners, greater concern and perceived risk towards HIV/AIDS was associated with a lower tolerance for interacting with people with HIV/AIDS and more support for strict social control measures against people with HIV/AIDS.

N2  - The HCR-20 and the PCL:SV were used in a prospective study of 41 long-term sentenced offenders in two correctional, maximum-security institutions. The aim was to test the validity of these instruments in the prediction of institutional violence. All assessments were made by a comprehensive examination of the offenders' files, completed with clinical interviews ranging from 1 to 3 hours. The mean follow-up time was 8 months. Our results show high predictive validity for the HCR-20's clinical and risk management items, but for almost none of its historical items. The results suggest that violence inside correctional institutions can be predicted with a certain degree of validity by using the HCR-20 and the PCL:SV, even within a selective 'high-risk' group of offenders such as that under study here.

N2  - This chapter details how the States of Incarceration project invited teams of students, people directly impacted by incarceration, and historical and legal experts in 20 cities to explore the roots of mass incarceration in each of their localities. Students in New Orleans and North Carolina traced a historical trajectory from slavery to convict leasing to mass incarceration through an exploration of how incarcerated laborers worked their land and built their roads. To understand high rates of incarceration among Native Americans in their state, the University of Minnesota team started with the Dakota Wars and the ideologies and technologies of settler colonialism. Four of the local teams - in New Jersey, Arizona, Florida, and Texas - chose to focus on immigrant detention. While the teams together formulated collective questions, their diverse answers emerged organically from their local contexts, creating much richer and more complex genealogies of incarceration than any central scholarly committee could have developed. In an age of one-size-fits-all approaches to criminal justice reform, these diverse local histories suggested new locally responsive policy solutions. This chapter traces the impact of the exhibit in different localities, including its influence on institutional practices and local criminal justice.

N2  - Psychiatric disturbance, and its relationship to delinquent behavior, was investigated in 71 incarcerated seriously delinquent adolescents (40 male, 31 female) using structured diagnostic instruments (SADA-DSM-III) and a definition of delinquency based on adjudicated felonies. A wide range of psychopathology was identified, with all subjects receiving multiple psychiatric diagnoses. Substance abuse/alcoholism, borderline personality disorder, and major/minor affective disorders were the most common diagnoses. Measures associated with severity of delinquency and adult antisocial outcome were most clearly associated with borderline personality disorder and substance/alcohol abuse. Results are discussed with regard to future studies and treatment implications.

N2  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of positive tuberculin skin test (TST) reactions (10 mm or greater) among noil-time employees of a provincial prison for women in Montreal. Methods: Participants underwent tuberculin skin testing and completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Among 129 employees identified, 118 (91%) underwent tuberculin testing. Among 102 born in Quebec who completed the questionnaire, 33 (32%) had positive TST reactions, including 12 (23%) of 52 subjects who had never been vaccinated. Positive TST reactions were significantly associated in multivariate analysis with BCG vaccination after infancy (OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.5-13.5), years of work at other provincial prisons (OR = 2.5 for each 5 years of work, 95% CI = 1.2-5.2), travel to tuberculosis endemic countries (OR = 7.7, 95% CI = 1.4-43), although not with work in the prison for women (OR = 1.3,95% CI = 0.9-1.9) Conclusion: The prevalence of positive TST reactions was greater among workers at a provincial prison for women than among a sample of students, suggesting increased occupational risk of tuberculosis infection. Objectif: Déterminer la prévalence des cuti-réactions positives à la tuberculine (10 mm ou plus) parmi les employés à temps plein d'une prison provinciale pour les femmes à Montréal. Méthodologie : Les participants ont passé un test cutané à la tuberculine et ont répondu euxmêmes à un questionnaire. Résultats : Sur 129 employés identifiés, 118 (91 %) ont subi un test cutané à la tuberculine. Sur les 102 d'entre eux nés au Québec qui ont rempli le questionnaire, 33 (32 %) ont eu une cuti-réaction positive, dont 12 parmi les 52 individus qui n'avaient jamais été vaccinés. Dans l'analyse multivariable, les cuti-réactions positives sont apparues nettement associées à la vaccination au BCG après l'enfance (risque relatif [RR] = 4.5, 95 % intervalle de confiance [IC] = 1.5-13.5), à des années de travail dans d'autres prisons provinciales (RR = 2.5 pour 5 années de travail, 95 % IC = 1.2-5.2), à des voyages dans des pays où la tuberculose est endémique (RR = 7.7, 95 % IC = 1.4-43), mais pas avec le travail dans la prison pour femmes (RR = 1.3,95 % IC = 0.9-1.9). Conclusions : La prévalence des cuti-réactions positives est plus importante parmi les employés d'une prison provinciale pour femmes que parmi un échantillon d'étudiants, ce qui tend à indiquer une augmentation du risque professionnel de contraction de la tuberculose.

Twelve of the 37 patients were impaired. Violence ratings were made on inpatient behavior and adult criminal records. Impairment status was related to adult history of violence but not inpatient violence. The most violent patients (by criminal record) were from the impaired category.

N2  - We examined attitudinal and demographic col-relates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the Patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems.

N2  - Objective: The aim of the paper is to describe some of the psychiatric, social and criminological features of female prisoners in Tasmania between 1981 and 1990 inclusive.
Method: Data were collated from prison records for all 210 women prisoners incarcerated between the above dates. Using the Mental Health Services database it was determined which prisoners had prior contact with State Psychiatric Services, their clinical state, various demographic data and ICD-9 diagnoses. Forensic data obtained from prison records were compared for those with and those without a psychiatric history of attendance at Mental Health Services; appropriate privacy safeguards were used in handling the material.
Results: Thirty-five per cent of prisoners had prior contact with the Mental Health Services before imprisonment. They were predominantly persons with an abnormal personality. Non-addictive drug abuse was the next most common psychiatric category (19%). Only 3% suffered from schizophrenia or affective disorder. Those with prior psychiatric presentation had greater social maladjustment, longer sentences for similar offences and a higher recidivism rate. There was an increase in the number of prisoners with and without a psychiatric diagnosis during the decade.
Conclusions: Thirty-five per cent of the female prison population had previously attended psychiatric services in the State. This is fewer than reported in Britain and the US, probably because of the different social structure of this community. These persons differ from other prisoners by showing greater impairment in social adjustments and relationships. They appear to be treated differently with respect to sentencing. There was no evidence of a simple reciprocal relationship between deinstitutionalisation and imprisonment.

N2  - Inner-city male adolescents in jail in New York City (N = 427) were interviewed to examine correlates of cocaine or crack use. Twenty-three percent had used cocaine or crack in the month before arrest and 32% reported lifetime use. Substantial rates of robbery, murder, other violent crime, weapons possession, and drug dealing were found. However, type of crime, including violent crime, was not related either to cocaine/crack use or to drug dealing. Current cocaine/crack users were more likely to use alcohol, marijuana, and intranasal heroin; to have multiple previous arrests; to be out of school; to be psychologically distressed; to have been sexually molested as a child; to have substance abusing parents; and to have cocaine/crack-using friends. They were also more likely to have frequent sex with girls, to be gay or bisexual, and to engage in anal intercourse. The findings should be considered in developing more effective drug abuse prevention and treatment interventions, and HIV prevention education, for incarcerated at-risk adolescents.

N2  - Objectives:
1) To determine if incarcerated youth and conduct-disordered youth in treatment display similar risk factors associated with chronicity of antisocial behaviour; 2) to determine if incarcerated youth had experienced high numbers of interventions by many different agencies as has been reported for conduct-disordered youth in treatment.
Method:
The files of 25 conduct-disordered youth in treatment and 25 incarcerated youth were examined to extract all relevant data.
Results:
Incarcerated youth were similar to conduct-disordered youth with regard to the number of symptoms of disruptive behaviour disorders, age of onset of behavioural problems, and family backgrounds. Both groups had high numbers of interventions and agencies in their histories. Interventions began earlier for the conduct-disordered youth.
Conclusion:
The distinction between conduct-disordered youth who are treated and youth who are incarcerated may be arbitrary and accidental. Given the similarity in the clinical characteristics, incarcerated youth should be offered help that is similar to that offered to conduct-disordered youth. Such help may lower the rate of recidivism.

N2  - Prison suicide rates in France from 1852 to 1913 were strongly correlated with the overall male suicide rate in France. Measures of domestic social integration were associated with both of these suicide rates. but were less successful in accounting for the prison suicide rate than the overall male suicide rate.

N2  - Prisons contain individuals at high risk of HIV infection, notably through intravenous drug use. For complex political, social and legal reasons penal institutions in the UK are unable to provide condoms and clean needles. The outbreak of HIV and hepatitis B that occurred in a Scottish prison in 1993 focused attention on the potential problems. Debate about the issue is hampered by a lack of useful information. Current data about risk behaviour and seroprevalence is reviewed, and compared with experience in other countries. Injecting drug use in prison appears to be common, and the majority who inject in prison share equipment, which can be used many times. Sexual activity may be a smaller risk factor, but does occur between men in prison. In addition, prisoners appear to have high rates of partner change between sentences. The true prevalence of HIV in UK prisons is difficult to assess, but the available data suggest it is between 0.1 and 4.5%, lower than in Southern Europe and the USA. A window of opportunity still exists to prevent further outbreaks of HIV in UK penal institutions and to maintain these low prevalence rates. Strenuous, and possibly unpalatable measures are needed now.

N2  - A cross-sectional study was carried out among 1284 male and 54 female prisoners to assess the prevalence of and risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in 4 correctional institutions of Maputo, Mozambique. Among the men, 32% reported a history of prostitute contact and 41% reported a history of STD. Only 9% reported having ever used condoms. Seventy (5.5%) men reported having had sexual intercourse while in prison, in all but one instance this involved sex with another man. There was no reported intravenous drug use. One hundred and four (7.8%) inmates had positive serological tests for syphilis and 8 (0.6%) had antibodies to HIV. Among men, syphilis was associated with a history of genital ulcer [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4, 6.4] and uncircumcised status (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0, 2.5). This study demonstrates that syphilis is common among inmates in Maputo and that risk behaviours for STD transmission exist within Maputo prisons. There is a need for STD screening and treatment programmes within prisons in Mozambique and the introduction of educational interventions, including condom promotion.

N2  - The complexity of architecture, engineering and building technologies has increased exponentially in recent decades, distorting how buildings are designed, constructed and even conceived. The challenge with innovation is that the world is rarely ready for it. 'Innovation' is a relatively new concept. Applying Design to Value to architecture, however, is not simply a direct translation from the manufacturing sector, given that the scale of a building's footprint is significantly larger than that of, say, a car or a bottle of shampoo. Bryden Wood has been working with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) since 2011, and were first asked to help them develop more digitally driven and efficient briefing and design processes. As a result, Bryden Wood identified two key lenses through which the team would repeatedly judge iterative design solutions: effectiveness and efficiency. A Design to Value approach tapped into the MoJ's desire to innovate their prison system.

N2  - Many states practise or condone torture to control dissident groups in their population. Most techniques used and the resulting injuries are common to all cultures. 31 male Sikh asylum-seekers, examined between December, 1991, and May, 1994, showed a pattern of abuse that included features particular to their region of origin. All gave a persuasive history of serious abuse and all showed long-term mental and physical effects that could be convincingly attributed to their experiences.

N2  - We studied 977 newly incarcerated Oregon inmates to compare voluntary versus mandatory human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIVAb) testing in the prison setting. All inmates were offered HIVAb counseling and testing. Blood drawn for routine syphilis serology from those who declined this offer was also tested for HIVAb after personal identifiers had been removed. Only 1.2 percent (12) prisoners were HIV positive. However, 62.5 percent (611) inmates were at risk for HIV infection by being an intravenous drug user, a male homosexual, or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) positive. The ratio of at-risk, as yet uninfected inmates to those already HIV infected was 53 to 1. Two-thirds of all inmates including those at-risk chose to receive counseling and testing. In areas where most at-risk inmates are not yet infected, it may be more appropriate for HIV prevention activities in prison to focus on voluntary programs that emphasize education and counseling rather than mandatory programs that emphasize testing.

N2  - OBJECTIVE--To describe the physical, psychological, and family consequences of the detention of British subjects as hostages in Kuwait or Iraq, or both, after the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 and to investigate the relation between types of trauma experienced and these reactions. DESIGN--Postal questionnaire. SUBJECTS--381 respondents. RESULTS--Many health, social, and psychological sequelae were identified. Problems with present finance, accommodation, and work are important causes of distress. Many hostages coped well and gained self esteem. CONCLUSIONS--A minority of respondents require further support and treatment. Expatriates in risk areas should retain assets in their home country.

N2  - Effective postincarceration treatment for individuals with preincarceration heroin dependence is urgently needed because relapse typically follows release. This article presents first-year findings from a unique 2-year pilot study of opioid agonist maintenance treatment initiated in prison and continued in the community. Incarcerated males with preincarceration heroin dependence were randomly assigned to Levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM) maintenance or control conditions 3 months before release. Approximately 92% of eligible inmates volunteered to participate; 36 of 58 subjects who were eligible and randomly assigned to LAAM maintenance successfully initiated treatment. Twenty-eight of these continued on LAAM until release; 22 (78.6%) entered community-based maintenance treatment; and 11 (50%) remained in treatment at least 6 months postrelease. Changes in LAAM's labeling because of its association with cardiac arrhythmias now makes it a second-line treatment for heroin dependence, unsuitable for treatment initiation. Nonetheless, study findings may also be applicable to methadone maintenance treatment, suggesting such treatment may be a promising means of engaging prisoners with preincarceration heroin dependence into continuing treatment.

N2  - Correctional administrators are equipped with a variety of responses to manage problematic inmate behavior. The forms of these responses range from subtle coercion in the context of everyday prison life to segregative placements that include protective custody, disciplinary confinement, and mental health residential services. Using logistic regression, the present study examines the disproportionate placement of female inmates in mental health facilities. The results suggest that placement differences for male and for female inmates reflect both psychiatric need and differential responses to role-incongruent behavior.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Aims  To review evidence on the effectiveness of opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) in prison and post‐release.
Methods  Systematic review of experimental and observational studies of prisoners receiving OMT regarding treatment retention, opioid use, risk behaviours, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) incidence, criminality, re‐incarceration and mortality. We searched electronic research databases, specialist journals and the EMCDDA library for relevant studies until January 2011. Review conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
Results  Twenty‐one studies were identified: six experimental and 15 observational. OMT was associated significantly with reduced heroin use, injecting and syringe‐sharing in prison if doses were adequate. Pre‐release OMT was associated significantly with increased treatment entry and retention after release if arrangements existed to continue treatment. For other outcomes, associations with pre‐release OMT were weaker. Four of five studies found post‐release reductions in heroin use. Evidence regarding crime and re‐incarceration was equivocal. There was insufficient evidence concerning HIV/HCV incidence. There was limited evidence that pre‐release OMT reduces post‐release mortality. Disruption of OMT continuity, especially due to brief periods of imprisonment, was associated with very significant increases in HCV incidence.
Conclusions  Benefits of prison OMT are similar to those in community settings. OMT presents an opportunity to recruit problem opioid users into treatment, to reduce illicit opioid use and risk behaviours in prison and potentially minimize overdose risks on release. If liaison with community‐based programmes exists, prison OMT facilitates continuity of treatment and longer‐term benefits can be achieved. For prisoners in OMT before imprisonment, prison OMT provides treatment continuity.

N2  - A competitive survey was carried out in three medium-security Federal prisons in British Columbia, Canada. The purpose was to compare the social, emotional, and physical health characteristics of older and younger inmates. The results showed that when compared with younger inmates, the older men had more contacts with friends and family, more friends in prison, and experienced less stress than the younger men. Aside from problems with vision and hearing, their physical health did not appear to be any worse when compared to that of younger inmates. This was surprising in light of age-related declines in health found in both the general population and in previous research with inmates. The study uncovered several unique problems concerning older prisoners, and a number of policy and program recommendations were generated.

N2  - A sample of men in prison was interviewed and rated for the presence of six behaviours commonly thought to be impulsive: alcohol abuse (CAGE positive), sedative dependence, other drug abuse, pathological gambling, repeated aggression and self‐harm. They were also asked to complete the EPQ and 15 questionnaires. Out of 61 men on a special protection, wing, 51 agreed to take part. We found that the score on the Impulsiveness scale of the 15 correlated with the number of disorders present in individuals, even when corrected for age. Pathological gambling and self‐harm did not correlate with the presence of any of the other behaviours.

N2  - This note considers the spread of HIV in a single prison where there is a constant rate of departure and replacement of prisoners. Some of the incoming prisoners will be HIV+, and homogeneous mixing within the prison is assumed. HIV is thus spread sexually or by the sharing of intravenous drug users' needles. A deterministic continuous time prison model is examined, and the number of HIV+ infective prisoners at time t derived. A stochastic analogue of this model is constructed, in the form of a continuous Markov chain, and its embedded chain studied. Finally, a control procedure involving the screening of a proportion of the incoming prisoners, and the quarantining of the HIV+ individuals is proposed. Its consequences are derived for the deterministic model. The proportion to be screened, given a total expenditure for the screening procedure and the medical costs of quarantined and non‐quarantined infectives, can be calculated.

N2  - In 1990, Kansas's Mental Health Reform legislation began transferring fiscal support for the delivery of mental health services away from state institutions and into the local community, culminating in the closure of one state hospital facility in 1997. Kansas jails were studied to determine the resulting impact of that hospital closure on the State's jail systems, including whether an increase in incarceration rates of persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses followed the closure of the hospital. Though a relationship between the hospital closure and incarceration rates cannot be substantiated, the results do provide a rare birds-eye view of the extent of and problems associated with the incarceration of persons with mental illness in a predominantly rural state.

N2  - Symbolic healing is a complex phenomenon that is still relatively poorly understood. This paper documents a process of symbolic healing which is occurring in Canadian penitentiaries, and which involves Aboriginal offenders in cultural awareness and educational programs. The situation is compounded, however, by the existence of offenders from diverse Aboriginal cultural backgrounds with differing degrees of orientation to Aboriginal and Euro-Canadian cultures. Participants must first receive the necessary education to allow them to identify with the healing symbols so that healing may ensue, and both the healers and the patients must engage in a process of redefining their cultures in search of a common cultural base.

N2  - HIV-1 antibody was detected in 6.0 percent of prisoners in an Ethiopian prison. HIV-1 seropositivity was strongly associated with positive VDRL status (RR = 3.7) and recent admission to prison (RR = 3.5). Seropositive prisoners were more likely to have prostitute contacts. No correlation was found between seropositivity and number of sexual contacts, long-term sex partners, or dental extractions. HIV-1 infection in this area may be of recent origin and the high prevalence may reflect rates in the surrounding community.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In November 1986, a Detroit, Michigan city ordinance requiring mandatory jail sentences for illegally carrying a firearm in public was passed to preserve "the public peace, health, safety, and welfare of the people." METHODS: We conducted a set of interrupted time-series analyses to evaluate the impact of the law on the incidence of homicides, hypothesizing that the ordinance, by its nature, would affect only firearm homicides and homicides committed outside (e.g., on the street). RESULTS: The incidence of homicide in general increased after the law was passed, but the increases in non-firearm homicides and homicides committed inside (e.g., in a home) were either statistically significant or approached statistical significance (p = .006 and p = .070, respectively), whereas changes in the incidence of firearm homicides and homicides committed outside were not statistically significant (p = .238 and p = .418, respectively). We also determined that the ordinance was essentially unenforced, apparently because of a critical shortage of jail space. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with a model in which the ordinance had a dampening effect on firearm homicides occurring in public in Detroit. The apparent preventive effect evident in the time series analyses may have been due to publicity about the ordinance, whereas the small nature of the effect may have been due to the lack of enforcement.

N2  - A retrospective casenote review was performed on all patients over 65 years of age in one health district who were detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 during the first 6 years of its operation. There were 132 episodes of detention affecting 120 patients. Fifty‐three percent were for organic illness and 47% for functional illness. The organically ill were detained most commonly because the carer was no longer able to cope or, for those living alone, because of self‐neglect. The functionally ill were most commonly detained in the interests of their health only. The majority (52/64) of patients with dementia were not discharged to their previous address after being detained, most of these (29/64) being discharged to residential care. Twenty‐seven percent of the whole sample died within a year of being detained, a rate higher than that in the general population. Only nine tribunals were held in the study period.

N2  - Past research has demonstrated that the characteristics of substance abusers vary considerably. Often, however, addicts are considered members of a single, homogeneous group. These erroneous designations may indeed prevent the successful rehabilitation of substance abusers. In the present study, hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses are used to identify a typology of substance users from a sample of 1,580 St. Louis arrestees surveyed through the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program. Five clusters are yielded in the present analysis. The analyses illustrate not only that drug-using classifications differ between criminal and non-criminal populations, but that arrestee populations themselves vary interjurisdictionally. Given these findings, implications for local and regional drug treatment programs are assessed.

N2  - Assessing and responding to suicidal risk among inmates is discussed based on a comprehensive literature review and personal experience. Sections detailing jail conditions, suicide risk factors, reasons for self-harm, and practical responses are included. Intoxication, isolation, and the initial 24 hours of incarceration stand out as significant risk factors within the jail. Determination of risk and considerations in decision-making are emphasized from a practical standpoint, while the inmate's safety and mental health, as well as accountability, are deemed priorities.

N2  - A sample of 144 inmates from a maximum security penitentiary responded to a request for information regarding their average daily intake of nicotine and caffeine. They also rated the quality of their appetite and sleep, their level of concentration, their mood and specific feelings of anger, anxiety, frustration, and irritability. Factor analysis generated a two-factor solution of these variables, namely general mood state (mood, anxiety, anger, frustration, and irritability) and a somatic state (appetite, concentration, and sleep). Analysis of variance showed an interaction between level of smoking (nonsmokers, low and high cigarette smokers) and caffeine use (moderate vs. high) on the general mood factor. Nonsmokers who consumed high levels of caffeine experienced poorer general mood than any other group. There was a main effect of cigarette smoking status on the somatic factor, such that greater dissatisfaction was associated with greater consumption. Caffeine consumption was generally high, averaging 800 mg of caffeine per day, per inmate, well above the amount considered to be potentially damaging to health.

N2  - Anergy may occur in groups at high risk for tuberculosis, compromising tuberculin skin testing. Within New York City's correctional system, anergy prevalence was 25% among opiate users referred to detoxification programs and 3% in the general population. Correlates of anergy were recent weight loss and needle sharing. The high prevalence of anergy among opiate users compromises the utility of tuberculosis screening and suggests the need for routine chest x-rays to detect pulmonary tuberculosis in some high-risk-populations.

N2  - This study investigated differences in prevalence and determinants of HIV infection, and in recent risk behaviour (previous 6 months) among injecting drug users (IDUs) who are in contact with different types of services for IDUs in Berlin. Participants (n = 557) were recruited from drug-free long-term treatment centres, a storefront agency and a syringe exchange bus. HIV seroprevalence teas lowest (3.9%) at the treatment centres, and highest among IDUs at the storefront agency (20.7%). In logistic regression, independent risk factors for HIV infection were duration of injecting drug use, borrowing syringes in prison, sex with HIV-positive partners, and prostitution. Syringe sharing in prison was the most important independent determinant of HIV infection among all three subpopulations of IDUs. Participants entering long-term treatment were most likely, and IDUs at the syringe exchange bus were least likely to have borrowed and passed on syringes in the previous 6 months. In logistic regression, site of recruitment was independently associated with recent borrowing of syringes, but not with condom use. Injection of drugs other than heroin only, and injecting in prisons, were also independent predictors of recent borrowing. The results indicate that IDUs entering treatment form an important target group for health education. There is a need for AIDS prevention measures in prisons. The comparatively low levels of recent injection risk behaviour among IDUs at the syringe exchange bus suggest that this type of intervention may be effective in harm reduction.

N2  - Thirty‐eight from a total of 42 known HIV‐positive prisoners in the Irish prison system voluntarily cooperated in a survey of psychological attitudes, knowledge of risk behaviour, intentions with respect to future risk behaviour, and actual past risk behaviour Of this group, 65% reported that they had put others at risk of HIV, since they became aware of their own HIV + status. Only 16% stated that they would definitely not share their drug‐taking equipment in the future and 32% that they would always use a condom in sexual intercourse. In general, psychological and biographical variables were not strongly related to whether or not the respondents had put others at risk of HIV. Nor were there any significant differences in knowledge of at risk behaviour between those who had and those who had not put others at risk. However, there was some evidence for considerable independence between risk‐taking behaviour in the sexual and in the drug‐taking domains, in that risk‐taking in one area was not highly predictive of risk‐taking in the other.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis cervical infection in incarcerated adult women has not been reported. To develop a policy for testing and treatment, we determined the prevalence of and risk factors for chlamydial infection in women in a New York City jail. METHODS. Interviews and cervical cultures for C trachomatis were obtained from 101 consenting female inmates. RESULTS. Positive cultures for C trachomatis were found in 27% of the participants. Mucopurulent cervical discharge and education of 8 years or less were two independent risk factors for infection, but only 63% of the infected women had one or both of these factors. If pelvic tenderness were considered as a third factor, an additional 7% of the infected women would have been identified. CONCLUSIONS. The prevalence of chlamydial infection in this population was as high as that in populations for which presumptive treatment is recommended. Although the optimal policy for detection and treatment of chlamydial infection may vary depending on practical considerations, we suggest that women entering correctional facilities should be screened or offered presumptive therapy for C trachomatis infection.

N2  - Five cases of varicella occurred in a women's prison in Rome. A serosurvey conducted in the prison found that 14.5% of the inmates were susceptible. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of a history of varicella were high, whereas specificity was rather low. The attack rate among susceptible inmates was approximately 22%. Preventive measures probably contributed to reduce infection spread.

N2  - This article describes research conducted to examine the patterns of alcohol and drug use and self concepts of incarcerated adult offenders in relation to age, gender, and ethnicity in a western state. The purpose of this research was to estimate the extent and variety of alcohol and drug use in the prison population and design a data collection instrument. Individual interviews with every newly admitted sentenced felon (N = 157 men and 39 women) were conducted. Inmates reported nearly universal alcohol use and marijuana use and extensive use of cocaine, crack, heroin, crystal methamphetamine (ice) and using various other schedule drugs, usually in combination with alcohol and other drugs. The problem for the interviewers was not how to elicit admissions of drug use but how to categorize the large number of combinations. Polydrug use, often in combination with alcohol, is the rule, not the exception. Starting, switching and quitting, and combining or substituting drugs is reported by the vast majority of inmates. While patterns varied, it was difficult to discern a special class of drug addicts among the inmates. Our findings suggest that large percentages of prison inmates are frequent substance abusers, perceive problems from use, but are often not interested in drug treatment in prison. Many inmates who by their own reports seem appropriate for alcohol or drug treatment do not seek treatment. This is not influenced by the extent of drug use or experience with previous treatment. Female prisoners seem to be more often and more extensively involved in addicting drugs than male prisoners. This is particularly problematic because there are very few specialized treatment or training programs for women offenders. Since drug use is very widespread, urine monitoring is increasing and continued criminalization of all drugs except alcohol enjoys wide support, correctional agencies must search to develop effective and affordable strategies for dealing with drug use.

N2  - The neurophysiologic substrates of violence and aggression have been extensively studied. Although the EEG is often normal in violet persons any abnormalities are generally nonspecific in nature. Evoked potentials have been infrequently used to study such behavior disorders. Long latency auditory event-related potentials (AEPs) were studied in prison inmates incarcerated for unmotivated violet crimes or violence during the commission of other crimes, and in prisoners jailed for non-violent offenses. Habitually violent inmates were compared with an equal number of non-violet prisoners and neurologically and audiologically intact controls. AEPs were recorded to an "oddball" paradigm from vertex and left and right temporal electrodes. None of the prisoners had latencies more than 3 standard deviations beyond the normal group mean. N1 and P2 components were longer in latency and lower in amplitude in prisoners than in controls, but this was not statistically significant. Violent and non-violent individuals did not differ in these measures. P3 was significantly prolonged in latency in violent inmates, but not in those who had committed a violent act. All components were longer in latency on the right in violent prisoners, while amplitudes were lower but not significantly so. This asymmetry was not present in non-violent prisoners or control subjects. Caution is needed in identifying differences between criminals and the general population, and in seeking markers of violent behavior. These findings may indicate cerebral dysfunction in some perpetrators of antisocial behavior, however, and suggest that evidence of non-dominant cerebral hemisphere dysfunction, possibly subtle and chronic, may be found in some habitually violent individuals.

N2  - With little recourse for social and political injustices due to state and federal laws and institutional governance structures that negate youth autonomy as citizens, they are particularly vulnerable to a lack of legislative will for gun violence reform. This chapter focuses on the development of the out-of-school-time project of the National Youth Art Movement Against Gun Violence that launched an art and Augmented Reality interactive tour in the city of Chicago in the fall of 2017. The project provided youth between the ages of 13 and 27 years old with the ability to use their intrinsic talent in the visual arts to develop and lead a public intervention for gun violence enabled with the affordances of mixed reality technologies utilizing public spaces. The result was a nuanced portrayal of the impact of gun violence from their perspective, and a public learning experience that inverted typical power dynamics by placing youth as the teachers and leaders of adults and the traumas of the marginalized into the mainstream.

N2  - Attempts to predict suicide behaviours have produced a number of useful clinical tools. Unfortunately, these have been largely designed with a specific psychiatric population or institutional setting in mind and are not easily transferred to an incarcerated setting. In 1983 the authors developed a suicide checklist which could be used to aid screening of new admissions to Remand Centres in the Province of Alberta. Studies completed to date have revealed this checklist to be a practical and reliable method of standardizing the suicide screening process. This paper presents findings from a study designed to evaluate the predictive power (discriminant validity) of the checklist. A stepwise multivariate framework is used to assess the overall ability of checklist items to discriminate a high risk group. As well, the relative importance of specific socio-demographic, clinical and historical variables is assessed. Data were collected on a cohort of consecutive admissions to the Edmonton Remand Centre during 1986.
Findings reveal that marital status is the only direct statistical predictor of suicide risk. Inmates who had divorced or separated from a spouse were more likely to be active suicide risks at some time during their remand than those who were married or single. Symptom score was found to be generally predictive, however, closer assessment revealed this relationship to be heterogeneous across subgroups defined on the basis of certain criminological variables. The model which allowed for the interaction of clinical with criminological variables correctly discriminated 100% of the active suicide risks and 63 % of inmates who had a prior history of suicide behaviours. The practical implications of these findings for suicide screening are discussed.

N2  - The incidence and prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injection drug users, prostitutes, and other women seeking confidential testing in the Orange County Women's Jail were assessed from 1985 to 1991. A total of 4616 voluntary tests were completed on 3051 women, and 865 women were tested repeatedly. Eighty-two women tested positively, a ratio of 1.8 positives per 100 tests or 2.7% of all persons tested. Cumulative HIV prevalence increased from 2.5% to 2.7% between 1985 and 1991, increased by age, and showed racial differences. Of women with multiple tests, 29 seroconverted. Incidence declined from 5.7 to 1.4 cases per 100 person-years of observation between 1985 and 1991. The overall rate of seroconversion was 1.6 per 100 person-years of observation.

N2  - In Ethiopia, it is generally unknown what proportion of the amoebic infections commonly found, by microscopy, in humans are caused by non-invasive Entamoeba dispar rather than the potentially invasive E. histolytica. Faecal samples were therefore collected from 363 primary-school students and 409 prisoners from various regions of Ethiopia. Each of these samples was checked for Entamoeba infection by the microscopical examination of formol-ether concentrates. DNA was then extracted from the 213 samples (27.6%) found Entamoeba-positive, and run in a real-time PCR with primers, based on the SSU-rRNA gene sequences of E. histolytica and E. dispar, that allow DNA from the two species to be distinguished. Although E. dispar DNA was identified in 195 (91.5%) of the 213 samples checked by PCR, no E. histolytica DNA was detected. This finding is consistent with the conclusion of a previous, smaller investigation: that many amoebic infections in Ethiopia are incorrectly attributed to E. histolytica and then treated, unnecessarily, with amoebicidal drugs.

N2  - The process of achieving a high retention rate of subjects in a 12‐month prospective study of intravenous heroin users in Sydney, Australia is presented. Self‐referred heroin users were compared with heroin users from a court diversion programme. The retention rates throughout the prospective study interview schedules were high, ranging from 69 to 83% of the original sample. No statistical differences were detected between the proportions located at each interview, indicating a high retention rate was maintained despite the passage of time. It is argued that contact with State services, i.e. Methadone Maintenance Programmes and the legal system, particularly the prison service, contributed to this high maintenance. It is speculated that the effectiveness of location strategies reflect prominent characteristics of the populations studied.

N2  - This paper constitutes the first stage of data analysis in a larger controlled study designed to assess the effect of a forensic psychiatric assessment on legal disposition defined in three ways: 1. the number of days spent in custody prior to trial; 2. the number of sentenced days of incarceration; and 3. the conviction rate. A historical cohort design was used to follow two cohorts of individuals remanded, pretrial, to Southern Alberta Provincial Correctional Centres between 1988 and 1989. The study cohort consisted of all offenders detained who received a forensic psychiatric assessment. The comparison cohort consisted of a random sample of persons detained who did not undergo a forensic assessment. Because of small numbers, individuals below the age of 18 and women were excluded from study. This paper compares socio-legal characteristics of study and comparison subjects in order to better understand forensic psychiatric referral patterns and identify potentially confounding factors that would need to be controlled in subsequent analyses of legal outcomes. No differences were noted with respect to educational level but forensic subjects were found to be slightly older (average of 31 years compared to 29 years). Aboriginal peoples (Native Indian, Inuit and Metis) were three times more common among non-forensic offenders. Forensic patients were more likely to have had a prior forensic assessment but less likely to have a prior criminal detention. In addition, forensic patients were three times more likely to be charged with a crime against a person and counted more offenses in the target episode than comparison subjects. The under-representation of Aboriginal peoples in the forensic cohort is discussed in light of the knowledge that mental illnesses are over-represented among native peoples and Aboriginal peoples are over-represented among criminal populations. The next phase of the analysis will compare legal outcomes controlling for differences in age, ethnicity, prior forensic assessments, prior detentions and violent index crimes.

N2  - Although critics have argued that psychiatric medications in correctional settings are often prescribed in a clinically irrational manner, without adequate diagnostic criteria, and for the purposes of coercive control rather than treatment, there has been no systematic research in an attempt to validate these claims. The present study examines the influence of inmate clinical and social characteristics, as well as prison setting factors, on the prescription of psychiatric medication to New York State prison inmates. Study findings show that clinical characteristics predominate in the psychiatric medication prescription process. Specifically, psychiatric impairments, measured in terms of levels of depression, manifest symptomatology, agitation, and prior psychiatric hospitalization were found to be highly significant predictors of drug prescription. This finding suggests clinically appropriate use.Some researchers have suggested that the influence of patient social characteristics on psychiatric treatment is greatest when patient symptomatology is less severe. The conditional effect of inmate social characteristics on drug prescription was examined by levels of inmate impairment, and differences were found. The decision to prescribe medication for mildly impaired inmates appears to be influenced by social factors. However, when an inmateʼs behavior is unquestionably bizarre or disruptive, social status characteristics are less likely to influence physiciansʼ clinical judgments.

N2  - Food restriction is correlated with binge eating, but evidence that restriction leads to binge eating is scanty. In this study we investigated postwar binge eating in 67 World War II combat veterans and 198 former prisoners of war. As predicted, binge eating was relatively rare in combat veterans but was significantly more prevalent in veterans who, as prisoners in German prisoner of war camps, lost significant amounts of weight during their captivity. Our data thus support the contention that starvation or dieting seems to precede binge eating.

Two-thirds of these mothers reported significant periods of time, not due to incarceration, when minor children did not reside with them. Fewer than half of the placements were mandated by child-protective services. Having two or more children while actively alcoholic or residing with a substance abuser correlated strongly with separate residence.

There was both consensus about which group members were rejected and individual differences in the participants' reported desire for future interaction with other group members. Those reporting high levels of depressive negative affect were most likely to be rejected. Those lowest in positive affect indicated the least desire for future interaction with others.

N2  - After four inmates at two New Mexico prisons converted their tuberculosis skin tests, a mass screening program was carried out at all the State's adult correctional facilities (2,240 inmates). Previously unknown converters were found with a disproportionally high per cent of converters (6.8 per cent and 6.3 per cent) and reactors (14.4 per cent and 12.2 per cent) at the first two prisons. No index cases were found. State policy has been revised to include two-stage skin testing of new inmates, annual testing thereafter, and screening of all new correctional staff.

N2  - Research on passive avoidance learning has demonstrated reliable differences between psychopaths and controls when avoidance errors result in electric shock but not in loss of money (
Schmauk, 1970
). Using monetary punishments,
Newman, Widom, and Nathan (1985)
found that psychopathic delinquents performed more poorly than controls in an experimental paradigm employing monetary reward as well as the avoidance contingency. The present study was conducted to replicate and extend these findings using adult psychopaths and a computer controlled task. Sixty white male prisoners were assigned to groups using
Hare's (1980)
Psychopathy Checklist and administered a "go/no-go" discrimination task involving monetary incentives. One condition entailed competing reward and punishment contingencies; the other, two punishment contingencies. As predicted, psychopaths made significantly more passive avoidance errors than nonpsychopaths when the task contained competing goals (
p
< .05) but performed as well as controls when the subjects' only goal was avoiding punishment. Results corroborate earlier findings that psychopaths are relatively poor at learning to inhibit reward-seeking behavior that results in monetary punishment.

N2  - Providing dermatologic care in a prison setting is a challenge to the practitioner's ingenuity and patience because of cumbersome methods of transporting prisoners, poor compliance with prescribed regimens, and follow-up care that is not only inadequate but almost nonexistent. Certain prevalent infections such as tinea pedis and condyloma acuminatum probably are specifically induced by the prison environment. Alopecia areata is unexpectedly common and apparently associated with stress. Pruritus, which is common, is related to both environment and stress. Dermatologic diseases seen commonly in blacks are more prevalent because of the population demographics, yet pseudofolliculitis barbae is unusual as a complaint. In this article we review our experiences in establishing a first in-prison dermatology clinic.

N2  - Auricular acupuncture continues to gain popularity as an adjunct to substance abuse treatment. This report describes an outcomes study in a treatment center tailored to the needs of chronic repeat offenders. Thirty-seven patients who received acupuncture (AC) during the early weeks of treatment were followed for 180 days postadmission. Data were collected for four parameters: (1) program retention, (2) new arrests incurred, (3) drug-positive urinalysis results, and (4) number of days needed to progress from entry level to secondary level treatment. These data were compared to archived information from 49 no-acupuncture (NA) patients who had entered the program before acupuncture became available. Chi-square tests determined that AC patients exhibited significantly higher program retention than NA patients at 30 (
p < 0.0001), 60 (
p < .002), 90 (
p < .001), 120 (
p < .007), and 150 (
p < .031) days. At 180 days, a higher percentage of AC patients than NA patients remained in treatment, but the difference was not significant. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis determined that AC patients had significantly higher cumulative probability of remaining in treatment than did NA patients (
p < .0021). In AC patients, there were decreased numbers of new arrests, drug-positive urinalysis results, and days needed to advance in treatment, but the differences were not significant. Fifty-one percent of all patients named methamphetamine as their primary drug of choice. Regardless of treatment group, methamphetamine-addicted patients exhibited significantly lower program retention than patients addicted to all other drugs (
p < .035). In methamphetamine-addicted patients, acupuncture improved program retention only up to 30 days (
p < .021). These findings support addition of acupuncture to substance abuse treatment for criminal justice clients and indicate a need for acupuncture research focusing on withdrawal from methamphetamine.

N2  - In a study of 452 ex-prisoners in England in 1990, 66 people reported that they were tested for HIV antibodies when last in prison. The circumstances under which many of those who were tested were difficult: 36% found it an unpleasant experience, 17% had not taken the test voluntarily and 55% said they received no counselling.
Further information was gathered about the experiences of those who were HIV positive or assumed to be. Most were accommodated in a 'special location', not allowed to associate with other prisoners and denied access to work or recreational facilities.
These data highlight the difficulties arising from the policy of Viral Infectivity Restrictions, a set of regulations applied to the management of prisoners with HIV in English prisons. This policy created a distressing situation for those tested for HIV or identified as being HIV positive in prison. For the prison environment, these conditions may create a vicious circle reinforcing inaccurate beliefs and anxieties.

N2  - The relationship of The Paulhus Deception Scales (PDS;
Paulhus, 1998) to the Texas Christian University Drug Screen I
(Simpson & Knight, 1998) was investigated in participants screened for a voluntary in-prison substance abuse treatment program. Mean PDS scores for 35 female and 277 male prison inmates were significantly higher than the inmate norms in the test manual. All three PDS scale scores were negatively related to symptom endorsement and to the diagnosis of drug dependence. Almost 37% of participants produced protocols of questionable validity, with 22% faking-good and 14.7% faking-bad. However, over 90% of participants obtained scores that were not covered by the manual's profile typology. These findings underline the importance of deception to correctional assessment and the need for more information on the psychometrics and operating characteristics of the PDS in correctional settings.

N2  - Purpose: This paper presents information on the prevalence of HIV-1 infection among male and female adults and young offenders admitted to Ontario jails, detention and youth centres. Method: Urine specimens, routinely collected on all admissions, were unlinked and screened for the HIV antibody. Information was collected on the inmate's age, gender, history of injection drug use, and the facility in which the sample was collected. The study included 14,284 individuals admitted to 42 remand facilities in Ontario between February and August 1993. Results: Prevalence of HIV infection among inmates was six times higher than in the general population. Inmates with a history of injection drug use were six to 10 times more likely to be HIV positive than those who did not report injecting drugs. There were regional variations in both the proportion of inmates who are injection drug users and the prevalence of HIV infection. Conclusions: Based on the results, it is estimated that over 600 HIV-infected individuals are admitted annually to Ontario remand facilities. Education and prevention efforts during incarceration are crucial. But: Présentation de données relatives à la prévalence de l'infection par le VIH-1 chez les hommes et les femmes adultes ainsi que chez les jeunes contrevenants incarcérés dans les prisons et les centres de détention. Méthode: Des échantillons d'urine, prélevés de façon systématique à chaque admission, ont été soumis au test de dépistage d'anticorps au VIH. Des données ont également été recueillis sur l'âge, le sexe et les antécédents d'utilisation de drogues injectables des détenus, ainsi que sur les établissements dans lequel les échantillons ont été prélevés. L'étude a porté sur 14 284 individus incarcérés dans 42 établissements de détention provisoire en Ontario, entre février et août 1993. Résultats: La prévalence de l'infection par le VIH est apparue six fois plus élevée chez les détenus que dans la population générale. Les détenus ayant des antécédents d'utilisation de drogues injectables ont de six à dix fois plus de probabilités d'être séropositifs au VIH que ceux n'ayant pas d'antécédents semblables. Des variations régionales sont apparues tant dans la proportion des détenus utilisateurs de drogues injectables que dans la prévalence de l'infection par le VIH. Conclusions: En se basant sur ces résultats, on estime que plus de 600 individus infectés par le VIH sont admis, chaque année, dans les établissements de détention provisoire en Ontario. Les efforts de prévention et de sensibilisation menés pendant la période d'incarcération provisoire sont d'une importance cruciale.

N2  - High rates of undetected mental disorder have been reported in male remand prisons. Little is known about the levels of mental disorder that are undetected among female remand prisoners. The aims of the study were to assess the prevalence of mental disorder in newly remanded female prisoners and the efficacy of the prison health screen at identifying mental disorder.Toachieve these aims consecutive female remand prisoners were screened for mental disorder at reception to prison. Diagnosis of mental disorder was compared with the findings from the standard prison health screen. There were 227 (59%) women who had at least one mental disorder (excluding substance dependence), of whom 42 (11%) were psychotic. The prison reception screening identified 81 women as having a mental disorder, and nine of them were psychotic. These results lead us to conclude that the prevalence of mental disorder, including psychoses, is very high in this population. The existing prison reception screening does not identify the majority of cases of mental disorder.

N2  - Objective:
To provide a best estimate of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among detained male adolescents, with particular emphasis on impairment, multi-informant assessment, and race or ethnicity.
Method:
Computer-assisted searches were executed to identify relevant studies.
Results:
Fifteen studies using adolescents as informants met inclusion criteria (n = 3401), of which only 2 reported within a subsample on parent-derived diagnoses. The mean prevalence of any disorder was 69.9% (95% CI 69.5% to 70.3%); with conduct disorder occurring most frequently (46.4%, 95% CI 45.6% to 47.3%), followed by substance use disorder (45.1%, 95% CI 44.6% to 45.5%), oppositional defiant disorder (19.8%, 95% CI 19.2% to 20.3%), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (13.5%, 95% CI 13.2% to 13.9%). Although lower, rates for internalizing disorders were still substantial, with any anxiety disorder found in 15.9% (95% CI 15.6% to 16.1%), major depression in 12.0% (95% CI 11.7% to 12.2%), and posttraumatic stress disorder in 9.6% (95% CI 9.2% to 10.0%). Three studies reported on psychotic disorders, finding low rates (1.35%, 95% CI 1.32% to 1.39%). Estimates of prevalence were only marginally different when impairment was not required, while consistency between adolescents and parents was poor. Findings on the relations between race or ethnicity were too scarce and inconsistent to interpret.
Conclusion:
Detained male adolescents bear substantial mental health needs, emphasizing the need to organize effective mental health services for this troubled group. However, our knowledge on mental disorders in detained youth should be enhanced, in particular regarding the reliability of adolescents, compared with parent report, and whether clinically relevant differences exist by race or ethnicity.

N2  - Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) diagnoses have demonstrated good reliability and validity in male offenders. However, there is a paucity of research assessing utilization of emotion cues in ASPD individuals and the extent to which correlates of ASPD in males generalize to females. This investigation examined emotion utilization in incarcerated men and women with and without ASPD using a lexical decision task with emotional and neutral words. The performance of male offenders with ASPD was similar to that of male controls, whereas women with ASPD demonstrated greater emotional facilitation than female controls. Moreover, the number of violent crimes committed by female inmates with ASPD was related to emotion facilitation, suggesting a link between their sensitivity to emotion cues and antisocial behavior.

N2  - Much confusion exists about federal regulations governing the enrollment of prisoners in experimental clinical trials. Given the high prevalence of HIV infection in certain incarcerated populations, the issues surrounding clinical trials need clarification. A review of the history of prisoners as human subjects and current federal regulations regarding research on prisoners is provided. Experience at two New York State Designated AIDS Centers with inmates and experimental drug trials is described. Guidelines for enrollment of inmates in clinical trials are presented.

N2  - This article describes the development of a videotape targeted at persons under supervision of the criminal justice system. The videotape seeks to encourage those who use illicit drugs to enter drug treatment and to motivate those at risk for exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to alter behaviors that may transmit infection.
The criminal justice system presents an important opportunity to deliver such messages, particularly to a large population of persons briefly detained in a jail or lockup and released without subsequent incarceration. Evidence suggests that, even in this audience, knowledge of how to prevent exposure to HIV is widespread, yet those at risk often fail to take appropriate precautions: motivating behavior change demands more than imparting information.
In order to shape this videotape, we analyzed the target audience and developed a drama-based approach that applies the framework of social learning theory, the health belief model, and principles of social marketing. This article describes the integration of that theoretical framework into the production process, content, and strategy of the videotape.

N2  - A prevalence serosurvey was performed on an 11.7% sample of the 6,503 adult male inmates in Tennessee prisons. On the basis of the sample, 0.9% of the prisoners possessed hepatitis B surface antigen, and 29.5% had one or more serum markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV). Thirty-two possible risk factors were analyzed for association with possession of HBV serum markers. The significant risk factors for possession of HBV markers in this population were found to be age, intravenous drug use while not incarcerated, intravenous drug use while incarcerated, race, education, military service history, and duration of prior and current imprisonments, in that order of importance. Given the modest contribution of incarceration to overall risk, mass immunization of prisoners against HBV seems unwarranted. Prisoners with unusually long sentences or who use intravenous drugs in prison are subgroups at particularly high risk. The logistic model can be used to target a serological screening and immunization program.

N2  - A study was conducted to determine the incidence of hepatitis B (HB) in a prison population. Forty-seven per cent of 455 male prisoners had evidence of past HB infection. HB seropositivity was most strongly correlated with: 1) a history of IV drug abuse; 2) age; 3) total time in any prison; and 4) race. During a one-year study period there were no clinical cases of HB in the prison and the seroconversion rate was 0.8 per cent among prisoners still incarcerated.

N2  - After the Russian Federation, Ukraine is the country of the Former Soviet Union experiencing the greatest epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, although complete official data are not available. This study investigates the prevalence of HIV among new TB patients in the civilian and penitentiary populations of Donetsk Oblast. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken of 1507 new patients with TB (1351 civilians, 156 prisoners) between January and June 2006. The prevalence of HIV among patients with TB was 15.5% (95% confidence interval 13.7-17.6) and 23.7% (95% CI 17.3-31.2) in the civilian and penitentiary sectors, respectively. Reported injecting drug use was the strongest independent predictor for HIV infection, followed by young age (25-44 y). Being prisoners was also found a significant independent predictor for HIV infection (OR: 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). In conclusion, the prevalence of HIV in the TB population is the highest ever reported in Ukraine, almost 2 times higher than the World Health Organization estimates for 2005 (7.9%), and 3 percentage points higher than the official data reported. These findings call for urgent measures to control HIV and, consequently, HIV-related TB.

N2  - “Sweetie” is immediately captivating.
Sweetie is a digital animation of a young girl, deployed in a series of campaign videos by a Dutch nonprofit and an advertising firm. In the videos, the computerized girl appears to look directly at the camera as she narrates a story to the viewer. “My name is Sweetie. I’m ten years old. I live in the Philippines,” she begins, the camera focused tightly on her face, only her left eye and part of her nose in the frame. Her voice is offset by subtle violin music, horror movie boilerplate for building suspense. The camera switches

N2  - We describe 225 consecutive first admissions to a medium secure unit between 1983 and 1996, and their clinical and forensic outcome 2 years and 5 years after admission. Clinical outcome includes the duration of the patients' stay, their destination on discharge and, at 2 years and 5 years after admission, their location. Forensic outcome was the absence or presence of any new convictions by 2 years and 5 years after admission. The results demonstrate that the patients were a heterogeneous group with differing needs. Over 50% had an inpatient stay exceeding 24 months, and in more than 10% of cases the admission duration exceeded 5 years, confirming the need for long-term medium secure provision. There were few further convictions. Overall, of those patients who spent any time in the community,10% were convicted of a further offence within 2 years; 14% were convicted between 2 and 5 years, some of whom had also offended in the earlier period. The only variable significantly associated with reconviction was conviction prior to the index offence leading to the MSU admission.

N2  - Summary
Offenders have been identified as heavy drinkers who admit to a relationship between drinking and offending. Many prisoners express a desire to reduce their alcohol consumption. The extent of alcohol interventions in U.K. prisons was unknown and so a postal survey was conducted to gather basic information about current work. Of all responding establishments, 91% claimed to provide services for prisoners with alcohol‐related problems and 58% gave details of these services. Services are provided mainly by probation officers/social workers, prison officers and Alcoholics Anonymous. Group and individual interventions are described. Service development has been haphazard, lacking central co‐ordination. A case is made for appointment of a central facilitator responsible for staff training, establishing a communications network, encouraging new interventions to match clients' needs, encouraging closer links with community workers and guiding evaluative research.

N2  - The Parramatta Justice Precinct in western Sydney is a state-of-the-art, technologically integrated and high security complex, home to the New South Wales State Parole Authority. Early in my research, I visited the courthouse to observe a morning of videoconferenced parole hearings. As I walked into Court 7, I was startled by the number of screens installed throughout the contemporary courtroom. I had never seen anything like it before – the courtroom felt more like a television studio or video art installation rather than a place of adjudication. I counted over 20 screens and each had the same image of a middle-aged man, staring straight ahead and dressed in a green T-shirt, standard issue of Corrective Services New South Wales. Hanging behind the man was a blue sheet with a paper notice attached at a careless angle. It read ‘Mid North Coast C.C.’.

N2  - The historical practices of archeological excavation and institutionalized containment of Indigenous dead in museums have been foundational to the formation of the American-Mexico militarized borderlands. Archeological excavation must be understood as a key surveilling technology in mediating national boundaries of land, identity, and belonging. Laws regulated the collecting and display of Native-American dead in national museums. A comparison of Arizona archeological records, newspaper articles, border patrol tactics, and forensic identification practices contextualizes the archeological removal of Indigenous dead as standing in direct correlation with the production of migrant deaths along the American-Mexico border. This approach uncovers how lasting and disappearance become important strategies for controlling this region of the country and lays bare the issues of remains repatriation, militarization, incarceration, immigration, and state violence. American excavation and institutionalized containment of the dead must be understood as enforcing and facilitating settler-colonial boundaries between life, death, land, and the body.

N2  - This case involves the examination of an ethically problematic event that arose while we were conducting an outreach/early intervention research demonstration project targeted at women who exchange sex for drugs. Subjects were drug abusers—primarily crack-cocaine smokers—recruited by outreach workers on “the street” and in jail. Participants were offered counseling, HIV and syphilis screening, and risk-reduction education. A woman who was a jail inmate tested positive for HIV. In order to obtain medical and other assistance, she would have to reveal her serostatus to jail officials. This could result in isolation and the possibility of harm from others in the jail once the information about her circulated. The case highlights the problems inherent in HIV testing of incarcerated drug abusers, especially in low HIV seroprevalence areas. We recommend that a community empanel a committee composed of substance abuse treatment and medical professionals, civil rights advocates, criminal justice personnel, and ethicists to formulate humane and effective policy in light of its drug abuse and HIV problems and its resources.

N2  - The K-BIT (Kaufman and Kaufman, 1990) and the WISC-R were administered in counterbalanced order to 40 academically deficient male juvenile delinquents (mean age = 15 years 9 months). The K-BIT IQ Composite and the WISC-R Full Scale scores were positively correlated (r = .64) and the two tests tended to yield similar scores when administered concurrently to the same person (difference = .45 points). This nonsignificant difference is in contrast to the approximately 6-point difference found between the K-BIT and WISC-R with normal (Kaufman and Kaufman, 1990) and referred (Prewett, 1992) students. The results provide support for the K-BIT as a screening instrument when the WISC-R is the follow-up or comprehensive measure of intelligence with juvenile delinquents.

N2  - This study compared the demographic and diagnostic characteristics, psychiatric histories and criminal records of female and male patients from a complete sample of Special (high-security) Hospital admissions from all health regions, and medium-security admissions from seven of fourteen regions, in England and Wales from 1988 to 1994. The annual rate of male admissions to the secure specialist services was 5.6 times that for females. Women were admitted more often as transfers from other hospitals, following non-criminalized behavioural disorder, and under the legal category 'Psychopathic Disorder'. Women were also more likely to be charged with or convicted of arson and to have previous histories of fire-setting behaviour. They had fewer previous criminal convictions and more previous psychiatric admissions. They were more likely to receive a primary diagnosis of personality disorder than men, especially borderline personality disorder. These differences suggest that new specialist therapeutic regimes for women are needed. Future research should examine their needs for internal and perimeter security and compare their needs with those of men.

N2  - To develop a protocol for prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission in Wisconsin prisons, we interviewed 619 male prisoners at incarceration to obtain information on hepatitis B risk factors. We defined previous infections by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to develop a model of relative risk (RR) of HBV infection. Use of illicit intravenous (IV) drugs was the most important risk factor because of a high prevalence of IV drug use and an RR which ranged from 2.93-7.47. Other important risk factors were: prior hepatitis or jaundice (RR = 6.28), race (RR = 2.54 for Blacks, RR = 3.28 for Latinos), transfusion (RR = 3.00), and age. Previous imprisonment was not an independent risk factor for HBV, hence selective serologic screening and vaccination of prisoners are justified rather than mass screening and vaccination. Based upon prevalence of hepatitis B markers in subgroups, it is necessary to screen prisoners with prior hepatitis or jaundice, prior transfusion, and users of IV drugs. The identification of HBsAg carriers by such screening could prevent infection of "household" contacts. Users of IV drugs who are susceptible to HBV infection should be vaccinated. The remaining prisoners constitute a low-risk group for HBV infection and do not require serologic screening or vaccination.

N2  - Summary
The consistency among a number of measures of self‐report of alcohol consumption in imprisoned male young offenders was studied by asking 56 young offenders to report, based on a ‘typical week’, how many days they had consumed alcohol, how many days they were drunk and how much alcohol they had consumed. They were asked to rate their confidence in the accuracy of their self‐report and to complete the short EPQ‐R, which contains a Lie Scale. Results show that self‐report in this population is reliable over time and that different indices of alcohol consumption correlate significantly with each other. Young offenders report a moderate degree of confidence in their accuracy of self‐report and the mean EPQ‐R Lie Scale score is within 1 standard deviation of the norm for a comparable sample.

N2  - The nucleus of my qualitative research is the empirical data gathered through interviews with 31 prisoners who used video links from NSW correctional facilities. This chapter provides an overview of this research – my methodology, research design, participants’ demographics and the difficulties of recruiting participants. There are ethical considerations inherent in prison fieldwork, especially the notion of participants’ ‘informed consent’, and I flesh out the challenges of prison as a research site and the power imbalances between a ‘free-world’ researcher and a prisoner participant. I also discuss the observations I conducted of actual court appearances while sitting behind prisoners in the prison ‘courtroom’ video suite. This chapter contributes to the growing area of qualitative prison research. The data were analysed using NVivo software to reveal three core themes of this study: spatiality, corporeality and visuality, and these themes are used to examine the central argument of this book that custodial appearance has created a heightened zone of demarcation between prisoners and courtroom participants.
This chapter provides an overview of the research–methodology, research design, participants' demographics and the difficulties of recruiting participants. It contributes to the growing area of qualitative prison research. The chapter explains how overarching methodology, research methods and theoretical framework collaborate to address the research question. It explains the value of qualitative methods and interview data specifically. The chapter describes the research design and procedures, the research participants and research site, method of empirical data collection and recording, method of coding and analysis, and the ethical considerations inherent in prison fieldwork. It presents the three core themes relating to the spatial, corporeal and visual impacts of video links from prison. A legitimate method to access subjective perspectives and to research complex, multi-layered lived experience is via interviews. The interview process provided prisoners with an opportunity to narrate their own accounts, emotional reactions and subjective opinions of the video link experience.

N2  - The psychiatric profile of a consecutive series of 69 men and women prisoners referred for assessment over a nine month period was examined. Thirty-six point two percent had a major psychiatric disorder and a further 53.6% had a minor psychiatric illness. One-third of the sample had a previous criminal record, and approximately one-half had past psychiatric contacts. Schizophrenic patients with active symptoms appear to be more likely to commit violent offenses. Often prisoners who committed murder, nine were patients with schizophrenia. Almost all the psychotic patients had active symptoms at the time that they committed their offenses. The most probable reason for the commission of their crime was psychosis. Some underlying psychosocial factors are also discussed. Ways of minimizing the vulnerability and victimization of individuals with serious mental disorders are suggested. Because this was a highly selective sample, the results should be viewed with some caution. More research is needed to determine the criminal behaviour of the mentally ill in general, and schizophrenics in particular.

N2  - Plasma concentrations of eight large and neutral amino acids and 10 acidic metabolites of biogenic amines in seven inmates incarcerated in the Regional Psychiatric Centre (Prairies), Correctional Service of Canada, were assessed each week day for 4 weeks (i.e., 20 samples each). Measures of central tendency and dispersion of the variables were calculated. The measures are distinctivelydifferent in their variability and their normality of distribution. The large and neutral amino acid (LNAA) measures are somewhat less variable, but also less likely to be normally distributed than most acid metabolites. Acid metabolites tend to show consistent interindividual differences that persist over time, with the notable exception of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. LNAA measures tend to show differences across time but not between individuals. The distributional properties of LNAA measures are largely accounted for by the observation of a downward convergence of values of these variables over the 4 weeks of the study.

N2  - This article describes a cognitive-behavioral program for substance abusers which was first implemented in the Baltimore City Jail in 1987. Similar but separate programs are provided for male and female inmates, consisting of twelve to sixteen contact hours over three to four weeks. In addition to conventional drug and alcohol information (physiologic and psychological effects, treatment options), the program emphasizes cognitive and behavioral skills which can prevent substance abuse, including training in consequential thinking, and stress and anger management. Over a two-year period, 607 males and 131 females were served, of whom 429 (59%) completed the entire program. Both males and females showed statistically significant improvement from pretest to posttest in all knowledge areas. Inmates gave high ratings to the program and group leaders reported substantial change in client attitudes toward drug and alcohol use. Knowledge scores at the end of the program were highest for those who scored higher at pretest, rated their group leader higher, and were rated by their group leader as more active participants. Client participation was the strongest predictor of program outcome.

N2  - The Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (ADAM) Program collects self-report survey information and urine specimens from adult arrestees in 35 cities nationwide. In 2000, a new survey instrument was fielded that includes questions about alcohol and other drug (AOD) abuse and dependence. Despite high levels of drug use among national arrestee populations, no studies have examined need for AOD treatment among ADAM arrestees. To address this limitation, a secondary analysis was undertaken with New York City ADAM data collected in 2000. Thirty-seven percent of the arrestees were diagnosed in need of drug treatment, while 19% were diagnosed in need of alcohol treatment. Compared to those arrestees who were diagnosed as not needing AOD treatment, arrestees who met the criteria for ADAM abuse/dependence were more likely to be male, older, and to have tested positive by urinalysis for at least one illicit drug. Because “need for treatment” was operationalized as a diagnosis of abuse
or dependence, the current results should be viewed as liberal estimates of treatment need. Implications for the delivery of drug treatment to criminal populations are discussed.

of male prison inmates. Scores on the revised Psychopathy Checklist were used to divide inmates in each sample into high, moderate, and low psychopathy groups. There were no group differences in test performance in either of the samples, even when the effects of self-reported psychopathology and substance abuse were taken into account. The overall prevalence of both test-specific and global neuropsychological impairment was low and did not vary significantly across the 3 groups. The results provide no support for traditional brain-damage explanations of psychopathy.

N2  - Foucault (1977: 297) suggests that the rise of the penitentiary and other disciplined institutions caused what he terms a ‘carceral archipelago’ to emerge across late eighteenth-century Western Europe and North America. This geographic idiom, which presents disciplined institutions as a chain of islands dotted across a nondisciplinary landscape, is adopted in order to explain his postulated shift from a society of spectacle to one of surveillance (1977: 217). According to Foucault, the modern technologies of selfhood first developed in these isolated ‘discipline-blockades’ (1977: 209), before detaching themselves and spreading their now subtle mechanisms across the social body.

Sera were collected on 363 newly incarcerated inmates, 389 inmates returning to prison, and 107 forensic psychiatric patients. Three of the 859 serum samples (0.3 per cent) tested during this study were reactive by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) testing, but none reactive by the Western blot. Analysis for AIDS risk factors included a high prior IV-drug use rate (22-50 per cent) and a low admitted homosexuality rate in a predominantly young white male population.

N2  - In penal settings it is important to be able to quickly discriminate which kinds of self-destructive behaviours carry a larger suicide potential and which inmates present a greater suicide risk. This paper is a preliminary report of the first phase of a suicide research project conducted at the Calgary Remand Centre, Calgary, Alberta which has entailed the development of a tool for screening potentially suicidal inmates. The Suicide Checklist was designed for use by the nursing staff of the Centre to provide a screening process which would be: (a) reliable; (b) valid (within the broad constraints and difficulties inherent in any attempt to predict dangerousness to self); (c) standardized; (d) quick and feasible to implement; and (e) a combination of clinical and past history variables. This paper identifies some of the issues which have surrounded the development of this tool and presents findings from an initial reliability study.

N2  - CONTEXT Adolescents in juvenile detention facilities present a unique opportunity to diagnose and treat sexually transmitted diseases. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness and costs of different strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of chlamydial infection in adolescents in juvenile detention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS For a cohort of adolescents in a juvenile detention facility, sex-specific decision models were developed comparing strategies for diagnosing and treating chlamydial infection. These strategies included not screening, treating everyone, and testing (with leukocyte esterase [LE], ligase chain reaction [LCR], or history and symptoms) followed by treatment for those with positive test results. Two different time horizons were considered: immediate and extended. In the immediate time horizon, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis looking only at the outcomes associated with treating current infections; in the extended time horizon, we performed a cost-minimization analysis comparing the estimated total costs of diagnosing and treating Chlamydia as well as those associated with complications occurring up to 20 years in the future. RESULTS In males, the immediate-time-horizon evaluation revealed that treating on the basis of urine LE results produced the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($80 per infection treated). In the extended-time-horizon cost-minimization analysis, treating males on the basis of urine LE results was again found to be the least expensive strategy ($10.11 per person). Two other strategies, confirming urine LE results with LCR ($10.96 per person) and screening with urine LCR ($14.04 per person), were found to be less expensive than not screening ($16.66 per person). In females, the immediate-time-horizon evaluation found that treating on the basis of symptoms and history resulted in treating about half the cases of chlamydial infection and produced the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($74 per infection treated). More infections were treated when treatment was based on urine LCR results with only a small increase in the incremental cost per case treated ($95 per infection treated). In the extended-time-horizon cost-minimization analysis, treating all females empirically and treating based on results of urine LCR testing were the least expensive strategies ($18.81 and $18.98 per person, respectively). The results were sensitive to several variables, including prevalence of chlamydial infection, in both males and females. CONCLUSIONS For adolescent males in juvenile detention facilities, screening with urine LE minimizes the costs associated with diagnosis, treatment, and sequelae of urogenital chlamydial infection. For adolescent females in juvenile detention, empiric treatment and that based on urine LCR test results are the optimal strategies for managing urogenital chlamydial infection.

N2  - Of 37 female adolescent prostitutes and 63 other females held in the King County, Washington, juvenile detention facility, 81 (81%) complained of vaginal discharge, and only eight (8%) had no genitourinary symptoms. The prevalence of genital infections among prostitutes and nonprostitutes was similar. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was found in 18 (18%) of 98 detainees tested, and Chlamydia trachomatis was found in 17 (20%) of 86 detainees tested; either organism was found in 27 (32%) of 85 tested for both organisms. Also, 38 (48%) of 80 tested had trichomoniasis. No detainees had syphilis. Sixty-seven (68%) of 98 responding detainees used no contraception. Such populations deserve the attention of public programs for control of sexually transmitted diseases and for family planning.

N2  - This chapter provides a general context for the reimagining chapters in their forms – personal, legal/judicial, moral and social. Within this, our specific concern is to understand what social control may mean and how it may be experienced by both probation staff as well as those they supervise. Our approach draws on the conceptual insights offered by the late Stan Cohen in his seminal work Visions of Social Control. Although published in 1985 and before the ubiquitous application of digital technology to our personal and professional lives, it remains both relevant to our understanding of current realities and still capable of pointing us in the direction of a less coercive and more humanistic approach to the rehabilitative endeavour. We draw on Cohen’s insistence that both good and justice are values that should underpin a moral pragmatism to social interventions that go beyond achieving simply utilitarian ends. Indeed, he shows through the pursuit of utilitarian policies within criminal justice, a dystopian spread of both soft (community) and hard end (incarceration) social control emerging during latter part of the twentieth century. Indeed, we can now evidence its continuation across European and American criminal justice jurisdictions as both mass supervision and mass incarceration.
In this chapter, the authors provide a broad sweep of conceptual insights to support their normative position to reimagine rehabilitation within a broader context of social action and social change. S. Cohen's work also provides a cautionary tale about the relationship between rehabilitation and penal expansion. The authors include an analysis of to what extent the dystopian elements of Cohen's vision have now been realised as more recent technological developments within a digital world have extended the nature of surveillance and control. The authors consider electronic monitoring (EM) as an example, par excellence, of what M. Nellis refers to as a 'distinct and particular socio-technical practice'. They argue that the bureaucratic environment of corrections is shaped not simply by the deployment of hard end technologies like EM but also by information and communication technologies; probation practice is significantly driven by technologies that reflect the wider capabilities of technological societies.

N2  - The high-security hospitals of England and Wales are entering a phase of major retraction, with local security services embarking upon the reprovision of services for patients with longer-term needs who do not require high security. The large area mental hospitals underwent similar changes and the lessons that may be learnt from this process are relevant to proposed changes in forensic services. These lessons include: (1) the risk of over-optimistic predictions concerning the time-scale and resources required for major bed reduction; (2) the problems associated with 'creaming off', with the risk of increasing acuity in the residual inpatient population accompanied by deterioration in the quality of the retracting services; (3) the risk of 'silting up' in the reprovided services in the absence of an appropriate community infrastructure; and (4) the importance of quality of life for longer-stay secure inpatients. This paper urges caution in view of the potentially serious clinical and organizational risks associated with these major changes in forensic services.

Difficulties and complexities in understanding and diagnosing PTSD in former POWs presenting symptomatic complaints associated with this disorder are explored. Data collected on former POWs complaining of PTSD and diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria revealed Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) clinical profiles appropriate for clinical application. Comparative data between German-held and Japanese-held POWs experiencing PTSD and adjustment-related stressors are discussed. Import on clinical strategies with diagnosed patients suggests both behavioral approaches to treatment and future directions in research.

N2  - The bullying that occurs among patients in secure hospitals is a neglected area of research. We describe bullying, highlight some of the definitional problems associated with this concept, present a typology of bullying and summarize the available research. The importance of taking into account research conducted in other secure settings, namely prisons, is highlighted and this is used to inform a model that describes why bullying is expected to occur in secure settings. We discuss why patient-to-patient bullying should be addressed in secure settings by looking at some of the consequences of bullying and conclude with some suggestions for management.

N2  - This study examined 1757 incarcerated felons to determine personality, social history, and intellectual characteristics associated with dropping out of school. A stepwise discriminant function analysis compared junior high and high school dropouts with high school completors on variables including the Wide-Range Achievement Test, the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery and the Millon Clinical Multi-axial Inventory. A significant discriminant function differentiated the three groups on reading level, substance abuse history, age, verbal IQ, and the personality factors of dependency and borderline personality. Results validate the use of the WRAT and MAB for incarcerated populations, and identify personality factors to be considered in rehabilitative efforts with felons who have not completed high school.

N2  - In the past decade, tablets have become increasingly common inside carceral facilities. They can be used for communication with families, ordering commissary, documenting a grievance, playing games, reading ebooks, and a variety of other activities that are generally welcomed by incarcerated people. However, technology always brings new challenges to bear as well. Here, Kinnon talks about the use of electronic devices to conduct additional surveillance on incarcerated people and their communications, their reading, and any other tasks they undertake on the tablet.

N2  - In 1985 a high HIV‐seroprevalence (44.2%) was found in a cohort of parenteral drug addicted prisoners in Innsbruck, Austria. In a longitudinal study from March 1985 to March 1989 we investigated the epidemiology of HIV‐infection as well as possible changes in the drug taking behaviour of this defined population at risk. During the study HIV‐seroprevalence rates in drug dependent prisoners showed a statistical decrease to 30%. A concomitant increase in admission to any kind of therapy programmes as well as an increasing change from ‘heavy use’ (mainly taking heroin i.v.) to ‘non‐heavy use’ (mainly taking drugs orally) could be noted. The influence of preventive measures, such as comprehensive AIDS‐information, special therapy programmes including the methadone substitution programme, and the unrestricted availability of needles and syringes is discussed.

N2  - Can a robot or an algorithm be racist? A simple question with a very simple answer. The reason why there is some confusion in the varied responses to this question is directly related to how much context and history is known about what goes into the computer programming. If the programmer knows little or nothing about the substance of the matter (e.g., from outside their own culture), the chances are very high that the seeming neutrality of “data in” will miss when there is racism embedded in the algorithm.

N2  - Forty‐nine opiate‐dependent persons entering remand prison were treated with methadone over 5–10 days in decreasing doses according to standard practice of the prison medical service. The prisoners were mainly young, unmarried men with an average of 5 years regular opiate use and an average of four previous imprisonments; 45% were known to be HIV infected, although routine testing was not carried out. Ten were on methadone maintenance prior to imprisonment. Urine analysis on entry detected an average of three psychoactive substances, principally opiates, benzodiazepines and cannabis. Prescribed starting doses of methadone were not correlated to independently assessed withdrawal severity. Starting doses were related to prisoners' requests and to their age. Withdrawal severity decreased after 4 days treatment but symptom relief was incomplete. Treating withdrawal symptoms on entry to prison poses unsolved ethical and practical problems.

N2  - In November 2015, writer and antiracist activist Shaun King penned a widely circulated op-ed in the New York Daily News titled “Predictive Policing Is ‘Technological Racism.’” In it, King raises a version of what data scientists call the “garbage in, garbage out” problem. In so many words: Any automated system will only ever be as good as the data it is based on. The racist history of American policing means that any predictive system’s data are garbage. Therefore, predictive policing programs will be racist garbage.¹ This is true, but the framing raises an inevitable counterpoint. If it were possible to

N2  - The hormonal profile of 40 transsexual inmates from a pool of 86 inmates in the California State prison system was studied before and after therapy with feminizing hormones. Clinical and social data were obtained on all 86 inmates; the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity was examined in 76 of the 86 individuals.
Despite similar degrees of feminization in all 40 individuals in whom hormonal studies were performed, variable suppression of serum testosterone concentrations was present. Based on their testosterone concentrations while on feminizing hormone therapy, the transsexual inmates could be divided into three groups. In Group I (the "suppressed" group), the serum testosterone concentrations were markedly depressed (< 10 ng/dL); in Group II (the "nonsuppressed" group), the values of testosterone were normal (446 to 1072 ng/dL); and in Group III ( the "intermediate" group), the testosterone values were between those of the suppressed group and the nonsuppressed group. We speculate that feminizing hormone therapy may induce the development of a state of target hormone resistance to testosterone that results in similar degrees of feminization independent of the circulating concentrations of testosterone.
The incidence of HIV seropositivity (3/76) was considerably less than anticipated based on previous studies in populations at high risk for developing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

N2  - In the change in the paradigm of power from the monarchic to the disciplinary traced by Michel Foucault in his grand genealogies, there is also a tendency to effect an expulsion of law. Foucault contends that power has changed in its nature from being centrist and repressive to being diffuse, micro-level and creative. Power has become normative and normalising. The most important sites of power now are not monarchic ones, but instead, the prison, the school, the doctor's surgery, one's own friends and neighbours and ultimately, one's own (constructed) conscience. Foucault goes on from this diagnosis to state that law no longer connects with power, it exists on a different scale and operates through different and outdated modes. It is the argument of this thesis that Foucault makes these claims about law only because he does not pause to understand fully the nature of law. This thesis will attempt to establish that law is a much more social and diffuse mechanism than Foucault was prepared to concede. Subsequently, it will be argued that in fact despite the tenor of the better known of Foucault's remarks about the law, there are also suggestions in his work about a new meld between law and discipline, and the creation of a combined, synergistic normative framework. Finally, briefly, there will be an analysis of ways in which resistance can be effected through the law. Hence the law is by no means irrelevant as Foucault sometimes claimed, instead it is critical and a potential source of hope in 'the carceral archipelago'.

N2  - Models based on modern theories of anxiety were used to develop a hypothesis concerned with the relationship of anxiety and/or the tendency to aggressive behavior and the tendency to depressive reactions in prisoners. Anxiety, aggression and depression scales were the instruments used in this study. Special emphasis was placed on the question as to whether there is a quantitative difference in anxiety and aggression in non-working as compared with working prisoners. Significant differences were found between working and non-working prisoners with regard to anxiety and depression. A difference was also calculated for the parameter of reactive aggression. In the following the far-reaching implications of these results for penological practice and perspectives for further studies are discussed.

N2  - All 87 women patients who were detained in Broadmoor Hospital during the first 6 months of 1994 are described in terms of their demographic and offence characteristics, their behaviours prior to and during admission, their diagnostic categories and treatment needs. Histories of sexual victimization and physical abuse were present in a substantial number of the population. Acts of self-harm represented a more significant management problem (present in 94% of women) than aggression towards others. The most common behaviours leading to admission were assault (71.3%) and arson (47.1%), although 23% of the women had not been convicted of any offence. The findings are discussed with reference to the need to develop within secure settings psychotherapeutic approaches that reflect the complexity of these women's lives as well as the multiple levels of trauma most have experienced.

N2  - This paper reports ethnographic findings on current approaches to drug treatment for women offenders. Drug treatment programs serving women offenders have employed a range of therapeutic interventions to address drug use and criminality. However, programs have recently begun to address clients’ victimization experiences as an integral if not central feature of women’s drug use and participation in illegal activities. Treatment approaches at eight corrections- and community-based programs in New York City and Portland, Oregon are described. Data were obtained from life history interviews conducted with 60 women and observation of treatment activities. Developments in treatment approaches in corrections versus community settings and gender-specific services are described. Programs have tailored treatment approaches for women offenders by offering incest and domestic violence survivor groups, assigning therapeutic rather than punitive sanctions, and training corrections staff to support treatment goals.

N2  - Aboriginal deaths in custody have become an issue of national concern and international attention. Amongst those dying are an increasing number who commit suicide. In the heated and tense arena of this politicized debate there are many views but little to back them up. The author examines the international literature on deaths in custody, draws from work on Aboriginal suicide in the Kimberley, including two suicides in police custody, and reports the finding of a survey of 100 prisoners conducted in the police cells in Broome. With the final report of the Muirhead Royal Commission several years away, it is imperative that all sources of information be examined to guide policy changes in the present.

N2  - Numerous serosurveys have shown male prisoners to have a higher prevalence of serum markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV) than is found in the general population. The extent to which that higher prevalence was due to infection acquired during incarceration, however, has remained uncertain. Indeed, recent studies have indicated that the high prevalences of HBV serum markers found in prisoners were attributable primarily to factors not directly associated with incarceration. Unfortunately, there has been no accurate information concerning the incidence of hepatitis B among prisoners. In order to determine the incidence of hepatitis B among adult male inmates of Tennessee prisons, the authors surveyed again (in 1984) those prisoners who were found by their 1983 survey to be susceptible to hepatitis B and who were still incarcerated.

N2  - An investigation of three suspected cases of pulmonary histoplasmosis among 600 employees at a New York prison in a nonendemic area resulted in identification of 12 additional previously unrecognized cases. The 15 cases presented with diagnostic findings between February 1978 and October 1981; 10 were in prison employees, three in inmates and two in community persons. Unlike other outbreaks, cases presented over several years with chronic pulmonary lesions in the absence of an episode marked by acute respiratory illnesses. Of the 13 prison-associated cases, seven had undergone diagnostic thoracotomies for chest x-ray abnormalities. A skin test survey of a random sample of employees showed 53% to have positive histoplasmin skin tests compared with 11% in a community control population (x2=23.4,p<0.001). Over 63% of employees on the job for two or more years reacted positively compared with only 13% of those employed less than two years. Testing of some inmates showed 84% with residence of two years or more to be positive, compared with 20% for those with less than two years. A review of potential exposure sources revealed three sites where bird dropping accumulations had been cleared in 1978–1979. Four specimens from two of these areas were positive for Histoplasma capsulatum. The affected sites were treated with a 3% formalin solution and there have been no subsequent cases.

N2  - I determined the best corrected acuity of 90 prisoners. The data were compared to available published visual acuity data for the general population and to 6/6 (20/20) as the assumed normal. The prison population differed significantly from the population analyzed in one reported study but not from that in another (p < 0.05). Comparison to the assumed normal of 6/6 showed no statistical difference. The differences among the studies are discussed. The data suggest that for this population corrected visual acuity may not be dissimilar from that of the general population.

N2  - Les taux de prévalence de consommation de drogues illicites dans les milieux carcéraux s'avèrent beaucoup plus élevés que ceux de la population canadienne en général. Parmi les substances consommées en détention, les drogues injectables sont celles qui préoccupent davantage les autorités pénitentiaires et de santé publique, vu que la haute prévalence des maladies transmissibles par le sang dans ces milieux peut être imputable au partage de matériel destiné à l'injection de drogues. Aux prises avec cette situation, le Service correctionnel du Canada met actuellement en pratique quelques stratégies de réduction de méfaits ciblant les détenus usagers de drogues injectables, tels les programmes d'entretien à la méthadone et l'accès à de l'eau de javel. Toutefois, malgré son utilisation dans la communauté, les programmes d'échange de seringues ne sont pas encore acceptés dans les pénitenciers. Cet article analyse les limites des stratégies de réduction des méfaits actuellement approuvées par les autorités carcérales et discute les sources de résistance qui continuent à empêcher la réalisation d'un projet pilote pour évaluer la faisabilité des programmes d'échange de seringues en détention au Canada. The prevalence rates of illicit drug consumption within the prison system are much higher than those in the Canadian population in general. Of the substances used in detention, those of most concern to prison and public health authorities are injection drugs, as the sharing of injection drug equipment may be responsible for the high prevalence of bloodborne diseases in prison facilities. Faced with this situation, the Correctional Service of Canada put in practice a number of harm reduction strategies targeting injection drug users, such as méthadone maintenance programs and access to bleach. However, despite their use in the community, needle-exchange programs are not yet allowed in penitentiaries. This article analyzes the limits of harm reduction strategies approved by the prison authorities and discusses the sources of resistance that continue to impede the realization of a pilot project to assess the feasibility of needle-exchange programs in detention in Canada.

N2  - OBJECTIVES To determine the utility of urine-based ligase chain reaction assays for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in (1) the acceptability of such testing to adolescent detainees, (2) the potential use of these tests for identifying asymptomatic infections, and (3) the effectiveness of this approach for ensuring treatment of infected adolescents. DESIGN Cross-sectional screening and verification of treatment for infected cases. SUBJECTS Adolescents admitted to a short-term juvenile detention center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neisseria gonorrhoeaeand C trachomatis infection rates, and timing and location of treatment for infected patients. RESULTS Refusal rate was 1.5%. Of 263 participants, 46 (17.5%) were female subjects. Chlamydia trachomatis infections were identified in 28.3% of the female and 8.8% of the male subjects. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections were present in 13.1% of the female and 2.8% of the male subjects. Overall, 37 participants (14%) were positive for N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, or both, only one of whom had symptoms. Almost 70% (25/36) of asymptomatic infected subjects were treated within 28 days of screening. A treatment was documented in 36 of the 37 infected youth, including 20 who were followed up and treated after release from the detention center, by 6 months after testing. CONCLUSION Urine ligase chain reaction tests were effective for identifying and guiding treatment of unsuspected N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections in teenagers admitted to a short-term detention center where traditional swab specimens may be difficult to obtain.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1998;152:52-56-->

N2  - Empirical data comparing DSM-III and DSM-III-R criteria on conduct disorders were obtained from 100 adolescent juvenile justice center residents. The importance of an ongoing classification of childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders, with primary emphasis on the diagnosis of conduct disorders, was stressed. Demographic and associated features were presented. DSM-III-R seemed superior to its predecessor in some respects and the severity index in particular may be useful. Direction for further classification modification was suggested.

N2  - The sexual behaviour and intravenous drug use (IVDU) of a sample of 559 inmates (480 males and 79 females) was investigated. Sexual behaviour and IVDU prior to imprisonment, during imprisonment, and that expected after release, was assessed. Alterations in sexual behaviour as a means of HIV risk reduction was also assessed in relation to IVDU status. Prior to imprisonment most IVDUs and non-IVDUs engaged in unprotected intercourse. Sexual behaviour during imprisonment, as reported by inmates, was almost negligible for both groups. Expected sexual behaviour after imprisonment differed little from that before imprisonment for both IVDUs and non-IVDUs. Selecting partners more carefully and reducing their number was the most common method of HIV risk reduction for both IVDUs and non-IVDUs prior to imprisonment and was expected to be increasingly so after release. There was little difference in the sexual behaviour of IVDUs and non-IVDUs prior to imprisonment, during imprisonment, and as expected after release. However, IVDU inmates were more likely to have had an IVDU sexual partner than did non-IVDU inmates. Those IVDU inmates who had an HIV test, and those who had an IVDU sexual partner, were more likely to expect to continue IVDU after imprisonment. IVDU inmates, who had an IVDU sexual partner, were also more likely to have shared injected equipment but no more likely to have sterilized injecting equipment than did IVDU inmates whose sexual partner was not involved with IVDU. Results are discussed in relation to risk of HIV transmission for IVDUs and their sexual partners.

But my father was an anthropologist, who spent his whole career looking at interracial marriage. I recently discovered that my mother also helped him with this project.

N2  - The incidence of hearing disorders in 34 State Penitentiary prison inmates all with a previous history of drug abuse were investigated. Subjects were evaluated using routine pure-tone air conduction audiometry, immittance measures, and short-latency auditory brain stem responses. Of the 34 inmates, 20 (58.8%) demonstrated normal bilateral peripheral hearing sensitivity, whereas 10 (29.4%) inmates presented with some degree of hearing impairment. In addition, the conflicting results of elevated pure-tone thresholds with normal immittance measures and normal ABR findings suggested that four (11.8%) subjects exhibited functional hearing loss. The results of this study support the reported high incidence of hearing loss in the prison population. The synergistic affects of drug abuse, noise exposure, and head trauma as possible contributing factors are discussed.

N2  - To investigate the hypothesis that psychopaths allocate most of their attentional capacity to stimuli and responses of immediate interest, we assessed psychopaths' dual-task performance under two instructional sets. Using
Hare's (1980)
checklist, we classified 72 white male prison inmates as psychopaths or nonpsychopaths. We predicted that psychopaths would divide attention adequately between a visual search and probe-reaction time task, but that when instructions defined the search as subjects' primary task, psychopaths would overfocus on it and outperform nonpsychopaths at the cost of relatively poor secondary task performance. The results of our study challenge the utility of the overfocusing hypothesis. Subject groups performed equally well on the search when it received instructional priority, but psychopaths made more search errors (
p
< .01) under divided-attention instructions. Psychopaths also responded more slowly than nonpsychopaths to auditory probes (
p
< .05) across conditions. The results suggest that psychopaths may incur relatively large capacity costs in attempting to shift their attentional resources between processing tasks.

N2  - Semi‐structured interviews on the consequences for preschool children of a parent's detention were conducted with primary caregivers of 19 South African children aged 2–6 yrs. Caregivers reported emotional problems, separation anxiety and fear as well as physical problems, aggression, secondary enuresis and developmental difficulties. Adaptive mechanisms arc described. Fantasies focused chiefly on children's images of the detention situation, and on plans to alter current circumstances, Children who felt secure in the environment seemed generally to adjust better to the experience, particularly in the long term.

N2  - Forty‐four male prison inmates convicted for violent offences were interviewed, and details of current offence, previous convictions for violence, prison incidents, and violent situations outside of prison were obtained from each offender. Information on victim, circumstances, precipitating events, type of violence, emotions at the time, and the like, was derived for 246 violent incidents. Cluster analysis revealed eight clusters: “criminal” violence to familiar victims, peer violence within prison, domestic violence, peer violence in pubs, gang violence, violence to staff in prison, “criminal” violence to unknown victims with accomplices, and public violence against younger victims. Results were discussed in terms of treatment of violent offenders, with special emphasis on Social Skills Training.

N2  - It has been recommended that there should be new therapeutic regimes for women who need secure inpatient services. Cluster analysis was applied to the diagnoses of 471 women admitted to Special Hospitals and medium secure units over a 7-year period from a geographically representative area of seven health regions in the UK. The aim was to identify categories that may facilitate the development of new specialist services. A seven-cluster solution revealed three subgroups of women with personality disorder as their primary psychopathology, three with major mental illness, and one with organic brain syndrome. Each may require different therapeutic regimes and levels of inpatient security. Further research is necessary to determine whether any single category could be managed in specialist facilities without recourse to high perimeter security. High security will continue to be needed for women with anti-social personality disorder.

N2  - To many techno-euphorists, the digital economy is the place where race no longer matters. This would be an even playing field. It would happen through an online market where goods, services, and labor could be exchanged without direct contact between individuals, at times anonymously. How could racism occur under conditions like this, when a person’s ethnic or national identity is not readily apparent?
For some, the digital is even a place where racial inequalities are rectified. This logic is front and center among corporate narratives.¹ Uber’s head of North American operations stated: “Ridesharing apps are changing a transportation status quo

N2  - HIV infection among prisoners in Italy and in other Western countries has been little studied (1), even though this population group is likely to be considered at high risk of infection. Between July 1985 and March 1986 a survey was carried out to study the prevalence of HIV infection among male inmates in the county jails of three neighbouring cities (Pordenone, Udine and Gorizia) in northeastern Italy. The percentage of intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) seropositive prisoners differs notably between the two groups; 33 of 91 IVDA prisoners were positive (36.3%, 95% C.I.: 26.4% to 46.1%) while only three of the 38 subjects from the group not at increased risk were positive (7.9%, 95% C.I.: 0.1% to 16.5%). The median duration of imprisonment for the HIV-positive individuals was 12 months (range one to 96 months), while the duration of imprisonment of the three HIV-positive individuals not belonging to increased risk groups was 24, 30 and 84 months, respectively.

N2  - For as long as it has existed, our Australian society has been attempting to deal with addiction and criminal behaviour. Both crime and the taking of illicit drugs are reflections of the divisions, hatreds and wretchedness that have long existed within our society and within the individuals that comprise it. The prison, as a micro-society, brings the larger problems into an intense focus, with consequent difficulties for those who must administer it. This essay is concerned with those difficulties, their history and their management.

N2  - Nonpsychiatric and nonobstetrical principal diagnoses of 527 prison inmates discharged in 1981 from one referral hospital were reviewed. Male prisoners had the following discharge diagnoses more frequently than an age-matched and sex-matched sample of the general population: lymphadenopathy, viral hepatitis, foreign body insertion into the gastrointestinal tract, dental caries, and pulmonary tuberculosis. Some differences may be due to lifestyles preceding incarceration, others may result from conditions of the prison environment.

N2  - During a 6-month period from July 1 through December 31, 1986, 2,598 consecutive men were screened for gonorrhea upon entry into the Maryland Division of Corrections. Twenty-eight men (1.1%) demonstrated positive cultures for gonorrhea with 27 of them (92%) asymptomatic. This prevalence is substantially lower than other rates reported from prisons and detention centers. Although the role of asymptomatic males as a reservoir for gonorrhea has been well delineated, standard recommendations for screening high-risk male populations such as prison inmates have not been established. These data suggest that screening in some correctional facilities may not be cost-effective given the low prevalence observed. In addition, contact tracing may be delayed by long holding periods in local detention facilities prior to transfer to the state prison system. These data underscore the need for additional analysis to determine the most effective program structure for screening in correctional facilities and detention centers.

N2  - A group of 20 imprisoned heroin addicts was compared on 4 personality dimensions with a group of non-addict fellow prisoners and a group of normal controls. The 4 personality measures examined were level of self-esteem, perceived locus of control, tendency to self-deception and tendency to project a flattering self-image. The addict group was significantly lower in self-esteem and significantly less inclined to project a flattering self-image than the normal controls. However the addicts were similar to their fellow prisoners on all the psychological measures. The addict and non-addict prisoners were also similar in respect of various socioeconomic indices and criminal history. The belief that one could give up use of heroin without outside help was found to distinguish a subgroup of addicts who were at an earlier stage in the addiction process. However this subgroup did not differ from the more experienced addicts on the 4 psychological measures.

N2  - In the context of visual criminology, Chapter 6 examines how the prisoner is visually constructed and represented in criminal process by videoconferencing. Referencing historical methods of delineating criminal taxonomies as well as Foucault’s panoptic schema, I argue that a new ‘observatory’ of criminality has appeared, an instrument of power and control where the prisoner is reduced to a two-dimensional image. In particular, I examine the stigmatisation of the prisoner and the notion of presumptive guilt as a result of their framed screen appearance, dressed in prison uniform and with a prison banner behind. Drawing on my fieldwork interviews, I argue that the emergent visual bias is a function of a number of factors including the prisoners’ attire, the aesthetic setting of the prison video studio and the designated framing by technology. In other words, the appearance from the site of incarceration, and all the inequality that this implies, are what makes this visual demarcation problematic. As such, videoconferencing is construed as a continuum of technological representations of criminality, a new typology and a visual demarcation.
This chapter argues that a new 'observatory' of criminality has appeared, an instrument of power and control where the prisoner is reduced to a two-dimensional image. It examines the stigmatisation of the prisoner and the notion of presumptive guilt as a result of their framed screen appearance, dressed in prison uniform and with a prison banner behind. The chapter argues that the emergent visual bias is a function of a number of factors including the prisoners' attire, the aesthetic setting of the prison video studio and the designated framing by technology. It examines videoconferencing in the context of criminal justice's growing emphasis on the visual and examines the repercussions of prisoners appearing by video link on a screen and dressed in prison attire. The discipline of criminology has seen an increasing engagement with 'visuality, representation, and the spectacle of crime, punishment, and justice', what Carrabine refers to as a 'visual turn'.

N2  - Brown and Crutchfield discuss how the founding of the new digital humanities project #BlkTwitterstorians is the story of a new iteration of the long Black freedom struggle compelling us to ask new questions, challenging us to create new forms of knowledge, and pushing us to share this knowledge through relatively new digital tools. Though #BlkTwitterstorians is a twenty-first-century digitally born project, it connects to part of the much longer Black radical tradition that works outside of universities and institutions. #BlkTwitterstorians responds to the growing racial consciousness and yearning for Black history that is in conversation with the issues we face today like: filmed evidence of persisting police brutality, the racialized effects of a carceral state, the increasing wealth gap, political and social disenfranchisement, and the urgent need for more intersectional analysis of all of these matters. For this reason, our project extends far beyond our initial audience and inspirations of supporting Black academia in ways that many institutions do not. People of different backgrounds and different parts of the world cite, utilize, and refine content produced in the chat.

N2  - 31 Italian HIV-infected patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB) were reviewed to verify the effectiveness of the most common antituberculosis drugs. The patients were mostly intravenous drug addicts (90%), and 14 (45%) had recently been in prison. 5 patients (16%) had pulmonary TB, 15 (48%) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary involvement, and 11 (30%) had extrapulmonary disease alone. 6 patients received the association of HRZ, and a 4-drug association including ethambutol was given to an additional 7 patients. The remaining 18 patients were administered the association of HRE. Response to therapy was good in 13 patients (42%), and lacking or delayed in 18 patients (58%). Treatment failure was partly related to the increased occurrence in our area of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to the first-line antituberculosis drugs. These observations, along with the need of a faster response to therapy than that currently obtained for TB in AIDS and in view of epidemiological effects, should prompt the definition of alternative therapeutic and prophylactic regimens.
31 patients italiens infectés à la fois par le VIH et par une tuberculose (TB) récemment diagnostiquée ont été revus afin de vérifier l'efficacité des médicaments antituberculeux les plus communs. La majorité des patients était toxicomane (90%), et 14 (45%) avaient récemment subi un séjour carcéral. 5 patients (16%) étaient atteints d'une tuberculose pulmonaire, 15 (45%) avaient une atteinte à la fois pulmonaire et extra-pulmonaire, et 11 (30%) étaient atteints d'une maladie seulement extrapulmonaire. 6 patients ont reçu l'association HRZ; une association de 4 médicaments incluant l'éthambutol a été donnée à 7 autres; les 18 patients restant ont reçu l'association HRE. La réponse au traitement à été positive chez 13 des patients (42%) et absente ou retardée chez 18 (58%). L'échec du traitement était dû en partie à l'incidence croissante dans notre région de souches de
Mycobacterium tuberculosis résistantes aux médicaments antituberculeux de première ligne. Ces observations, ainsi que la nécessité en cas d'association TB et SIDA d'une réponse au traitement plus rapide que celle habituellement obtenue et en vue des effets épidémiologiques, devraient conduire à définir des régimes thérapeutiques et prophylactiques alternatifs.
Se revisa los casos de 31 pacientes italianos infectados con VIH y con tuberculosis recientemente diagnosticada, a fin de verificar la eficacia de los medicamentos antituberculosos más comunes. El 90% de los pacientes era toxicómanos por vía endovenosa y 14 (45%) habían estado recientemente en prisión. 5 pacientes (16%) tenían una tuberculosis pulmonar. 15 (48%) tenían un compromiso tanto pulmonar como extrapulmonar y 11 (30%) una enfermedad solamente extrapulmonar. 6 pacientes recibieron la asociación HRZ; otros 7 pacientes recibieron una asociación de 4 medicamentos incluyendo el etambutol. A los 18 pacientes restantes se administró la asociación HRE. La respuesta al tratamiento fue buena en 13 pacientes (42%) y ausente o tardía en 18 pacientes (58%). El fracaso del tratamiento se debe en parte a la aparición creciente en nuestra región de cepas de
Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistentes a los medicamentos antituberculosos de primera línea. Dadas estas observaciones, así como la necesidad de una mejor respuesta a la terapia que la obtenida habitualmente en los casos con tuberculosis y SIDA y en consideración de los efectos epidemiológicos, se debería definir regímenes terapéuticos y profilácticos alternativos.

N2  - In this paper the term Deaf is used of a group of people who use sign language, who come into contact with the criminal justice system in the UK, and for whom mental health needs are associated with their offending behaviour. It critically reviews the existing literature regarding evidence of the prevalence and characteristics of this group drawing on a range of contexts: prisons, high-security services, specialist mental health services, and the police and courts. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between deafness, sign language use, mental disorder and unfitness to plead. Also, consideration is given to the extent to which a limited range of linguistically appropriate disposals for Deaf mentally disordered offenders may account for their twelve-times-higher prevalence in the high-security population than in the general population. Finally, the clinical characteristics of this population are discussed in relation to a range of psycho-social consequences of Deafness and sign language use in the UK today.

N2  - Eight issues in the care of prisoners in the ED have been examined. Close to one-half million persons are incarcerated at any time in the United States, and the numbers can be expected to increase.
When seeing prisoners in the ED, the physician must keep in mind two facts: 1) prisoners have a right to medical care; and 2) incarceration demands that certain considerations be made regarding the correctional environment when evaluating, treating and, most importantly, discharging a prisoner back to the cell.

N2  - Evaluating drug abuse treatment within a correctional framework presents unique issues and challenges. Given their respective emphases on rehabilitation and incapacitation, treatment and corrections approaches to incarcerated drug abusers often differ in methods aimed at reducing deviant behavior. Although this results in problems in planning integrative drug abuse intervention strategies, the two approaches are not always incompatible. Corrections can help identify those individuals in need of treatment, and for some of these, treatment can lessen the need for incapacitation. Understandably, gaining a drug-abusing offender's cooperation in monitoring routines and engendering trust in the confidentiality of treatment conducted in criminal justice systems settings, while still ensuring public safety, are not easy tasks. Nevertheless, there are decided advantages, in terms of compliance and retention, to the increased surveillance exercised by the criminal justice system in community-based treatment efforts. In these efforts, therapy coupled with urine monitoring appears particularly promising. Along with the presentation of descriptive and preliminary outcome information, this report provides a discussion of treatment/corrections issues within the framework of an ongoing treatment evaluation study involving drug-abusing parolees in Baltimore City.

N2  - In this study we undertook field-testing of a combination of two brief screening tools that identify women prisoners who may suffer major mental illness or present a risk of self-harm. Their ease of administration, tolerability, face validity and overall impact on the existing visiting psychiatric service were examined. The Referral Decision Scale and the Suicide Checklist were administered to 150 receptions at Arohata Women's Prison, New Zealand, over a 1-year period. Results indicate high levels of psychiatric morbidity similar to that found in previous studies and suggest more will be identified and receive intervention compared with the existing arrangements. Approximately one-third of the sample had been known to mental health services and a similar proportion had attempted suicide. The unique population ethnicity raises questions for the screening process and resource allocation. Previously proposed changes to the recommended cut-off scores are supported. High endorsement rates on the depressive sub-scale and self-reference stem require further investigation. This intervention appears to be well tolerated and quick to administer. Our experience suggests that the tool is sufficiently sensitive with an acceptable number of false negatives for a screening instrument.

N2  - While the War for Independence from Britain looms large in its impact on late eighteenth-century American politics and culture, older forces, including the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening, inspired a great deal of social transformation as well. The Enlightenment was characterized as “the age of reason,” in which human progress would be measured through advances in science, medicine, technology, culture, and politics. Enlightenment writers from Cesare Beccaria to Montesquieu produced progressive theories of criminal justice that rejected the legacy of European brutality and aimed to put logic, predictability, and fairness at the heart of punishment.

N2  - The present study utilizes multiple regression analysis to identify relationships between 13 sociodemographic characteristics and the frequency of drinking in seven different types of drinking places among convicted drunken drivers (
N = 6,183). The results indicate that different sociodemographic subgroups of drinking drivers tend to drink in different types of places. Younger respondents were more likely than older respondents to report frequent drinking in away-from-home locations such as friends' homes, bars, parties, cars, and parking lots. The males were more likely than the females to report frequent drinking in cars and parking lots, and unmarried respondents drink at parties and in bars more frequently than married respondents. Education, race, and the frequency of worship service attendance are also found to be important predictors of drinking locations.

N2  - Tattoos of all kinds have been found to be associated with marginal groups, antisocial behaviours and mental health problems. Little is known, however, about the subgroup with prominent tattoos on areas of the body, such as the face, which are clearly visible to others. This paper investigates associations between visible tattoos and mental disorder, substance misuse and criminality in a large group of adult male prisoners. Childhood adversity, drug and alcohol misuse, self-harm, violent behaviour and previous imprisonment were all found to be significantly associated with the presence of visible tattoos in this population. Whilst prior contact with psychiatric services was also significantly more common, no relationship existed between visible tattoos and lifetime DSM-IV mental disorder per se. Personality disorder was not found to be more prevalent in the visibly tattooed group, but a statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between visible tattoos and schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders. Therefore, we recommend caution when screening such individuals for mental disorder. At first glance the history may suggest personality disorder, but further enquiry should be undertaken to look for signs and symptoms indicating a functional psychotic disorder.

N2  - A communication system is provided for use of cinder block to re-radiate an RF signal. The system overcomes limitations of prior art techniques which attempt to work either through/around the cinder block or concrete as RF obstruction. In contrast, the present invention uses cinder block as re-radiator for RF signal. Although cinder block or concrete has been used here, it is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the same technique can be used with other building materials, The system is particularly useful when deployed in a MAS system or a jamming system in a prison environment. In this type of deployment, the cinder block or concrete can either be used to re-radiate TX signals from a BTS system or to re-radiate jamming signals from a jammer. The cinder block or concrete can also be used with an associated main receive antenna to improve signal reception.
La présente invention concerne un système de communication utilisant une brique de mâchefer afin de répéter le rayonnement d'un signal RF. Le système surmonte les limitations des techniques de l'art antérieur qui tentent de fonctionner à travers/autour de la brique de mâchefer ou du béton en tant qu'obstruction de RF. Contrairement à l'état de la technique, la présente invention utilise la brique de mâchefer en tant qu'élément de répétition du rayonnement du signal RF. Bien que l'on ait utilisé ici une brique de mâchefer ou du béton, l'homme du métier comprendra que la même technique peut être utilisée avec d'autres matériaux de construction. Le système est particulièrement utile lorsqu'il est déployé dans un système MAS ou dans un système de brouillage dans un environnement carcéral. Dans ce type de déploiement, la brique de mâchefer ou le béton peuvent être utilisés pour exécuter la répétition du rayonnement de signaux TX à partir d'un système BTS, ou exécuter la répétition du rayonnement de signaux de brouillage à partir d'un brouilleur. La brique de mâchefer ou le béton peuvent également être utilisés avec une antenne de réception principale associée pour améliorer la réception du signal.

N2  - The offender who feigns a psychotic disorder represents a significant challenge in forensic practice with serious implications if misdiag-nosis or mismanagement occur. The present study focuses on gathering empirical data regarding the presentation of offenders who fake auditory hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms. The objective is to provide clinically useful indicators derived from examining the patterns of characteristics reported by simulating and genuine patients, which may aid the clinician needing to distinguish authentic from feigned presentations of auditory hallucinations.

N2  - OBJECTIVES To identify self-reported characteristics of past sexual assaults perpetrated by incarcerated juveniles and to determine potential precursors of this behavior. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS Participants completed an anonymous written questionnaire regarding their experiences of sexual abuse and/or assault as both a victim and a perpetrator. The questionnaire was incorporated into an existing annual survey of gang-related behaviors. RESULTS A total of 805 adolescents (707 boys, 91 girls, and 7 gender-not-designated) participated. Of these teens, 79 males (11% of the males), 9 females (10% of the females), and 5 (71%) gender-not-designated said they had forced sex on someone (165 did not answer the question). Twenty-eight males (30% of the male perpetrators) and 4 females (44% of the female perpetrators) were both victims and perpetrators. Drugs and/or alcohol were frequently used by both the assailant (58% of the males and 55% of the females) and the victim (56% for the males and 66% for the females). The attributes of adolescent boys at highest risk of becoming perpetrators were all related to violence, including exposure to parents who were violent in the home (adjusted odds ratio, 2.68), being a victim of physical or sexual assault (adjusted odds ratio, 2.83), having parents who encouraged gang membership (adjusted odds ratio, 3.58), and knowing a perpetrator of sexual violence (adjusted odds ratio, 3.83). CONCLUSIONS Adolescent boys and girls were both victims and perpetrators of sexual assault. Programs that identify and target violence in young children's lives, particularly intrafamilial violence, may reduce the risk of teenagers becoming perpetrators of sexual violence. Anticipatory guidance during teen years, regarding risk and avoidance of sexual exploitation, may be helpful in reducing the chances of sexual assaults.-->

N2  - CONTEXT Despite the wide availability of guns in the United States, not all delinquent adolescents own guns and not all adolescent gun owners carry them at all times. Research about the factors that prevent high-risk youth from acquiring and carrying guns is limited. OBJECTIVE To determine, from the perspective of incarcerated adolescent males, factors that prevent acquiring or carrying guns, either on a temporary or permanent basis. DESIGN AND SETTING In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted with randomly selected incarcerated adolescent males at a residential juvenile justice facility from January to May 1998. Transcribed interviews were examined for recurrent themes. PARTICIPANTS Forty-five incarcerated adolescent males. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Reported factors limiting gun acquisition and carrying. RESULTS Seventy-one percent of the sample had either owned or carried a gun out of their home. We identified 6 recurring themes that, at least on occasion, prevented or delayed delinquent youth from acquiring or carrying guns. The most commonly cited factors were fear of being arrested and incarcerated and lack of perceived need for a gun. Other themes included not wanting to hurt oneself or others, respect for the opinions of others, inability to find a source for a desired gun, and lack of money to acquire a desired gun. CONCLUSIONS We identified 6 factors that limited gun acquisition and carrying among a sample of incarcerated male adolescents. Knowledge of these factors should inform intervention efforts to reduce youth gun acquisition and carrying.Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2001;155:335-341-->

N2  - The factor structure of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale‐Revised (WAIS‐R) for a large sample of incarcerated individuals (N = 234) was investigated. A principal components analysis followed by Varimax rotation identified the familiar Perceptual Organization and Verbal Comprehension factors. Coefficients of congruence between the current factors and those of the WAIS‐R standardization sample indicate a high degree of correspondence. Thus, empirical support was provided for interpretation of WAIS‐R Performance and Verbal IQs in this population.

N2  - The current study reviews the personal characteristics of 32 consecutive admissions to a secure custody centre in one southwest Ontario jurisdiction under the Young Offenders Act. Results indicated that there was considerable variability amongst the group regarding court history and the seriousness of the charge on which committal was made. Background history data suggested that the problems of youths committed to secure custody reflect considerable difficulties within families and school. The discussion questions whether the youths in this group are better served through the dispositions emphasizing custody-deterrence or rehabilitation-treatment. Implications for young offender policy are also presented.

N2  - There is a substantial literature that focuses upon the experience and expression of anger, and the effect that this might have upon an individual's general health. However, remarkably little is known about the relationship between anger and general health with young offenders. Using self-report measurements, the relationship between anger and general health is explored in a population of young offenders. The study showed that a series of significant relationships existed between young offenders' responses on measures of anger and their general health. The implication of these findings for both staff training and the development of anger management programmes is explored as well as methodological limitations.

N2  - This study aims to determine the prevalence of psychological problems in a sample of imprisoned male adolescents in Greece, to examine their clinical, demographic and family characteristics and to determine whether adolescents belonging to ethnic minority groups are over-represented in prison. In the study 55 young offenders in two prisons completed the Youth Self-Report and were compared with 154 community control subjects. There was a high incidence of psychological disorder in imprisoned adolescents when compared with the community sample. Illicit drugs were used by 70% of these adolescents. They reported high rates of family and social adversity. Persistent and more serious offending was related to higher rates of psychosocial and family adversity. Ethnic minorities and immigrants were over-represented in the sample. Immigrants reported fewer psychological problems and less disturbed family and social background. Policy-makers need to take into account the mental health needs and cultural background of the adolescents in custody and their families. Consideration needs to be given to the provision of specialist services such as training of social workers and prison staff in identifying psychiatric problems, prison psychiatry and court liaison schemes. Courts should also adopt less punitive approaches when considering disposal of adolescents.

N2  - Recent government policy has focused on the reform of prison healthcare services, with a view to achieving equivalence of care with the NHS. A proposed methodology of prison healthcare needs assessment has been developed in the form of a 'toolkit' to be used in all UK prisons for the purpose of service planning. This toolkit is described, along with systematic needs assessment instruments used in the NHS. Recommendations are made for future healthcare needs assessments of the prison population.

N2  - Background:
Telemedicine has been increasingly used in some areas to provide consultation for isolated populations that might otherwise have difficulty accessing specialty care. Little information exists on what types of patients or diseases are being seen in dermatology telemedicine consultation services.
Objective:
To review our consultations done over a regional telemedicine network with an emphasis on looking at what type of patient, cutaneous diseases, and diagnostic or therapeutic recommendations were made.
Results:
Between August 1992 and December 1997, 796 teleconsultations were done. The most common diagnoses made were eczemas, follicular based diseases, skin infections, and skin tumours. Steroids were the most commonly recommended therapy, along with antibiotics, antihistamines, and antifungal therapy. Diagnostic recommendations commonly made were a skin biopsy and potassium hydroxide preparation.
Conclusion:
Common skin problems were seen by our dermatology teleconsultation service. A significant number of diagnostic biopsies and potassium hydroxide preparations were recommended. The efficacy of telemedicine in the delivery of dermatologic care is reviewed.

N2  - This chapter examines how Black Lives Matter has assembled technologies of appearance, comprised of assemblages of co-presence, persistent looking and embodied protest. Digital co-presence allows a certain by-passing of physical and social constraint. Appearance invokes co-presence between physical and online spaces. Digital co-presence has sustained a persistent look at what white supremacy keeps out of sight, off stage and out of view. Co-presence, persistent looking and the articulation of Black and blackness came together in performed action as a set of technologies of appearance, especially after the murder of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, 2014. #BlackLivesMatter mobilized political bodies from vulnerable bodies that can be harmed and can die in order to sustain a movement. Black Lives Matter uses persistent looking to refuse to look away, creating a deliberate engagement with the loss of so many through reenactment.

The New Mexico Penitentiary riot of February 2, 1980, resulted In death for 33 Inmates at the hands of their fellow prisoners, and the hospitalization of 62 inmates for treatment of drug overdose or trauma. A case-control study of dead and hospitalized Inmates was conducted to determine risk factors for victimization. Twelve (12.5%) of the 96 inmates housed in the protective custody unit were killed, compared with an overall penitentiary death rate of 2.9% (p = 0.0003). These 12 Individuals were similar to the general inmate population with respect to age, race, years of education, crimes, time served, and prison rule infractions committed. In contrast, the 21 homicide victims housed In other areas were younger and had committed significantly greater numbers of rule infractions during Incarceration. Prisoners hospitalized for drug overdose, but not those hospitalized for traumatic injuries, could be differentiated from the remaining prison population by Increased convictions for homicide and higher prison infraction rates. inmates in protective custody were targeted selectively for death; other subgroups of victims of violence appear to share characteristics often associated with perpetrators of violence.

N2  - The validity of the Adolescent Problems Inventory (API), a measure of social competence in situations related to antisocial behavior in adolescence, was investigated in a sample of 60 incarcerated male juvenile delinquents. Criterion variables included historical and current behavioral indices of antisocial and disruptive behavior. Statistical analyses revealed no significant relationships in the expected direction between the API and the criteria in either the full sample of subjects or in the black or white subsamples. These results challenge the validity of the API within these populations. Recommendations for a more refined assessment of social skills in juvenile delinquents are made.

N2  - The British government has proposed a new Mental Health Act, which incorporates detention for 'dangerous severe personality disorder' (DSPD), but is nevertheless to be 'fully compatible' with the European Convention on the Human Rights Act. A very broad interpretation had indeed been given by the European Court to the key phrase 'persons of unsound mind', in the landmark case of Winterwerp . However, the importance of an individual's own interests as the basis for detention, rather than dangerousness, was emphasized in the less well-known case of Guzzardi . The government may need to redraft its proposals to meet the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998.

N2  - ABSTRACT
Objectives  To review systematically the evidence on opioid substitution treatment (OST) in prisons in reducing injecting‐related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviours.
Methods  Systematic review in accordance with guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Electronic databases were searched to identify studies of prison‐based opioid substitution treatment programmes that included assessment of effects of prison OST on injecting drug use, sharing of needles and syringes and HIV incidence. Published data were used to calculate risk ratios for outcomes of interest. Risk ratios were not pooled due to the low number of studies and differences in study designs.
Results  Five studies were included in the review. Poor follow‐up rates were reported in two studies, and representativeness of the sample was uncertain in the remaining three studies. Compared to inmates in control conditions, for treated inmates the risk of injecting drug use was reduced by 55–75% and risk of needle and syringe sharing was reduced by 47–73%. No study reported a direct effect of prison OST on HIV incidence.
Conclusions  There may be a role for OST in preventing HIV transmission in prisons, but methodologically rigorous research addressing this question specifically is required. OST should be implemented in prisons as part of comprehensive HIV prevention programmes that also provide condoms and sterile injecting and tattooing equipment.

N2  - Low total serum cholesterol (TC) concentrations have been found to be linked with violent and suicidal behavior among mentally ill patients and also in the general population. However, it has remained unclear if this correlation is non-linear, which would allow the determination of a cutoff TC level to differentiate violent or suicidal subjects from non-violent and non-suicidal subjects. We studied, in 397 Finnish forensic male patients, by using ROC analysis, the optimal cut-off point for TC level to differentiate between those who had been secluded because of acute acts, including violent and suicidal behaviors, and those who had not. According to ROC analysis, the observed cut-off points of the TC levels (5.3 mmol/l) for differentiating between those patients that had been secluded and those that were nonsecluded were below the mean TC levels of the Finnish general male population, and moderate sensitivities and specificities were achieved. The low (below 5.3 mmol/l) TC level seems to be a marker for an increased risk of violent and suicidal behavior among Finnish forensic male patients.

N2  - The abolition of corporal punishment didn't stop Matthew Hines from being beaten and pepper-sprayed as he begged correctional officers for his life, nor did the abolition of the death penalty prevent Ashley Smith from being videotaped as she took her own life after running the gauntlet of the psy-carceral system. [...]Indigenous programs and the permission to smudge and hold traditional medicines does little to erase the legacy of colonialism and the evolution of Canadian prisons into the new residential schools. Even the CCRA and the OCI haven't been able to prevent women - especially Indigenous women, the fastest-growing prison population - from being ignored in their pleas to access mental health resources or being denied the dignity of appropriate access to basic hygiene items like sanitary pads, as confirmed by a recent fact-finding trip to the Joliette women's prison by senators on a special committee investigating human rights in Canadian prisons. The recommendations relevant to this discussion include: eliminating the Accelerated Parole Review, which provided access to parole at the one-sixth point in an inmate's sentence for non-violent firsttime prisoners; sweeping changes to the criteria and eligibility periods for obtaining a pardon (now known as "record suspension"); eliminating onlocation culinary work and introducing "cook-chill" technology (resulting in reduced portions and lower food quality); and introducing a food-and-accommodation tax that would see prisoners' already-meagre wages of mere pennies per hour slashed by thirty percent to cover the costs of their punishment and telephone access (this was accompanied by the elimination of incentive payments, paid at a rate of $2.50 per hour, for productive labour performed by prisoners at CORCAN industries). Increase training for CSC institutional staff, as well as measures to promote greater accountability to ensure that staff are fulfilling their obligations to respect prisoners' human rights while assisting them in fulfilling their correctional plan objectives prior to their parole eligibility dates in order to facilitate their timely, safe reintegration, improving public safety outcomes, and reducing incarceration costs. 8.

N2  - Prison populations are at increased risk of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, but among female inmates information on such risks remains scarce, especially in developing countries. Between October 1992 and November 1993, 350 women incarcerated at a prison in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were prospectively evaluated for HIV and M. tuberculosis infection and disease. Among them, 87 (25%) were HIV seropositive, and 20 (5.7%) had tuberculosis (TB). During the incarceration period, the purified protein derivative test conversion rate was 29% for HIV-positive and 32% for HIV-negative women. However, the incidence of TB was 9.9 per 100 person-years for HIV-positive and 0.7 per 100 person-years of incarceration for HIV-negative women (p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis indicated that HIV infection (p < 0.0001) and incarceration time <12 months (p < 0.05) were each associated with TB. These findings indicate that new transmissions of M. tuberculosis infection are common among female inmates and that HIV-infected women are more likely to acquire active disease during the first 12 months of incarceration. Because of their role in childbearing and care, female inmates are an important potential source of transmission of M. tuberculosis, and new strategies to control the spread of TB in prisons need to be developed.

N2  - This chapter begins with some general considerations about the emergence of a visual democracy and the space occupied by staged imagery of killing and torture (SIKT) within a context of greater popular access to the visual. It focuses on SIKT as a form of semiotic warfare, involving the deployment of strategically chosen signs and viewing scripts. The chapter discusses the ethical aspects of seeing atrocity images, leading, to a consideration of curating as a potentially helpful concept with which to make sense of seeing as a political activity that is increasingly performed online by users deploying the creative affordances of the Internet. SIKT is very much like a piece of performance art, turning torture and execution into spectacle. The camera is not there to simply record and witness war in the style of traditional war photography: a reality is created mainly so that it can be captured by the camera, turning the latter into an implement of torture.

N2  - At a murder trial the prosecution sought leave of the court to call the head of medical services of the prison where the defendant had been remanded in custody. It was the defendant's evidence that he had not been present at the scene of the killing. The head of medical services, first in his report and later in a statement, said, however, that the defendant had told him that he had in fact been present. The court confirmed that no privilege attached to the communication between doctor and patient, the evidence was not obtained unfairly and it was not unfair to admit the statement in evidence. The trial judge approved the practice by medical practitioners of informing prisoners at the earliest opportunity that anything they say to a doctor in prison might be used in evidence, and went on to say that it is preferable to note the practice or its implementation on the prisoner's medical record. This case is used to discuss the case law that has established the rules concerning confidentiality in relation to medical consultations, and to suggest practical measures to avoid the difficulties inherent in the disclosure in legal proceedings of information supplied to medical practitioners who have been asked to report on a patient's condition.

The patient was treated in a maximum security facility. The murder is interpreted psychodynamically as an identification with the aggressor, the patient''s mother. It is also understood as a pathetic appeal for help.

N2  - This article focuses on the provisions of Home Office circulars 52/1997 and 54/1997. Both circulars were published in conjunction with the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 last year and aim to provide guidance and assistance to the relevant professionals as to the implementation of the provisions, which have been introduced by the Act. Principally, the Act introduced new and controversial mandatory custodial sentences and a specific new disposal power in relation to mentally disordered offenders. This article outlines the main provisions of both circulars and attempts to assess the likely impact and utility of the guidance that has been provided. In particular, attention is focused upon the provisions in relation to the new custodial sentences and specific emphasis is placed upon their likely impact in relation to the disposal of mentally disordered offenders. It is submitted that the guidance contained in the circulars adds very little to the interpretation of the provisions in the Act. Consequently, it is maintained that, in the absence of detailed and specific guidance, much emphasis will be placed upon the medical profession to assist the court in determining the appropriate disposal in relation to mentally disordered offenders.

N2  - An individual needs only to have his or her name on the electoral register to be eligible to vote in this country. For the majority of people appearance on this document is determined solely on place of residence. Prior to 1983 individuals with mental disorder were excluded from voting altogether. Curious anomalies in the law continue to prevent certain groups from exercising this right. Mental health care provision has changed since the introduction of the law, which is now outdated and in need of urgent reform.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the significance of indeterminate HIV test results in the prison setting. No specific information or guidelines are currently available to direct counseling of incarcerated persons with an indeterminate HIV test. A medical chart review was conducted on all incarcerated inmates at the Rhode Island State Prison who received indeterminate HIV test results between the inception of mandatory testing in 1990 and October 1996. Thirty-five inmates had an indeterminate HIV Western blot (WB) result, and 31 had follow-up HIV testing. Twenty-three of 31 (74%) of the prisoners with follow-up HIV tests seroconverted (95% confidence interval, 55%-88%). Drug/alcohol use, including crack cocaine and injection drug use, was strongly associated with seroconversion (p < 0.01, odds ratio [OR] = 11.8, relative risk [RR] = 2.04). Injection drug use was also significantly associated with seroconversion (p = 0.03, OR = 9.3, RR = 1.56). This is the highest rate of seroconversion ever reported for persons with indeterminate WB test results. Indeterminate test results need to be interpreted differently in the prison setting than in the community. Prison inmates with indeterminate HIV serology should be counseled that in all likelihood they are HIV-infected, and confirmatory viral load testing should be conducted immediately.

N2  - Discusses a House of Lords decision which clarifies the grounds for discharge of patients with psychopathic disorder who appeal. Finds that there is a linking of the grounds for discharge with the criteria that must be satisfied before detention under a hospital order can be imposed by a court and that the decision clarifies further the term 'medical treatment'.

N2  - There is a critical need for the development of effective substance abuse and dependence treatment programs in prisons and jails. One aspect of treatment provision within this population that has received insufficient research attention is the inclusion of health promotion or wellness programs, including exercise and other health-related lifestyle modification training. Little is known about either the physiological or psychological consequences of such lifestyle modification programs among prisoners with substance use disorders. This study reports the effectiveness of an experimental wellness program included as part of a residential treatment unit in a federal correctional institute in the United States. A sample of 43 female offenders with a history of polysubstance abuse or dependence, who had volunteered to be part of a residential drug treatment program, were evaluated. Changes in health status and perceived psychological well-being between entry into the program and exit after maintaining participation for a minimum of 9 months were assessed. Pretest-posttest comparisons on a variety of physiological parameters indicated that significant improvements had occurred in the physical fitness of the group. Thematic analysis of qualitative self-reports by inmates exiting the program suggested that participants had also experienced significant enhancements in a number of areas pertaining to psychological well-being, including self-esteem, health awareness and concerns, healthy lifestyle adoption, and relapse prevention skills. These results suggest that including health promotion training in drug treatment programs for incarcerated offenders may have beneficial results.

N2  - Psychiatrists have a number of 'gaoler roles': that is, they are involved in the detention and compulsory treatment of patients for the protection of others rather than for the good of the patient. Psychiatrists often feel uneasy about these roles, and may even deny that they exercise them. In principle-an argument based on human rights theory-it can be justifiable for the state to 'gaol' in appropriate cases. One line of argument contends that, none the less, this should not be the job of doctors. This argument is rejected in principle. Moreover, in practice psychiatrists will inevitably take other people's interests into account whether consciously or not, and political reality dictates that psychiatrists cannot escape their gaoler function.

N2  - This case-study is concerned with the aftermath of the Blom-Cooper Inquiry (1992) into Ashworth, a Special Hospital. A metaphoric approach is applied for analysing the changes adopted. The textual authority of the report is first discussed. The report sponsors the metaphor of purification and other linked concepts attached to sacredness: 'sacrifice', 'epistle', 'pilgrimage' and 'vision'. The semiotic rhetoric of purification attached to 'culture', 'therapy' and 'leadership' is also noted. That the latter have been left analytically unrefined in the report enables flexibility to be read into their operationalization by others within the organization. Finally, the signposting role of the metaphor of purification is noted; organizational mundaneness is primarily untouched by it.

N2  - Administered a verbal dichotic listening (divided attention) task to 146 male prison inmates (mean age 30 yrs) and 159 male noncriminals (mean age 27.5 yrs). The inmates were divided into psychopathic (P), nonpsychopathic (NP), and mixed (M) groups on the basis of a psychopathy checklist and the DSM-III criteria for antisocial personality disorder. Group P exhibited a significantly smaller right-ear advantage (less lateralized performance) than did either Group NP or the noncriminals. When the task was administered to 48 inmates under instructions to focus attention on 1 ear at a time, the performance of Group P was again less lateralized than was that of Group NP. The possibility that language processes are not strongly lateralized in psychopaths and that psychopaths are characterized by asymmetric low left-hemisphere arousal is discussed. (37 ref)

N2  - This article reviews trends in self-reported HIV risk behaviors across serial samples of injection drug-using (IDU) arrestees interviewed in Los Angeles. Between 1987 and 1995, a gradual decrease occurred in the percentage who share needles. However, measured over a past-year recall period, the prevalence of needle sharing remained high until 1994 to 1995, when it abruptly declined. Needle sharing with strangers and needle sharing at shooting galleries declined gradually throughout the study period. Among IDUs who shared needles, bleach use increased rapidly until 1991 but leveled off thereafter. No change occurred in number of sex partners, but condom use gradually increased among IDUs with 2 or more partners. Concurrent change in local needle exchange policy and practice may explain the abrupt decline in past-year needle sharing. New strategies may be needed to promote further increases in bleach use and condom use.

N2  - In reviewing Foucault on the asylum, the clinic, and the prison as institutional articulations of power and knowledge relations, Douglas Crimp
suggests that there ‘is another such institution of confi nement ripe for analysis in Foucault’s terms – the museum – and another discipline – art history’
(Crimp, 1985: 45). Crimp is no doubt right, although the terms of his
proposal are misleadingly restrictive. For the emergence of the art museum
was closely related to that of a wider range of institutions – history and
natural science museums, dioramas and panoramas, national and, later,
international exhibitions, arcades and department stores – which served
as linked sites for the development and circulation of new disciplines (history, biology, art history, anthropology) and their discursive formations
(the past, evolution, aesthetics, man) as well as for the development of new
technologies of vision. Furthermore, while these comprised an intersecting
set of institutional and disciplinary relations which might be productively
analysed as particular articulations of power and knowledge, the suggestion that they should be construed as institutions of confi nement is curious.
It seems to imply that works of art had previously wandered through the
streets of Europe like the Ships of Fools in Foucault’s Madness and Civilisation ; or that geological and natural history specimens had been displayed
before the world, like the condemned on the scaffold, rather than being
withheld from public gaze, secreted in the studiolo of princes, or made
accessible only to the limited gaze of high society in the cabinets des curieux
of the aristocracy ( Figure 1.1 ). Museums may have enclosed objects within
walls, but the nineteenth century saw their doors opened to the general
public – witnesses whose presence was just as essential to a display of power
as had been that of the people before the spectacle of punishment in the
eighteenth century.

N2  - Foregrounding a relation to the simulacrum and its experience of repetition "as our own existential possibilities" (p. 5), [Scott Durham] provides a lucid rehearsal of two prominent versions of this key concept. The most familiar, exemplified by the Pop art of Warhol, is the "copy of a copy." Through Baudrillard and Jameson, Durham recounts the emergence of simulacrum as the ungrounded, serial repetition of the external appearance of a distant model, an image disengaged from the ideal or essence of its original. To this well-received conception, Durham introduces [Deleuze] and Foucault's use of the "powers of the false" in Nietzsche's conception of the Eternal Return. In highly accessible terms, Durham explains how in this version, focus shifts from the simulacrum's mere divergence from an origin, and is theorized instead as a "practice of simulation" to falsify and malign the truth and legitimacy of the model it repeats in an affirmative movement of becoming (p. 11). Carefully unpacking each interpretation, Durham insists that for the critic as well as the consumer of simulacra, it is not a matter of choosing one (as a category of texts) over the other (as a philosophy of repetition). Rather, he argues that "the simulacrum's 'true nature' is inseparable from the potential for variation and displacement that haunts it, and from the effects that we in appropriating and repeating it in our turn are apt to draw from its repetitions in our lives and thought" (p. 15). Placing Deleuze alongside Baudrillard, Durham re-establishes the simulacrum as at once displacing us in an image sphere of tangled narrative, and in its constitutive movement ("the displaced repetition of the figures of the dominant") as an immanent power "to create a new sensibility and form of life no longer legitimated by or grounded in the dominant truths" (p. 20). With clarity and precision, Durham elaborates his conception of simulation and repetition from the works of Klossowski, Magritte, Warhol, Ballard, Genet, and Ruiz. Theorizing the tension internal to its appearance, Durham traces the simulacrum's generative potential through its emergence, negotiation, and passage between the utopic and dystopic myths in Klossowski, the spectacle and spectator in Ballard, the gap between word and image, unspoken and unrepresented in Magritte, as well as the clash of authority and subversion, truth and fabulation, purity and perversion in Genet. For example, in the tableaux of Klossowski and Magritte, Durham positions the simulacrum as "a product of the reigning narratives of origin and legitimacy which is nonetheless turned against those narratives, in a movement that subverts their demonstrations of resemblance and undoes their effects of truth" (p. 49). He extols Warhol's serial ghosts and the impotent desires of Ballard's fetishists as elements resistant to simulation, "the blurred vestige left in place of the absent original, at once the forgotten presupposition and the unthinkable remainder of a posthumous spectacle withdrawing to an infinite distance from victim and viewer alike" (p. 57). Finally, in Genet's prison novels, Durham argues that the falsifying and truthful narratives of the images of criminals and judges "give expression to a "beyond" that is immanent to the carceral universe itself: to the potential forms of life that are unthinkable and unimaginable within that universe, but which nonetheless flash up in its interstices" (p. 131). In each textual analysis, Durham elucidates the mutual exclusion and reciprocal presupposition of the simulacrum, weaving a relation of difference and equivalence between the elements from which it emerges, in order to release from the simulacrum its immanent power to reterritorialize the humanity haunting the margins of its images.

N2  - Summary
There are many challenges in providing genitourinary medicine services in prison. A review of current service arrangements is overdue. Developing a national standard for sexual health in prison must be a priority. Clinical governance arrangements underpinned by better health informatics and reliable measures of outcomes are key in developing this strategy.

N2  - Are benzodiazepines so likely to be abused or to cause a paradoxical rage reaction that they should be barred from use in correctional facilities? A considerable body of literature has advised to this effect. Review of this literature, however, indicates that the admonishments against benzodiazepines are often ill-founded. When given under appropriate guidelines, these drugs may relieve anxiety and its symptoms and restore an individual's ability to work and to establish interpersonal relationships.

N2  - The morbidity and mortality of stab wounds is unknown since much of the data is unobtainable. Folsom Prison, a closed system with respect to population at risk and medical care, represents a unique situation where all stab wounds and subsequent care are accounted for.A retrospective review of stabbing incidents at Folsom Prison identified 751 wounds in 270 prisoners. Overall mortality was 3%. Thirty-five per cent of the victims were hospitalized. The overall chance of serious injury, defined as an assault victim requiring more than cleansing and suturing of his wounds, was 25%. The most common procedures were tube thoracostomy (performed 36 times) and celiotomy (performed 31 times). We believe that this is the first study of its kind involving a closed population to accurately assess the overall morbidity and mortality of stab wounds. The 3% mortality and the 25% requiring a procedure beyond suturing reflects the low injury potential long clinically suspected in stab wounds.

N2  - The use of penile tumescence to categorize and assess the treatment of sex offenders has gained increasing popularity. Recent publications have expanded the use of tumescence measures for the classification of rapists. The majority of studies in the past using mainly subjects seeking treatment or admitting to difficulties in controlling rape urges have shown the technology to be a valuable assest in classification. This investigation points out the limitations of using this technology in certain populations. The responses of incarcerated rapists and incarcerated nonrape offenders were compared. There were no significant differences between the responses of rapists and nonrapists. The rape index proposed by Abel et al. (1978) did not reliably classify incarcerated rapists. The limitations of penile tumescence assessment with certain populations are pointed out and possible reasons for the failure to discriminate in this investigation discussed.

N2  - Prisoners who maintain an internal locus of control adjust more effectively in prison and after release. A program to increase internal locus of control by improving problem-solving skills was evaluated using a pre/posttest experimental design with a three-month follow-up. One hundred sixty-eight prisoners were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Contrary to the underlying theory of treatment, and theory regarding the effects of incarceration, the prisoners were found to have an internal locus of control and adequate problem-solving skills. Thus, prisoners already possessed characteristics that treatment was implemented to facilitate. Plausible explanations are discussed. The findings have clear implications for future clinical work. The need for knowledge-building in this area is also discussed.

N2  - One hundred and fifty felony drug offenders diverted from prison to community-based, residential drug treatment alternative to prison program completed a comprehensive interview as part of a longitudinal study. Treatment completion predictors were sought examining intake data (demographics, family, social, employment, medical, psychological, criminal, sexual behavior, drug use and treatment histories). Logistic regression results found completers had more social conformity and close friends, and less need for employment counseling, felony drug convictions, drug dealing income, and unprotected sex than dropouts. Completers were also less likely to encounter recent problems with significant other, have a psychiatric history, experience gunshot or stabbing, and commenced heroin use at older ages than dropouts. However, completers reported higher alcohol use than counterparts. Further analyses explored subcategory models: “life choice” (substance use, criminal and sexual behavior), static (background and dispositional), and dynamic situational influences (employment, psychological state, recent and past encounters). Treatment implications considering findings are discussed.

N2  - The conditions experienced by people in custody in the UK have received considerable attention recently and there has been considerable debate concerning the standards of healthcare in British prisons. The Prison Health Care Service works under great pressure and difficulties and doctors have to deal with a large and ever-changing population, often with mental and physical disorders, who are frequently manipulative. This article highlights problems encountered in delivering diabetes care in prisons. Prisoners may self-induce diabetic ketoacidosis by refusing insulin injections, in order to be transferred to an outside hospital. On the other hand, prison staff may mis-interpret the symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes as 'acting up' by prisoners and inappropriate treatment can be given. If structured diabetes care is provided in prison, however, with close liaison between the Prison Staff and the local Diabetes Care Team, the basics of modern diabetes management can be provided. Good diabetic metabolic control can be achieved in the majority of patients, probably due to the rigid dietary regime, no alcohol and compliance with treatment. Imprisonment can ensure screening for diabetic complications and reassessment of treatment regimens. The British Diabetic Association guidelines for the provision of diabetes care in British prisons are outlined in this article.

Two had clonal chromosome abnormalities, i.e., 11q− and −11, and another had multiple nonclonal chromosome changes, including t(2p−;3q+),6q−,+12,14q+. These chromosome changes are also common in malignant lymphoma and suggest that the patients with PALS may be predisposed to develop malignant lymphoma.

N2  - Indiana Code 13-7-1-1 mandates that the state's solid waste disposal be reduced 50 percent by the year 2001. To surpass this goal and provide more jobs for inmates, the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC) is developing recycling and composting operations at institutions throughout the state. Another objective is to generate good will in local communities by giving them an opportunity to bring leaves and other yard trimmings to prison compost sites at no charge. As a result of legislation passed by the Indiana General Assembly, communities are prohibited from placing grass clippings and leaves in landfills. In February, 1997, Ed Cohn, DOC commissioner, introduced the recycling and composting strategy to the executive staff, division directors, facility superintendents and parole supervisors. He solicited the involvement of all department operations and staff members at each facility. The program and goals also were submitted to the Indiana Board of Correction. This coordinated effort will significantly reduce the quantities of materials sent to the landfill and the associated tipping fees.

N2  - Most food composting in the southeast occurs institutionally, reducing transportation and land costs, and supported by source separation. Food recycling has been fostered in some states by recycling initiatives. In North Carolina, food composting occurs at three state prisons, one of which uses vermiculture. Correctional facilities in Florida and South Carolina also compost food wastes. Universities in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia are significant composters, as are commercial facilities in North Carolina and Georgia. Municipal governments operate facilities in Florida and North Carolina.

N2  - Through the establishment of composting programs, New York State's Department of Correctional Services (DOCS) has been able to save $4.9 million in disposal costs as well as divert 34,000 tons of material in a 3-year period. Through humble beginnings and patient administrative support, the New York DOCS Waste Management initiative has grown to provide significant alternatives to landfill disposal for a major institutional generator. The combined efforts of university research, regulatory guidance and support, and staff dedication have yielded an example of what can be done to mitigate the cost of waste disposal and produce usable products that are environmentally benign.

N2  - In 1992, the Federal Correctional Institution (Petersburg, Virginia) was recycling some paper, wood, aluminum, and cardboard. The endeavor had the support of top management and staff, and sufficient recyclables and local markets were available. The US Environmental Protection Agency had provided technical assistance in the form of an on-site assessment of the facility in July 1992. The study showed the prison was spending about $65,000 each year for disposal, and that the solid waste stream could be reduced 50% to 75% by expanding the existing recycling program throughout the entire institution. The prison has implemented a composting program and expanded recyclables. The facility's toxic use reduction efforts have produced savings of approximately $12,000 per year. The prison has made significant purchases of high postconsumer recycled content materials for its printing operations.

N2  - The Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC) has begun a three-year food residuals composting demonstration project designed both as a model for potential start-up operations and a means of helping the state achieve its goal to recycle and reduce 40 percent of its waste stream by the year 2000. Inmates at four participating facilities are proving to be integral to the pilot, which is diverting organics from the landfill, saving money through reduced disposal costs and meeting the prison's goal of giving prisoners meaningful jobs that provide skills they might be able to use upon their release.

N2  - The New York State prison system has been a leader in developing recycling programs, with many prisons now operating their own materials recovery facilities (MRFs). The Wallkill Correctional Facility in Wallkill, New York--a minimum security prison with 600 inmates located in the lower Hudson Valley between Poughkeepsie and Newburgh--opened its MRF in 1990. The MRF is in a 10,000 square foot building behind the correctional facility and processes recyclables from 16 correctional facilities, as well as seven local business, four schools and six municipalities. It processed 544 tons of recyclables in 1996. The MRF accepts styrofoam, steel and aluminum cans, clear and colored #1 plastic, and paper including newspaper, third class mail, office and computer paper. Glass is not accepted for security reasons.

N2  - While on the one hand, this is the state's way of giving us quite a favorable rating (five stars, we are actually a threat), we who strive to live lives unmanaged by institutional and state power may find ourselves caught up in months or years long legal processes, which can be emotionally, mentally, financially, and logistically taxing for us as individuals and for our collectives, campaigns, and movement communities as a whole. Even when these processes don't end in long sentences (and sometimes they do), the state (and the life destroying interests they serve) uses the threat of such punishments, as well as the kafka esque nature of the carcéral system to intimidate and distract us, to defuse our resources, to divide us, and to slow our momentum. Anarchist collectives could be like, Let's fuck up the state and now we actually have money to pay for our bail. If you're coming to the frontlines the least you should do is find out the basics of the legal system, what happens if you're held over night, if you're held without bail, and these are things that the people planning the action should be able to talk over with you.
