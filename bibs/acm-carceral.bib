abstract = {This systematic literature review synthesizes published sources from the ASIS&amp;T Digital Library and the ACM Digital Library to develop a definition of the carceral state and to show how the term has been used in contemporary technology‐focused research. The carceral state concept has been adopted and applied widely in multiple areas of social scientific research to refer to the formal institutions of the criminal justice system proper and other social arrangements, ideologies, practices, and technologies that punish, surveil, and contain populations. Our review reveals a recent and increasing engagement with the carceral state in the collections surveyed. Encouraged by this increasing attention, this review is an attempt to introduce the carceral state as a guiding framework for tech‐society research and to consider implications for advancing responsibility, reflexivity, and care in the creation and evaluation of information systems, programs, and services.},

abstract = {In the late twentieth century, historic carceral tourism emerged as a widespread and popular pastime in the United States, with thousands of visitors flocking each year to decommissioned jails, detention centers, and state and federal prisons. "Prisons in the Popular Mind" analyzes historic carceral tourism at the Ohio State Reformatory, the West Virginia Penitentiary, the Missouri State Penitentiary, the Old Joliet Prison, the Old Idaho Penitentiary, the Historic Iowa State Penitentiary, the Old Montana Prison, and Eastern State Penitentiary, contributing to an emergent "prison public history" that scrutinizes relationships between history, incarceration, and the public imagination.Among those relationships is historic state prison museums' role in perpetuating the current carceral state—the extraordinary and unprecedented mass incarceration of Americans since the 1970s. How do historic state prison museums, their preservations, managements, and interpretations, contribute to public consciousness regarding contemporary incarceration? Historic state prison museums generally fail to engage or educate the public in critical and meaningful ways, especially about the carceral past and present. This dissertation argues that the majority of historic state prison museums contribute to a punitive public mentality that does not challenge the carceral state, reinforcing societal stereotypes regarding systems and practices of imprisonment, and posturing such patterns as historical with minimal impact on contemporary carceral issues. In so doing, this dissertation offers a scholarly intervention at the intersections of literature on dark tourism, museum studies, and carceral studies. It builds upon recent scholarly and public interest in the causes and consequences of the modern carceral state to situate historic prison museums as contributors to, and perpetuators of, Americans' uncritically romanticized conceptualizations of incarceration.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {This dissertation examines the shared politics of visuality that govern American domestic civilian and foreign military prisons. Though scholars have pointed to the interlocking systems of power that govern both spaces, this visuality renders them as fundamentally distinct in the public imagination. I argue that challenging and demystifying these power structures requires an interrogation of the visual regimes that help sustain them. This project builds on nascent scholarship by criminologists who have begun to theorize what has been termed "carceral visuality," or the intertwined hegemonic ideological and visual frameworks that discipline how citizens see and think about incarceration. I examine how carceral visuality operates in distinct, but interconnected ways across four prison sites and documentaries about them: Louisiana State Penitentiary (more commonly referred to as Angola), Attica Correctional Facility, Guant\'{a}namo Bay, and Abu Ghraib.Across each site, I trace how a set of dialectical tensions organize their visual fields: inside/outside, visible/invisible, presence/absence, and past/present. I argue that the formal capacities of documentary film offer unique potential to challenge the naturalized visions of the carceral state through their ability to exploit these tensions. The documentaries discussed in this dissertation operate as "carceral counter-visions," as they play with these tensions to fashion alternative ways for publics to see these prisons and to understand differently their relationship to the carceral state.Chapter one looks at the centrality of the inside/outside boundary in both the visuality of the Angola penitentiary and the public activism surrounding a trio of Black Panthers known as the Angola 3, who collectively spent over 100 years in solitary confinement. I argue that as Angola operates as both a prison and tourist site, it paradoxically positions the public as distanced spectators from the racialized bodies of the prison, even as visitors come into their proximity. I then analyze the ways in which this boundary runs through a group of documentaries about the Angola 3: In the Land of the Free…(Vadim Jean, 2010), Herman's House (Angad Singh Bhalla, 2012), and its related web documentary The Deeper They Bury Me (Bhalla and Ted Biggs, 2016). I argue that these films draw on, and play with, these same boundaries between inside/outside in order to disrupt the public's otherwise distanced relationship to the trio of men.Chapter two examines the visuality of the 1971 prisoner uprising at the Attica State Penitentiary. I explore how the large collection of visual and written archival materials from the rebellion are deployed across four documentaries that span roughly 30 years: Third World Newsreel's Teach Our Children (1972), Cinda Firestone's Attica (1974), Brad Lichtenstein's Ghosts of Attica (2001), and David Marshall and Christine Christopher's Criminal Injustice: Death and Politics at Attica (2013). The tension between past/present is central to the political work in these films. I contend that each exploits the gap between the archive and the embodied experience of those who survived the rebellion in order to disrupt the detached spectator's viewing position and to bring them into a closer proximate relationship with the social conditions that produced the rebellion in the first place.Chapters three and four shift to the military prisons Guant\'{a}namo Bay and Abu Ghraib. In chapter three, I discuss how Guant\'{a}namo Bay's visuality has been framed as inherently transparent and open. Through carefully curated public relations tours and imagery that depict it as a tourist site, the very exceptionality of the Guant\'{a}namo prison becomes normalized. I then analyze two documentaries about prisoners at Guant\'{a}namo that draw attention to the erasure of torture from the prison's visual field: Laura Poitras's The Oath (2012) and Patricio Henriquez and Luc C\^{o}t\'{e}'s 2010 documentary You Don't Like the Truth: Four Days in Guant\'{a}namo Bay. I argue that both documentaries are governed by an "aesthetic of failure" that self-reflexively highlights how little access the filmmakers, and the public, have to the prison. This failure productively calls attention to how the desire for full transparency into Guant\'{a}namo is fraught with a problematic set of assumptions and beliefs about the political power of transparency.In chapter four, I analyze two documentaries about the Abu Ghraib photographs and abuse scandal that rocked the American military: Rory Kennedy's Ghosts of Abu Ghraib (2007) and Errol Morris's Standard Operating Procedure (2008). I argue that the American military bureaucracy is an underexamined, yet significant force in the production of the visual field in which the detainee bodies appeared. While Ghosts of Abu Ghraib and Standard Operating Procedure have rarely been read alongside one another, I contend that both documentaries can be read as critiques of this military bureaucracy and that they both attempt to re-shape the American viewer's relationship to the photographs and to the bureaucracies that enabled the torture.},

publisher = {The University of Mississippi},
abstract = {This dissertation broadens the definition of confinement literature, a critical and developing subfield in African American literary studies. It argues that contemporary Black women writers are the early theorists of the complex and insidious reach of the U.S. prison-industrial complex. Through their probing representations of Black female characters' interactions with state-sanctioned social control and patriarchal violence, Gayl Jones, Alice Walker, Suzan-Lori Parks, and DaMaris B. Hill expand critical understandings of confinement and imprisonment. This dissertation contends that these writers' depictions of sexual and reproductive control as part of the developing carceral state reveal how confinement and imprisonment operate on intersecting oppressions of race and gender. As a purposefully interdisciplinary endeavor, "Carceral Matrix" merges African American literary studies, Black feminist theory, and critical prison studies to 1) document the rich but often overlooked literary history of Black women's responses to confinement, state surveillance, and violence and 2) theorize how Black women writers have used their respective genres to explore these methods of social control.},

year = {2020},
isbn = {9798664791815},
publisher = {The University of Wisconsin - Madison},
abstract = {In this dissertation, I argue that illicit, self-curated, and circulating images of black inmate life – representations in defiance of public notions of retributive punishment and "just suffering" – correlate to historic acts of black resistance and social critique that brought the rhetorical force of vernacular expression into and against dominant discursive narratives and forms.  Specifically, I present case studies of A&amp;E Network's Beyond Scared Straight, and an ex-inmate produced web- platform, Freshout: Life After the Penitentiary to argue the principles of contraband rhetoric, fugitivity, and the figuration of prison spaces as rival geographies. I draw on visual and material rhetoric studies and Black studies in order to track the influence of carcerality and inmate culture within the spheres of commerce, public discourse, and popular consciousness.  Circulation of self-narrativizing images of prisoner existence, knowledge, and experience have historical antecedents in earlier African-American representational reclamation efforts. Visual reclamation of black representation followed an established literary self- rehabilitation project in an historical lineage continuing into our networked present. Accordingly, this writing offers an interrogation of types and sources of racial images, prisoner produced and otherwise, in order to make sense of the power relationship between dominant culture produced racial images and the representational reclamation project of resistant Black incarcerated subjects. Furthermore, this project demonstrates the reach of carcerality as phenomena extending past social/political re-dress; inmate and prison culture has tangible influence in the public sphere as a touchstone for masculine identity and popular culture.},

publisher = {Washington University in St. Louis},
abstract = {By the 1830s, incarceration emerged as a two-pronged solution for racial control and economic expansion. Local and federal government built jails around the District of Columbia to detain "rowdy negro boys," men, and women, as a means to stymie their rapid movement and fuel a burgeoning domestic slave trade. People were jailed, fined, and often sold to the Deep South, providing a wellspring of capital for enslavers, justified through the lens of criminality. For the crime of petty theft, missing free papers, or in at least one case "using foul language," black people of the Washington region could find themselves jailed and subsequently sold to the highest bidder. This intersection between federal spending, public infrastructure and slavery will form the focus of this dissertation. It looks at slavery-capitalism's symbiotic development with the American carceral state - how racialized concepts of criminality became essential to the nineteenth century slave-making and freedom-making process in the United States.},

title = {Parenting Within the Hyperghetto Carceral Complex: Making Meaning of Youth Behavior Through Parental Identity},
year = {2020},
isbn = {9798672126883},
publisher = {The University of Chicago},
abstract = {Since the last decades of the 20th century, the defining life course experience of poor and undereducated African-American men has been involvement in carceral systems (Western 2006). This pattern begins early in the life course, with African-American adolescents being five times more likely than their white counterparts to be arrested or incarcerated (Sentencing Project 2017). Central to the discourse surrounding African-American youth participation in criminalized behaviors, are assumptions about their parents and families. This discourse often implicates parents as deficient in their parental role, identifies them as the cause of their children's undesirable outcomes, and effectively marginalizes these families from widely accepted middle-class standards. This dissertation explores what it means to be a stigmatized parent at the bottom of a social hierarchy when your child is disproportionately more likely to have interactions with carceral systems. More specifically, this study seeks to understand how such parents understand their parental role and made meaning of youth participation in criminalized behaviors within the context of narratives that blame parents for their children's undesirable outcomes. This study employed a qualitative methodology and collected data through semi-structured, community based, open-ended interviews with 36 parents of teenaged boys within the Englewood neighborhood in Chicago. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and interviews took place over the course of one year.  A grounded theory method of data analysis was used to identify and organize consistent themes among interview data. Parents stated that youth participate in criminalized behaviors despite the instruction provided by parents. Parents identified five primary causes for such youth behavior - youth agency, negatively influential peers, poverty, lack of community resources, and poor neighborhood role models. Parents also identified various behaviors and strategies they actively used to guide youth away from criminalized behaviors. Other findings indicate that participant parents shared an understanding of their parental role and identified specific obligations they must perform in order to maintain a positive role-based parent identity. Once established, this positive role-based identity is maintained, regardless of youth outcomes or behaviors because parents synthesize and draw meaning from their own experiences, community stressors, and the fulfillment of their own psychosocial needs. Based on these findings, the role of trauma, respect, and honor within families is considered. Further considerations include how parents navigate the undue burdens of structural inadequacies and dominant ideologies. I suggest that the production and consumption of narratives that center the negligent and ignorant poor urban parent provide a source of affirmation for other parental identities. As economic anxieties arise for all and the assurance of desired child outcomes becomes more uncertain for all parents across the socioeconomic spectrum, those who are already stigmatized become convenient scapegoats through which other groups can manage their own anxieties. But such scapegoating prevents identifying policies, programs, and opportunities to support all families as income inequality grows and stability becomes more elusive for the average U.S. household.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence reveals that the criminal justice system fails people in nearly every conceivable aspect of social, economic, and political life. Yet, its individualistic, punitive, and retributive models of "correction" continue to be practiced despite critical and abolitionist criminological scholarship that has repeatedly shown how it is not only individuals that need healing, but social structures, systems, and relationships that also require repair. With growing empirical interest in carceral reforms and reentry, few scholars have looked to criminalized people who have turned into active social-change makers. Thirty-two desisting formerly incarcerated participants varying by race and gender from across the US were interviewed for this project. Findings reveal that activism supplies the directly-impacted with dignity and robust forms of human (cultural), symbolic, and economic capital. Their transitions from carceral subjects to insurgent change-agents are marked by critical social connections, education, and action. Although desistance scholarship has illustrated the value of community engagement for reentering people, it has not specified precisely what the work entails - this project begins to address that problem. Participants differentiate peer and individual healing-work from activism. They describe how the work in their various capacities paradoxically interweave as crucial components of a transformative intervention, providing emancipatory healing for themselves, others, and society. In the experiences of shared oppression and collective action, carceral citizens are made legible as one distinct positionality within a carceral status system of oppression/privilege that intersects with race, class, and gender. Thus, granting clemency for some, and grave consequences for others. The findings highlight how racism, poverty, sexism, and other numerous social harms shaped their early life experiences and their collisions with the state. As activists, they aim to dismantle these imbalances in power. Reaching across lines of difference, as carceral citizens, they construct new identities through their mobilizations for self-determination. Implications of this study suggest that the unconsciousness, submissiveness, and low-expectations perpetuated by conformist and carceral treatment logics, are ineffective for any vision of safety or justice. Those models of recovery may be replaced with transformative interventionist approaches that spark consciousness, solidarity, and hope for healing. Formerly incarcerated activist stories in this project serve as evidence that returning people can survive, and even thrive, as they fight to bring about conditions of justice -- broadly.},

publisher = {Princeton University},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Carcerality in Transition: The Productive Relations of Reentry Governance in New Orleans is an ethnographic critique of contemporary carceral reform. Tracing the emergent infrastructure of prisoner reentry in New Orleans, Louisiana, this work interrogates the political economy and aspirational ethics of progressive city governance that reconfigure and are refracted through racializing techniques of punitive justice, capital investment and spatial regimes.While anthropologists and political theorists of governance have offered important critiques of the neoliberal city, they have not adequately attended to the processes of racialization that constitute the ethics of progressive governance. Drawing upon the scholarly repertoires of Black Studies, my dissertation intervenes upon conceptualizations of neoliberal urban governance by mobilizing theories and histories of racial capitalism and carceral geographies. Carcerality in Transition examines how the private/public infrastructures of reentry, from the experimental workforce development court to the nonprofits that provide professional training and transitional housing, impel certain social, material and ideological relations while foreclosing the potentials for others that could challenge neoliberal racial capitalism. Through this critique, I attend to the relational processes of racecraft and statecraft in the American City.This work explores the institutional and intimate socialites of formerly incarcerated men and their families, legal professionals, nonprofit operatives, city planners and municipal bureaucrats that differentially construct and participate within the emic landscape of the reentry space. I situate their life histories and experiences within the racialized histories of the city of New Orleans, from slavery and plantation economies to the more recent histories of urban divestment, post-Katrina devastation and dispossession. In studying what I call "reformist New Orleans," I argue that progressive innovations in carceral governance–characterized by a valorization of entrepreneurialism, design-thinking, data-driven best practices and technologies of care–ultimately defer racial justice while attempting to attend to racial inequality. Yet the vernacular practices of my interlocutors evade and exceed this framework to animate, even if only momentarily, a more radical distributive politics. Carcerality in Transition concludes by discussing the potentials for abolitionist futures.},

abstract = {Within HCI, ethnography has been embraced to grapple with the complexity of real-world settings and design technologies that operate effectively “in the wild.” However, some have criticized HCI’s engagement with ethnographic methods, arguing that ethnography has been circumscribed to an empirical, rather than analytical, enterprise whose perceived utility is limited to communicating uncomplicated facts to inform near-term design goals. We explore how “ethnographic lettering” might deepen HCI’s engagement with ethnography as a critical technical practice by allowing researchers to reframe technology users as interlocutors and the primary audience for the knowledge they produce. Ethnographic lettering can create avenues for more accountable and analytical reflections on the design of interactive systems. By experimenting with relational writing and research methods, we open the possibility for sociotechnical system design to be taken up not only as objects of study but as sites of critical inquiry and radical experimentation towards more just social formations.},

We report on a 12-week college-accredited web design class, taught virtually and synchronously, across 5 correctional facilities across the United States. The program brought together men and women from gender-segregated facilities into one classroom to learn fundamentals in HTML, CSS and Javascript, and create websites addressing social issues of their choosing. We conducted surveys with participating students, using dichotomous and open-ended questions, and performed thematic and quantitative analyses of their responses that suggest students’ increased self-efficacy. Our study discusses key design choices, needs, and recommendations for furthering computing curricula that foster self-efficacy and digital literacy in carceral settings.},

Third-party vendors control communication tools for most U.S. prisons and jails and offer surveillance capabilities beyond what individual facilities could realistically implement. Frequent communication with family improves mental health and post-carceral outcomes for incarcerated people, but does discomfort about surveillance affect how their relatives communicate with them? To explore this and the understanding, attitudes, and reactions to surveillance, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with participants who have incarcerated relatives. Among other findings, we learn that participants communicate despite privacy concerns that they felt helpless to address. We also observe inaccuracies in participants’ beliefs about surveillance practices. We discuss implications of inaccurate understandings of surveillance, misaligned incentives between end-users and vendors, how our findings enhance ongoing conversations about carceral justice, and recommendations for more privacy-sensitive communication tools.},

abstract = {Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential— just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.},

abstract = {As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants’ feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.},

abstract = {Educators and policymakers are increasingly trying to control youth access to technology in the classroom, while simultaneously working to deploy technology for purposes of surveillance and behavioral control. While many scholars have explored the implications of intensifying dataveillance and disciplinary practices deployed by teachers in K-12 schooling, few have investigated how students’ visions of technology deployment and use might align or diverge from those of designers and teachers. Using the resulting data from participatory design workshops and ethnographic research with students and staff in alternative hybrid schools, we explore students’ concepts of future technologies for the classroom and how these artifacts reflect student perceptions of safety and good behavior. Rather than simply accepting or resisting the role of technology in discipline and punishment as presented by technology creators, wherein disciplinary decisions are made by teachers using technology, students actively respond to these narratives to increase the objectivity and accuracy of punishment. The results of this work show how visions of future technology can sometimes reify new forms of power and other times respond to unmet student needs to exert control in the classroom.},

abstract = {This dissertation illuminates the lives of confined Black women by examining places in addition to carceral locales as arenas of confinement, including mental health asylums and domestic spaces. It seeks to explore how these women both defied and defined confinement through their interactions with public, social, and political entities of the period, as well as how they challenged Victorian ideas of race and femininity in Kentucky. Specifically, this project moves beyond a historical analysis of correctional institutions and Black womanhood to present three central arguments: first, that Black women negotiated the parameters their own confinement; next, that Black women's challenge of confinement also created the space for them to challenge trauma; and, finally, that confinement was not limited to carceral arenas. Other socially constructed environments, such as the home or religious institutions or ideologies, imposed social, political, and gendered restrictions on Black women's lives. Black women often engaged in acts of resistance that were not particularly liberating or in pursuit of freedom. If a woman grew tired and frustrated with the abuse in her home, did she view the possibility of incarceration as a temporary respite from family violence? Did Black women participate in the informal economy as a reprieve from the confinement of menial labor as domestic servants, or from financially limiting marital relations? This project explores such scenarios and argues that most women were aware that resistance to one form of confinement might lead to life in another confined space. I contend that these decisions were not made with freedom as a governing goal but to acquire temporary respite from their current, oppressive situation.},

While stakeholders emphasize ethical and responsible AI that is safe, anti-discriminatory, and “protects human dignity,” the centrality of anti-Blackness in the design, development, and deployment of AI systems coupled with race-evasive approaches to defining and advancing ethical, equitable, and ‘human-centered’ technologies have exacerbated racial oppression. We present three case studies of speculative technologies designed by Black youth in a college bridge, summer course that examine ethical and responsible AI in their everyday lives. From a bottom-up approach, we infringe upon this broader discourse to provide an initial grounding of responsible and ethical AI as well as discuss the criticality of Black, historically anchored, culturally-situated lenses to offer justice-oriented design principles that can guide the teaching, learning, and design of technology.},

abstract = {For the past three decades, the number of incarcerated women in Latin America has increased exponentially. This dissertation examines how women in Buenos Aires, Argentina, reimagine their lives during and after prison. Although an expansion of civil rights and the increased visibility of gendered violence characterized the last decade in Argentina, prison conditions for women have deteriorated. Through collaborative ethnography with YoNoFui, a collective of formerly incarcerated women, this research reveals institutional violence as gendered and as always imbricated in larger structural forces that scrutinize women and expand the social control of their lives. One of the dissertation's central insights is that collective feminist identities emerge and sustain their work through interdependence. I assert that this interdependence unfolds not only at the level of people finding ways to support each other's journeys but also at a broader scale, as collectives rely on other organizations and individuals to sustain their political work. I further argue that by emphasizing interdependence, contemporary feminist social movements in Argentina uphold self-determinacy as one of their central tenets. I draw from decolonial feminist theories of the state to make a case for the significance of women's cultural productions as they grapple with the effects of incarceration. My work draws from the term entre nosotras (among us), introduced by sociologist Raquel Guti\'{e}rrez Aguilar to stress how contemporary feminist political power in Latin America foregrounds the potential of renewed forms of interdependence that break away from social relationships of exploitation. Through poetry, photography, and activism, this multimodal ethnography informs the broader framework of the feminismos populares that have been brewing in Latin America in the past decade to identify the specific ways in which grassroots collectives like YoNoFui contest the oppression engendered by the carceral state. By tracing the lives of women moving through various stages and spaces of incarceration, this dissertation offers an ethnography of feminismos populares up against the carceral state.},

abstract = {This dissertation examines the centrality of the "Palestine problem" and Puerto Rico's "status question" to U.S. social movement networks and U.S. statecraft in the latter three decades of the twentieth century. Drawing on underutilized and, in some cases, unknown archives located throughout the United States, along with newspapers, government records, and oral histories, it traces the subtle but provocative connections activists, state agents, policymakers, and the media drew between Puerto Rico and Palestine. In asking how and why Palestine mattered for Puerto Rican radical politics, "Solidarities of Liberation" makes three arguments and interventions. First, I argue that, for the radicalization of Chicago's Puerto Rican community the transformation from community organizers to Marxist, revolutionary militants was fundamentally a story of Third World internationalism and global politics, in which the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was central. Despite the widely held recognition that Third World internationalism connected militant Puerto Rican youth to a network of radicalism beyond U.S. borders, the radicalizing influence of the question of Palestine on Puerto Rican activists remains unstudied. This project seeks to fulfill this gap and, in doing so, demonstrates a more expansive theorization and application of transnationalism in Latinx Studies: one that looks beyond migration and diaspora formations to instead uncover the diverse roles Puerto Rican and other Latinx activists have played in the building of Third World solidarities throughout the twentieth century. Second, Puerto Rican solidarities with Palestine emerged not only as global visions of liberation, but also through grounded modes of identification—in this case, the concurrent regimes of surveillance and political repression bearing down on Chicago's Puerto Rican and Arab American communities since the 1970s. While social movement historians have traditionally signaled the retreat from Vietnam and the repression and imprisonment of activists as the collapse of radical political organizing, Puerto Rican engagements with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict provide persuasive examples of the continued production of oppositional politics. Thirdly and lastly, I argue that these solidarities enabled the United States to further justify and consolidate its surveillance and policing efforts against Puerto Rican radicals by casting the Puerto Rican independence movement, like Palestinian resistance, as a terrorist—and therefore illegitimate—menace. In what was ultimately a battle over the United States' reputation as a global leader of democracy, comparisons between Puerto Rico and Palestine were coopted in service of imperial ambitions, demarcating the boundaries of legitimate political dissent. Whereas Puerto Rican radicals wedded their rejection of U.S. colonialism to the Palestinian struggle, those very solidarities became part of a larger set of justifications in the U.S. government's emerging fight against international terrorism. Yet Puerto Rico (and Puerto Ricans) has been absent from histories of the U.S. carceral and national security state, including histories of U.S. counterterrorism and counterinsurgent policing. Examining the state's impressive ability to weaponize Puerto Rican solidarities with Palestine provides an instructive story of how the Puerto Rican independence movement offered an important laboratory for international counterterrorism policies.  Thus, this dissertation joins new scholarly endeavors to chart the transnational dimensions of the U.S. carceral state, particularly its roots in colonization and imperial expansion.},

abstract = {This dissertation is a contribution to the depth and breadth of prison media history. I position prison media of the 1970s as key antecedents to the prison reality television of the 2000s and today. The purpose of this arrangement is to bring attention to an era of prison media that has been neglected in prison film histories and to highlight some commonalities between the 1970s and the mid 2000s +, as periods of potential carceral change, where incarceration is a topic of public discourse and critique.The first half of the dissertation is focused on media of the 1970s and adds to prison media scholarship in a number of ways. I argue that the success of Scared Straight! (1978) was made possible in part through the negotiation of racial tensions and its justification as a public service amid the televisual wasteland of the time. Having established the production of prison media for the public as a negotiation between prison administrators and media makers, I turn to a heretofore unexamined arena of prison media in chapter 2, instructional film, specifically The Correctional Officer film series. I argue that films aimed at instructing corrections officers are an important, untapped archive for unpacking how a 'professional' corrections officer should act and conceive of the work of corrections. I also established corrections officers as an important audience. The second half of the dissertation focuses on media produced after 2000, beginning with MSNBC's Lockup in chapter 3. I describe some of the ways that corrections has had a hand in particular Lockup productions and in doing so, argue for the importance of directing attention at the process of production as well as the depiction of corrections in prison reality television. I consider Lockup as a participant and product of neoliberal paternalism. I also offer narrative analyses of Lockup that are not directly related to mass incarceration, connecting the consumption of prison reality to anxieties around surveillance. Finally, chapter four steps 'outside the gates' to consider Love After Lockup  and I argue that Love After Lockup makes visible the reach of the carceral system while simultaneously questioning the rationality of caring for the incarcerated and formerly incarcerated. This project considers prison media history an important area of scholarly interest, one that requires more investigation if we are to understand the roots of mass incarceration.  I draw attention to the restrictions and means by which prison media are produced and to corrections as distinct from prison administrations, as a party with its own interests and power. I have pointed to instructional films and reality television as archives that demand additional attention and I conclude this dissertation with the suggestion that the question of care, rather than knowledge or 'realness,' is one to be grappled with if we are to move further along the path to conceptualizing a future where confinement is not the answer for a multitude of social ills.},

abstract = {From 1862 to 1865, the Confederate military and private citizens enslaved captured Black US soldiers by various means rather than treating them as legitimate combatants. Confederates saw Black soldiers as slaves, and treated Black POWs as reclaimed property and as a labor corps subject to the demands of military necessity under the laws of war. Black POWs were therefore relatively mobile and usually labored outside of prison walls, beyond the sight of US officials and White POWs. Black POWs could be (and were) sold, reclaimed by former enslavers, and used as laborers on military works, in hospitals, and in prisons. Black POWs' carceral experiences therefore centered upon their labor rather than their close confinement. Black POWs, navigated these diverse forms of captivity using survival strategies employed by American enslaved people over several generations, such as building personal relationships with one another and whites, using their particular skills while forced to labor, and escape. Their first person testimony, found in hundreds of military pensions, is vital to making sense of their survival and direct action during the war.},

abstract = {This exploratory study examines how carceral experiences extend beyond the boundaries of prison and impact the families of prisoners. For the purposes of this study, I interviewed twenty family members of prisoners who have extensive and in many cases ongoing familial experiences with the criminal justice system. The sample ranges from the spouses and children of prisoners and also includes unconventional immediate and extended family members. Respondents discuss key coping strategies for navigating the various conflicts that arise and female family members are unequally burdened with expectations for prisoner care and support compared to their male counterparts. However, these women and their families demonstrate remarkable resiliency in the face of oftentimes intersecting hardships. Experiences with addiction, poverty, and violence permeate the lives of this small sample of respondents, illuminating core challenges faced by people in marginalized communities, and highlighting the negative coping strategies of family members embroiled in the criminal justice system. Counter-intuitively, findings show that family members are often relieved when their relative becomes incarcerated, despite the temporary loss of the family member and the overwhelming evidence that incarceration is a highly stigmatizing punishment that severely restricts future opportunities. This exploratory study contributes to the field of counter-colonial criminology by including the experiences of indigenous family members of the incarcerated, offering valuable insights into an oft-neglected study population. The criminalization of indigeneity, poverty, and addiction act as forms of social control that contribute to the further marginalization of some of Hawai'i's most vulnerable communities.},

abstract = {This thesis examines convict transportation from the Madras Presidency to penal colonies across the Indian Ocean, particularly the Straits Settlements, between 1789 and 1860. It discusses the transportation of Indian convicts across the Indian Ocean as a carceral network, understanding it as a set of connections and interactions across the Indian Ocean, and alongside the concept of an 'Indian Ocean world'. The study begins by examining how transportation was understood by the colonial authorities in Madras and around the Indian Ocean, how transportation was imposed in Madras in practice and how transportation was experienced by those transported from Madras. One of its central aims is to examine the role of transportation in expanding East India Company (EIC) control in India and across the Indian Ocean. Through the East India Company's prisons and its coercive networks that extended across the Indian Ocean, convicts were orientated to prison discipline and rules. Their lives and experiences from the moment of their conviction to their transfer to zillah prisons and their journey from zillah prisons to Chingleput prison and finally to the penal colonies of the Straits Settlements was a long and continuous process of orientation to prison discipline and rules. Examining the transportation of convicts from the Madras Presidency also provides a new perspective on the global networks of migration during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries comprised of indentured labourers and migrants from South India. By focusing on the Madras Presidency, this research explores the continuities and divergences across the Indian Ocean world that began with convict transportation across the Indian Ocean in the late eighteenth century.},

This study draws on 40 qualitative interviews with community organizers involved in issues like immigration, reproductive justice, education, and policing. Our study takes metaphors given to us by community organizers (i.e., ammunition, teeth, receipts, compass) to reveal their data imaginaries. Particularly, their data imaginaries define what data means to them and what purpose it serves in their organizing. We find that community organizers also shared critiques of the ways data has been used to oppress minoritized groups. Given these findings, we conclude by encouraging future work that explores how community organizers experience and articulate epistemic burdens.},

abstract = {What counts as legitimate AI ethics labor, and consequently, what are the epistemic terms on which AI ethics claims are rendered legitimate? Based on 75 interviews with technologists including researchers, developers, open source contributors, and activists, this paper explores the various epistemic bases from which AI ethics is discussed and practiced. In the context of outside attacks on AI ethics as an impediment to “progress,” I show how some AI ethics practices have reached toward authority from automation and quantification, and achieved some legitimacy as a result, while those based on richly embodied and situated lived experience have not. This paper draws together the work of feminist Anthropology and Science and Technology Studies scholars Diana Forsythe and Lucy Suchman with the works of postcolonial feminist theorist Sara Ahmed and Black feminist theorist Kristie Dotson to examine the implications of dominant AI ethics practices. By entrenching the epistemic power of quantification, dominant AI ethics practices—employing Model Cards and similar interventions—risk legitimizing AI ethics as a project in equal and opposite measure to which they marginalize lived experience as a legitimate part of the same project. In response, I propose humble technical practices: quantified or technical practices which specifically seek to make their epistemic limits clear in order to flatten hierarchies of epistemic power.},

abstract = {The field of computer vision is now a multi-billion dollar enterprise, with its use in surveillance applications driving this large market share. In the last six years, computer vision researchers have started to discuss the risks and harms of some of these systems, mostly using the lens of fairness introduced in the machine learning literature to perform this analysis. While this lens is useful to uncover and mitigate a narrow segment of the harms that can be enacted through computer vision systems, it is only one of the toolkits that researchers have available to uncover and mitigate the harms of the systems they build.In this monograph, we discuss a wide range of risks and harms that can be enacted through the development and deployment of computer vision systems. We also discuss some existing technical approaches to mitigating these harms, as well as the shortcomings of these mitigation strategies. Then, we introduce computer vision researchers to harm mitigation strategies proposed by journalists, human rights activists, individuals harmed by computer vision systems, and researchers in disciplines ranging from sociology to physics. We conclude the monograph by listing principles that researchers can follow to build what we call community-rooted computer vision tools in the public interest, and give examples of such research directions. We hope that this monograph can serve as a starting point for researchers exploring the harms of current computer vision systems and attempting to steer the field into community-rooted work.},

abstract = {Prison and police abolition has become a major political philosophy in North American discourse following the 2020 George Floyd protests. The philosophy remains divisive, and North American abolitionists seeking to coalition-build, provide resources for vulnerable populations and garner public support continue to experience challenges. We explore current usage of digital tools among abolitionists and the potential of a digital mapping tool to address these challenges. We conduct an interview study with 15 abolitionist organizations to understand activists' perspectives on the value of digital tools for organizing and a content analysis of 25 existing digital tools that convey abolitionist ideas to the public. Our findings together reveal (1) opportunities for digital mapping and HCI to support abolitionist activism and grassroots activism more broadly and (2) the challenges of digitally and spatially representing a movement that is intentionally grassroots, clandestine, and often involves organizers working in disparate locations.},

abstract = {Scholars of criminology and sociolegal studies have long been concerned with the occurrence of anti-Black racism in the context of the criminal legal system, and special attention has been paid to developing policies meant to address empirical findings of anti-Black racism in the law. However, the policy development process is largely atheoretical when it comes to understanding the relationship among policy, anti-Blackness, and the criminal legal system. The purpose of this project is to develop a framework of legal change that theorizes the end of anti-Blackness in the law. To do this, I turn to Black studies theories of Black positionality as I develop the concept of structural abolitionism as one starting place for understanding a) anti-Blackness and subsequent anti-Black racism, and b) what it might mean to sever the relationship between anti-Blackness and the law. Upon the conceptual development of structural abolition, I mobilize the term in a historical context by examining the 1992 Los Angeles uprising and the post-uprising policymaking process. Specifically, I use a method of deconstructive content analysis to analyze archival documents of the Webster Commission, an entity formed to investigate the Los Angeles Police Department's response to the uprising and make recommendations to prevent future uprisings. Though the Commission made a variety of recommendations, their most prominent was that the LAPD transition to a model of community-oriented policing, a set of policing philosophies and practices primarily developed to address crime and disorder in Black communities while building trust between community members and the police. My analysis reveals that the Commissioners perceived Black communities as dysfunctional and were influenced, in part, by benevolent and paternalistic anti-Black logics as they sought to mobilize police officers as one resource to rehabilitate Black communities. As a result, I demonstrate how community-oriented policing not only failed at addressing the problems facing Black Angelenos, but grew the carceral state while perpetuating racial power. More broadly, by reading the Commission's archive and recommendations alongside theories of Black positionality, I explore the possibilities and limits of policy and other forms of redress for addressing the problem of anti-Blackness in the law.},

Teachers are at the front lines of this new form of image abuse and have a valuable perspective on threat models in this context. We interviewed 17 US teachers to understand their opinions and concerns about synthetic nonconsensual explicit imagery in schools. No teachers knew of it happening at their schools, but most expected it to be a growing issue. Teachers proposed many interventions, such as improving reporting mechanisms, focusing on consent in sex education, and updating technology policies. However, teachers disagreed about appropriate consequences for students who create such images. We unpack our findings relative to differing models of justice, sexual violence, and sociopolitical challenges within schools.},

We analyze three case studies of border technologies deployed at and beyond physical sites of border control: electronic device inspections, electronic location monitoring, and restricted transactions in financial technologies. Although a framework of DBA exists in the current paradigm of border studies, we argue that a close examination of the entanglements between borders and ICTs offers us key insights into how migrant bodies are subjected to racialized control at/by the border. Implications for HCI researchers include studying the experiences of those impacted by this assemblage and developing methods inspired by the legal field for studying these obscure systems.},

abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, videoconferencing platforms have become an essential part of our social, educational, and work lives. Furthermore, the United States continues to grapple with criminal justice reform, employing processes such as restorative justice to replace antiquated punitive approaches to justice with a focus on the multifaceted needs of communities. Essential to the delivery of restorative justice, restorative justice practitioners are community members trained in the process and approaches of restorative practice. Like everyone else, restorative justice practitioners have transitioned from historically in-person facilitation to online facilitation, integrating videoconferencing platforms into their justice-related work. Diverse communities within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have been examined in light of their digital transitions and the utilization of various digital tools, including videoconferencing platforms prompted by the pandemic. However, the distinctive perspective of restorative justice practitioners in adapting restorative approaches to an online format is unexplored. Therefore, our research examines how restorative practitioners use videoconferencing platforms for justice-related interventions. To do so, we conducted six semi-structured focus group interviews with 22 US-based restorative facilitators to learn about their experiences with online delivery of restorative justice. Our research revealed that restorative facilitators uphold restorative values in their online delivery by embracing the restorative facilitation process and fostering dialogue. Furthermore, we posit that the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community can acquire valuable insights from restorative practitioners on nurturing and sustaining intimacy and connection online.},

Unfortunately, they also seem to frequently present results that repeat or magnify biased treatment of racial and other vulnerable minorities. This paper proposes that at least some of the problems with AI’s treatment of minorities can be captured by the concept of epistemic injustice. To substantiate this claim, I argue that (1) pretrial detention and physiognomic AI systems commit testimonial injustice because their target variables reflect inaccurate and unjust proxies for what they claim to measure; (2) classification systems, such as facial recognition, commit hermeneutic injustice because their classification taxonomies, almost no matter how they are derived, reflect and perpetuate racial and other stereotypes; and (3) epistemic injustice better explains what is going wrong in these types of situations than does the more common focus on procedural (un)fairness.},

abstract = {Speech-to-text services aim to transcribe input audio as accurately as possible. They increasingly play a role in everyday life, for example in personal voice assistants or in customer-company interactions. We evaluate Open AI’s Whisper, a state-of-the-art automated speech recognition service outperforming industry competitors, as of 2023. While many of Whisper’s transcriptions were highly accurate, we find that roughly 1% of audio transcriptions contained entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio. We thematically analyze the Whisper-hallucinated content, finding that 38% of hallucinations include explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority. We then study why hallucinations occur by observing the disparities in hallucination rates between speakers with aphasia (who have a lowered ability to express themselves using speech and voice) and a control group. We find that hallucinations disproportionately occur for individuals who speak with longer shares of non-vocal durations—a common symptom of aphasia. We call on industry practitioners to ameliorate these language-model-based hallucinations in Whisper, and to raise awareness of potential biases amplified by hallucinations in downstream applications of speech-to-text models.},

abstract = {In Detroit, the largest Black-majority city in the United States, municipal authorities have deployed an array of surveillance technologies with the promise of containing crime and improving community safety. This article draws from a cross-sectional survey of over two thousand Detroit residents and multi-year community-based fieldwork in Detroit’s Eastside to examine local perceptions of policing surveillance technologies. Our survey reveals that respondents, notably those in more vulnerable positions, report higher perceived safety levels with policing surveillance cameras in their neighborhoods. However, when triangulating these results with insights from our fieldwork, we argue that these survey findings should not be taken as public support for surveillance. Alongside this seeming buy-in is a widely shared “better than nothing” imaginary among residents from impacted communities. “Better than nothing,” for the residents, is a pragmatic compromise and maneuver between being aware of the inherent flaws of surveillance technologies and settling for any available resource or hope. This notion of “better than nothing” unveils residents’ prolonged wait for digital justice and institutional accountability, which we show is where racialized infrastructural harm and exploitation are enacted along the temporal dimension. Our findings offer practical insights for counter-surveillance advocacy efforts.},

abstract = {The field of machine learning (ML) has long struggled with a principles-to-practice gap, whereby careful codes and commitments dissipate on their way to practical application. The present work bridges this gap through an applied affordance framework. ‘Affordances’ are how the features of a technology shape, but do not determine, the functions and effects of that technology. Here, I demonstrate the value of an affordance framework as applied to ML, considering ML systems through the prism of design studies. Specifically, I apply the mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances, which models the way technologies request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow technical and social outcomes. Illustrated through three case examples across work, policing, and housing justice, the mechanisms and conditions framework reveals the social nature of technical choices, clarifying how and for whom those choices manifest. This approach displaces vagaries and general claims with the particularities of systems in context, empowering critically minded practitioners while holding power—and the systems power relations produce—to account. More broadly, this work pairs the design studies tradition with the ML domain, setting a foundation for deliberate and considered (re)making of sociotechnical futures.},

abstract = {Early prediction of violent recidivism is one of the most essential tasks of the judiciary system. Being able to accurately forecast violent recidivism in offenders with heinous crime conviction can facilitate judiciary in taking decisions about sentencing, release, parole, and probation. Additionally, because violent offenders have a higher recidivism rate than nonviolent offenders, the development of intelligent risk assessment tools for early prediction of violent recidivism becomes highly essential. However, few such approaches exist, and their efficacy in the Indian context is often limited. As a result, in the present work, the aim is to develop an computational learning-based risk assessment tool for early prediction of violent recidivism among criminals with heinous crime convictions. In particular, we classify individual offenders as high, low, or moderate risk based on a variety of factors such as anger level (a psychological emotion), demography, and psycho-social factors. Effectiveness of different machine learning models viz.DTC, PNN, SVM, KNN, LDA have been simulated for recidivism risk assessment of offenders. The current findings demonstrate that violent recidivism at the individual level can be anticipated using a bagged tree ensemble classifier achieving maximum accuracy of 89%.},

The study of criminal justice is notable because it is a discipline in which applied and also controversial methods such as predictive policing and automated bail allotment have emerged in recent years (Brayne and Christin in Social Problems 68:608, 2020; Brayne (Predict and surveil: Data, discretion, and the future of policing. Oxford University Press, 2020). Many of these technologies rely on the combination of traditional criminological concepts with novel computational methods. I generate different measures of novelty, including the scientific journal and article content of references, to demonstrate that articles which use data-driven methods experience a particular advantage in impact measured by citation. I create estimations of article content using Top2Vec and compare novelty as measured by atypical combinations of references (Uzzi et al. in Science, 342(6157):468–472, 2013) and novelty as measured through sub-field integration (Moody in The Nonproliferation Review 3(3):92–97, 1996). To conclude, I discuss the larger implications that research in the era of “Big Data" has on the production of scientific knowledge, as well as how the discipline of criminal justice may or may not be disrupted by emerging machine learning-based technologies.},

publisher = {University of California, Berkeley},
abstract = {Despite a general pattern of decarceration occurring in US prison rates, an equivalent realignment has not developed around policing policy in cities across the US. This is despite the fact that in recent years, police departments throughout the country have faced intense public scrutiny for issues of misconduct and police violence. At the same time, a divide seems to be underway globally in which some cities and municipalities are adopting US-style, order-keeping policing policy, while others are reconsidering the conventional wisdom around the methods and goals involved in crime control. This dissertation investigates police practices aimed at "disorderly" activities on the margins of the law. It consists of a comparative ethnographic study of three restricted forms of entertainment in Oakland, California, Lima, Peru, and Stockholm, Sweden to investigate how different societies police activities deemed disorderly and how targeted groups respond to these interventions. Although prior penology scholarship has centered the discussion of punitive penal systems on larger political economic projects (e.g. neoliberal vs. social democratic) or solely at the site of the carceral state, this study shows how two mid-level factors—external, key government actors and internal police organizational logics—gives way to punitive practices described as dissonant disciplining. While dissonant disciplining in Oakland involved raids, surveillance, and racial profiling practices, in Lima, incosistent organizational logics made dissonant disciplining largely informal, consisting primarily of intimidation and physical violence handed out on the street. Repressive practices in these two sites threatened public safety and fueled direct acts of resistance directed at the police. Contrasting these findings, in Stockholm, policing reforms brought about by the central government paved the way for dialogue policing reforms. Dialogue policing suspended enforcement of nuisance laws in exchange for stronger relationships with policed groups, reduced incidence of violence, and diminished resistance to police efforts. The findings of the dissertation suggest the need to place greater focus on policy domains and institutional arrangements taking shape around penal organizations. Additionally, the research has policy implications as it pertains to policing reform. Namely, reform efforts aimed at reducing danger and racial bias in police practices would be served to target government actors which place untethered power in the hands of police organizations.},

abstract = {The meaning of “homes” is complicated for disabled people because of the historical link between (de)institutionalization, housing, and civil rights. But, it is unclear whether and how this history impacts Accessible Computing (AC) research in domestic spaces. We performed Critical Discourse Analysis on 101 AC articles to explore how (de)institutionalization affects domestic AC research. We found (de)institutionalization motivates goals of “independence” for disabled people. Yet, discourses of housing reflected institutional logics which are in tension with “independence”—complicating how goals were set, housing was understood, and design was approached. We outline three discourses of housing in AC and identify parallels to those used to justify institutionalization in the USA. We reflect upon their consequences for AC research. We offer principles derived from the Independent Living Movement as frameworks for challenging institutional conceptions of housing, to open new avenues for more holistic and anti-ableist domestic AC research.},

title = {Performing (For) Survival : Performance Tactics of Incarcerated Women},
year = {2014},
publisher = {The University of Northampton (United Kingdom)},
abstract = {In an era characterised by impacts of cuts and austerity in the UK, this study is positioned at the interface between two socio-cultural institutions against which societies are judged: the arts and criminal justice. Within this field, the thesis investigates the ways women in prison are positioned in a carceral performance that is cyclical and inevitably 'tragic'. The argument considers the tactics women use in order to firstly, survive their incarceration, and sometimes, resist, the institution. The theoretical frame is drawn from feminist criminology and Bourdieu's 'habitus' to examine everyday performances as well as theatrical works by and about incarcerated women. This project adds to the field by locating performance practices in and of prison within wider social contexts of the politics of carceral spaces. The main questions posed by this project were 'what does theatre/ performance offer to challenge stereotypes of 'the cage'?; and to what extent and in what ways does performance in (and of) prison challenge/ subvert/ augment/ transform the site itself'? The research sought to understand to what extent women's articulations of subjectivity could be a radical alternative to the logocentric and discursive prisons of sentences and prison records. The study was developed as an ethnographic examination of performance in and of prison, alongside exploring how contemporary performance modes are implicated in defining, containing, and correcting (criminal) women's everyday performances. The thesis is primarily concerned with a critical reflection on theatre practices in prison, with particular emphasis on the political implications of the effects of prison as/and performance. The study makes claims for a radical practice in and about prisons that is distanced from current applied theatre practices, and as such points towards a more troubled rehearsal of how punishment is performed.},

abstract = {Consumer surveillance products such as 'smart' doorbell cameras are an already-pervasive phenomenon in the U.S. These devices are marketed as personal and community security tools that allow users to answer their front door remotely, record "suspicious activity" captured by their cameras, and share reports with neighbors. The widespread use of doorbell cameras specifically, however, has created an opaque, wide-reaching surveillance network used by thousands of law enforcement agencies nationwide. The full breadth of this network and how users operate on such platforms is largely unknown. Amazon Ring, one of the largest manufacturers of smart doorbells, offers a companion social networking app to their physical doorbells called Ring Neighbors that allows camera owners to share video and text posts with other camera owners that live nearby. In this paper, we use data collected from public posts on Neighbors to create the first comprehensive map and analysis of smart doorbell camera use across the continental U.S. We use spatial regression methods to estimate the county-level predictors of Neighbors app usage nationally. We then use Los Angeles, one of the most active areas of Ring usage in the country, as a case study to investigate how different neighborhoods in a racially heterogeneous city use a platform like Ring. Using a structured topic analysis and experimental survey design, we show that users actively frame video subjects as criminal and suspicious, that the race of a neighborhood has a significant impact on posting rates, and provide some evidence that Neighbors may be used as a racial gatekeeping tool, particularly by white neighborhoods that border non-white areas in Los Angeles.},

abstract = {In the face of intensified datafication and automation in public-sector industries, frameworks like design justice and the feminist practice of refusal provide help to identify and mitigate structural harm and challenge inequities reproduced in digitized infrastructures. This paper applies those frameworks to emerging efforts across the U.S. healthcare industry to automate prior authorization - a process whereby insurance companies determine whether a treatment or service is “medically necessary” before agreeing to cover it. Federal regulatory interventions turn to datafication and automation to reduce the harms of this widely unpopular process shown to delay vital treatments and create immense administrative burden for healthcare providers and patients. This paper explores emerging prior authorization reforms as a case study, applying the frameworks of design justice and refusal to highlight the inherent conservatism of interventions oriented towards improving the user experience of extractive systems. I further explore how the abolitionist framework of non-reformist reform helps to clarify alternative interventions that would mitigate the harms of prior authorization in ways that do not reproduce or extend the power of insurance companies. I propose a set of four tenets for non-reformist design to mitigate structural harms and advance design justice in a broad set of domains.},

abstract = {Higher education is expanding in United States prisons, with a growing demand for STEM offerings. Academics from other disciplines have stressed the importance of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in prison higher education, and computing in context has shown major benefits in CS1--- especially for women and nontraditional students. More work is needed to determine what contexts are relevant to incarcerated college students, and how to incorporate these into computing curricula. In this paper, we build on prior work on computing in context and culturally relevant techniques in computing. We analyze course data from a CS1 course taught in a college-in-prison program to answer the following research question: What contexts do incarcerated students in CS1 find relevant? We identify 24 topics pursued by students across 78 open-ended programming assignment submissions, the three most popular being business management, sports statistics, and physical health. These results offer insight into potential contexts that are meaningful to incarcerated college students to be incorporated into future computing curricula and interventions in prisons.},

These governing institutions can be offline, such as the American healthcare system, and can also be online, such as online social platforms. As work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) frames technology-mediated support as one method to fill structural gaps in care, in this study, we ask the question: how do online and offline institutions influence how people in resource-scarce areas understand and express their distress online? We situate our work in U.S. Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (MHPSAs), or areas in which there are too few mental health professionals to meet expected needs. We use an analysis of illness narratives to answer this question, conducting a large scale linguistic analysis of social media posts to understand broader trends in expressions of distress online. We then build on these analyses via in-depth interviews with 18 participants with lived experience of mental illness, analyzing the role of online and offline institutions in how participants express distress online. Through our findings, we argue that a consideration of institutions is crucial in designing effective technology-mediated support, and discuss the implications of considering institutions in mental health support for platform designers.},

While alternative models provide hope for the future of online spaces, they can fail without proper scaffolding. Community moderators are routinely confronted with similar issues and have therefore found creative ways to navigate these challenges. Learning more about the decisions these moderators make, the challenges they face, and where they are successful can provide valuable insight into how to ensure alternative moderation models are successful.In this study, I perform a collaborative ethnography with moderators of r/AskHistorians, a community that uses an alternative moderation model, highlighting the importance of accounting for power in moderation. Drawing from Black feminist theory, I call this "intersectional moderation." I focus on three controversies emblematic of r/AskHistorians' alternative model of moderation: a disagreement over a moderation decision; a collaboration to fight racism on Reddit; and a period of intense turmoil and its impact on policy. Through this evidence I show how volunteer moderators navigated multiple layers of power through care work. To ensure the successful implementation of intersectional moderation, I argue that designers should support decision-making processes and policy makers should account for the impact of the sociotechnical systems in which moderators work.},

While some prior work has explored impacted stakeholders’ concerns with current uses of data-driven predictive risk models (PRMs), less work has asked stakeholders whether such tools ought to be used in the first place. In this work, we conducted a set of seven design workshops with 35 stakeholders who have been impacted by the child welfare system or who work in it to understand their beliefs and concerns around PRMs, and to engage them in imagining new uses of data and technologies in the child welfare system. We found that participants worried current PRMs perpetuate or exacerbate existing problems in child welfare. Participants suggested new ways to use data and data-driven tools to better support impacted communities and suggested paths to mitigate possible harms of these tools. Participants also suggested low-tech or no-tech alternatives to PRMs to address problems in child welfare. Our study sheds light on how researchers and designers can work in solidarity with impacted communities, possibly to circumvent or oppose child welfare agencies.},

abstract = {Growing awareness of the capacity of AI to inflict harm has inspired efforts to delineate principles for ‘trustworthy AI’ and, from these, objective indicators of ‘trustworthiness’ for auditors and regulators. Such efforts run the risk of formalizing a distinctly privileged perspective on trustworthiness which is insensitive (or else indifferent) to the legitimate reasons for distrust held by marginalized people. By exploring a neglected conative element of trust, we broaden understandings of trust and trustworthiness to make sense of, and identify principles for responding productively to, distrust of ostensibly ‘trustworthy’ AI. Bringing social science scholarship into dialogue with AI criticism, we show that AI is being used to construct a digital underclass that is rhetorically labelled as ‘undeserving’, and highlight how this process fulfills functions for more privileged people and institutions. We argue that distrust of AI is warranted and healthy when the AI contributes to marginalization and structural violence, and that Trustworthy AI may fuel public resistance to the use of AI unless it addresses this dimension of untrustworthiness. To this end, we offer reformulations of core principles of Trustworthy AI—fairness, accountability, and transparency—that substantively address the deeper issues animating widespread public distrust of AI, including: stewardship and care, openness and vulnerability, and humility and empowerment. In light of legitimate reasons for distrust, we call on the field to to re-evaluate why the public would embrace the expansion of AI into all corners of society; in short, what makes it worthy of their trust.},

abstract = {New artificial intelligence (AI) systems grounded in machine learning are being integrated into our lives at a rapid rate, but not without consequence: scholars across domains have increasingly pointed out issues related to privacy, transparency, bias, discrimination, exploitation, and exclusion associated with algorithmic systems in both public and private sector contexts. Concerns surrounding the adverse impacts of these technologies have spurred discussion on the topics of algorithmic harm. However, the overwhelming majority of articles on said harms offer no definition as to what constitutes ‘harm’ in these contexts. This paper aims to address this omission by introducing one criterion for a suitable account of algorithmic harm. More specifically, we follow Joel Feinberg in understanding harms as distinct from wrongs, where only the latter necessarily carry a normative dimension. This distinction highlights issues in the current scholarship surrounding the conflation of algorithmic harms and wrongs. In response to these issues, we put forth two requirements for upholding the harms/wrongs distinction when analyzing the increasingly far-reaching impacts of these technologies and suggest how this distinction can be useful in design, engineering, and policymaking.},

abstract = {Moderating online spaces effectively is not a matter of simply taking down content: moderators also provide private feedback and defuse situations before they cross the line into harm. However, moderators have little tool support for these activities, which often occur in the backchannel rather than in front of the entire community. In this paper, we introduce Chillbot, a moderation tool for Discord designed to facilitate backchanneling from moderators to users. With Chillbot, moderators gain the ability to send rapid anonymous feedback responses to situations where removal or formal punishment is too heavy-handed to be appropriate, helping educate users about how to improve their behavior while avoiding direct confrontations that can put moderators at risk. We evaluated Chillbot through a two week field deployment on eleven Discord servers ranging in size from 25 to over 240,000 members. Moderators in these communities used Chillbot more than four hundred times during the study, and moderators from six of the eleven servers continued using the tool past the end of the formal study period. Based on this deployment, we describe implications for the design of a broader variety of means by which moderation tools can help shape communities' norms and behavior.},

However, other work demonstrates how these interventions may instead serve to limit critique to that addressed within the intervention, while rendering broader concerns illegitimate. In this paper, drawing on work examining how standards enact discursive closure and how power relations affect whether and how people raise critique, we recruit three corporate teams, and one activist team, each with prior context working with one another, to play a game designed to trigger broad discussion around AI ethics. We use this as a point of contrast to trigger reflection on their teams' past discussions, examining factors which may affect their ''license to critique'' in AI ethics discussions. We then report on how particular affordances of this game may influence discussion, and find that the hypothetical context created in the game is unlikely to be a viable mechanism for real world change. We discuss how power dynamics within a group and notions of ''scope'' affect whether people may be willing to raise critique in AI ethics discussions, and discuss our finding that games are unlikely to enable direct changes to products or practice, but may be more likely to allow members to find critically-aligned allies for future collective action.},

abstract = {Transgender and nonbinary social media users experience disproportionate content removals on social media platforms, even when content does not violate platforms’ guidelines. In 2022, the Oversight Board, which oversees Meta platforms’ content moderation decisions, invited public feedback on Instagram’s removal of two trans users’ posts featuring their bare chests, introducing a unique opportunity to hear trans users’ feedback on how nudity and sexual activity policies impacted them. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 83 comments made public during the Oversight Board’s public comment process. Commenters criticized Meta’s nudity policies as enforcing a cisnormative view of gender while making it unclear how images of trans users’ bodies are moderated, enabling the disproportionate removal of trans content and limiting trans users’ ability to use Meta’s platforms. Yet there was significant divergence among commenters about how to address cisnormative moderation. Some commenters suggested that Meta clarify nudity guidelines, while others suggested that Meta overhaul them entirely, removing gendered distinctions or fundamentally reconfiguring the platform’s relationship to sexual content. We then discuss how the Oversight Board’s public comment process demonstrates the value of incorporating trans people’s feedback while developing policies related to gender and nudity, while arguing that Meta must go beyond only revising policy language by reevaluating how cisnormative values are encoded in all aspects of its content moderation systems.},

abstract = {Public records requests are a central mechanism for government transparency. In practice, they are slow, complex processes that require analyzing large amounts of messy, unstructured data. In this paper, we introduce RequestAtlas, a system that helps investigative journalists review large quantities of unstructured data that result from submitting many public records requests. RequestAtlas was developed through a year-long participatory design collaboration with the California Reporting Project (CRP), a journalistic collective researching police use of force and police misconduct in California. RequestAtlas helps journalists evaluate the results of public records requests for completeness and negotiate with agencies for additional information. RequestAtlas has had significant real-world impact. It has been deployed for more than a year to identify missing data in response to public records requests and to facilitate negotiation with public records request officers. Through the process of designing and observing the use of RequestAtlas, we explore the technical challenges associated with the public records request process and the design needs of investigative journalists more generally. We argue that public records requests represent an instance of an adversarial technical relationship in which two entities engage in a prolonged, iterative, often adversarial exchange of information. Technologists can support information-gathering efforts within these adversarial technical relationships by building flexible local solutions that help both entities account for the state of the ongoing information exchange. Additionally, we offer insights on ways to design applications that can assist investigative journalists in the inevitably significant data cleaning phase of processing large documents while supporting journalistic norms of verification and human review. Finally, we reflect on the ways that this participatory design process, despite its success, lays bare some of the limitations inherent in the public records request process and in the ''request and respond'' model of transparency more generally.},

abstract = {Risk assessments have proliferated in the United States criminal justice system. The theory of change motivating their adoption involves two key assumptions: first, that risk assessments will reduce human biases by making objective decisions, and second, that risk assessments will promote criminal justice reform. In this paper I interrogate both of these assumptions, concluding that risk assessments are an ill-advised tool for challenging the centrality and legitimacy of incarceration within the criminal justice system. First, risk assessments fail to provide objectivity, as their use creates numerous sites of discretion. Second, risk assessments provide no guarantee of reducing incarceration; instead, they risk legitimizing the criminal justice system's structural racism. I then consider, via an "epistemic reform," the path forward for criminal justice reform. I reinterpret recent results regarding the "impossibility of fairness" as not simply a tension between mathematical metrics but as evidence of a deeper tension between notions of equality. This expanded frame challenges the formalist, colorblind proceduralism at the heart of the criminal justice system and suggests a more structural approach to reform. Together, this analysis highlights how algorithmic fairness narrows the scope of judgments about justice and how "fair" algorithms can reinforce discrimination.},

We posit that the shift towards data-driven governance and organizing, by elevating a particular epistemology, can pave over other ways of knowing that are central to social movement practices. Building on Muravyov's [102] concept of ''epistemological ambiguity,'' we demonstrate how data-focused activism requires complex navigations between data-based epistemologies and the heterogeneous, experiential, and relational epistemologies that characterize social movements. Through three case studies (two drawn from existing literature and the third being an original analysis), we provide an analytical model of how generative epistemological refusals can support more value-aligned navigations of epistemological ambiguity that resist data-centrism. Finally, we suggest how these findings can inform pedagogy, research, and technology design to support communities navigating datafied political arenas.},

What happens when, instead, existing products are used to provide the foundational components for novel devices? We argue that post-consumer product reuse should be a central and ongoing concern in the design of interactive devices. This paper examines four case studies of interactive devices produced by reusing and repurposing existing consumer products. By critically analyzing these case studies, we demonstrate how reuse is leveraged in practice to exploit macro and micro economic niches. These case studies illustrate factors beyond noble ecological intent that make reuse sustainable: mechanical robustness, affordability, and technological bootstrapping. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities inherent to this mode of production.},

Local governments ostensibly aim to serve the public. So, some prior work has collaborated with local governments in the name of the public interest. However, others argue that local governments primarily police poor, minoritized communities, especially with increasingly limited funding for public services such as education or housing. These tensions raise critical questions: (How) should researchers collaborate with local governments? When should we oppose governments? How do we ethically engage with communities without being extractive? In this one-day workshop, we will bring together researchers from academia, the public sector, and community organizations to first take stock of work around public interest technologies. We will reflect on critical questions to orient the future of public interest technology and how we can work with, around, or against local governments while centering impacted communities.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan},

abstract = {On March 23, 2020, the Government of India (GoI) announced one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world to curb the spread of novel SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as CoVID-19. The country came to a standstill overnight and the service industry, including small businesses and restaurants, took a massive financial hit. The unknown nature of the virus and its spread deepened anxiety among the general public, quickly turning to distrust towards any “outside” contact with goods and people. In the hopes of (re)building consumer trust, food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy began providing digital solutions to exhibit care towards their customers, including: (1) sharing delivery workers’ live temperatures alongside the workers’ profile inside the app; (2) mandating the use of the controversial contact tracing app Aarogya Setu for the workers; (3) monitoring workers’ usage of masks through random selfie requests; and (4) sharing specific worker vaccination details on the app for customers to view, including vaccination date and the vaccine’s serial number. Such invasive data gathering infrastructures to address public health threats have long focused on the surveillance of laborers, migrants, and the bodies of other marginalized communities. Framed as public health management, such biometric and health data gathering is treated as a necessary feature of caring for the well-being of the general public. However, such datafication practices - ones which primarily focus on the extraction of data from one specific community in order to mollify the concerns of another - normalizes the false perception that disease is transmitted unidirectionally: from worker to the consumer. By centering food delivery workers’ experiences during the pandemic and examining the normalization of such surveillance in the name of care and recovery, this paper aims to examine how new regimes of care are manufactured and legitimized using harmful and unethical datafication practices.},

abstract = {In a world where information technologies (ITs) are globalizing and acting directly and explicitly on organizations, the question of property rights neutrality becomes strategic. In this study, the authors investigated whether ownership is a determinant of human resource performance or whether it is driven by factors other than ownership (e.g., technology and IT). Thus, the major objective of this research was to find out under what conditions ownership exerts a nonneutral effect on the performance of human resources and whether these effects are dependent on the technological aspects of organizations. The authors' methodology included two techniques, namely, nonparametric tests applied to the main indicators of 21 privatized companies (operating in the IT and other sectors) in the Tunisian case, and panel data to explain the impact of privatizations on human resources. The results showed that the privatization process has allowed an improvement in productivity indicators through an increase in incentive systems, particularly for companies with high technological content. The application of the econometric technique evidenced a whole policy of restructuring the allocation of human resources, in the postprivatization period. This makes sense because the incentive system of newly privatized companies strived to be more efficient. Furthermore, the second model showed that human resource dynamics after privatization depends on the business cycle and the nature of investors and IT. The third model confirmed the idea that privatization leads to an improvement in the workforce and its productivity in the long term. Overall, the study generated important managerial implications, the most important of which is that privatization can only generate a positive effect on human resource performance when employees feel involved in the process and as much as the organization is involved in new ITs.},

abstract = {Automated decision-making systems are increasingly deployed in domains such as hiring and credit approval where negative outcomes can have substantial ramifications for decision subjects. Thus, recent research has focused on providing explanations that help decision subjects understand the decision system and enable them to take actionable recourse to change their outcome. Popular counterfactual explanation techniques aim to achieve this by describing alterations to an instance that would transform a negative outcome to a positive one. Unfortunately, little user evaluation has been performed to assess which of the many counterfactual approaches best achieve this goal. In this work, we conduct a crowd-sourced between-subjects user study (N = 252) to examine the effects of counterfactual explanation type and presentation on lay decision subjects’ understandings of automated decision systems. We find that the region-based counterfactual type significantly increases objective understanding, subjective understanding, and response confidence as compared to the point-based type. We also find that counterfactual presentation significantly effects response time and moderates the effect of counterfactual type for response confidence, but not understanding. A qualitative analysis reveals how decision subjects interact with different explanation configurations and highlights unmet needs for explanation justification. Our results provide valuable insights and recommendations for the development of counterfactual explanation techniques towards achieving practical actionable recourse and empowering lay users to seek justice and opportunity in automated decision workflows.},

abstract = {The promise AI’s proponents have made for decades is one in which our needs are predicted, anticipated, and met - often before we even realize it. Instead, algorithmic systems, particularly AIs trained on large datasets and deployed to massive scales, seem to keep making the wrong decisions, causing harm and rewarding absurd outcomes. Attempts to make sense of why AIs make wrong calls in the moment explain the instances of errors, but how the environment surrounding these systems precipitate those instances remains murky. This paper draws from anthropological work on bureaucracies, states, and power, translating these ideas into a theory describing the structural tendency for powerful algorithmic systems to cause tremendous harm. I show how administrative models and projections of the world create marginalization, just as algorithmic models cause representational and allocative harm. This paper concludes with a recommendation to avoid the absurdity algorithmic systems produce by denying them power.},

abstract = {Challenges faced by formerly incarcerated individuals in the United States raise questions about our society’s ability to truly provide second chances. This paper presents the outcomes of our ongoing collaboration with a non-profit organization dedicated to reentry support. We highlight the multifaceted challenges individuals face during their reentry journey, including support programs that prioritize supervision over service, unresponsive support systems, limited access to resources, financial struggles exacerbated by restricted employment opportunities, and technological barriers. In the face of such complex social challenges, our work aims to facilitate our partner organization’s ongoing efforts to promote digital literacy through a web application that is integrated into their existing processes. We share initial feedback from the stakeholders, draw out four implications: supporting continuity of care, promoting reflection through slow technology, building in flexibility, and reconfiguring toward existing infrastructure, and conclude with a reflection on our role as partners on the side.},

year = {2024},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Graph neural network (GNN) link prediction is increasingly deployed in citation, collaboration, and online social networks to recommend academic literature, collaborators, and friends. While prior research has investigated the dyadic fairness of GNN link prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer women) fairness and "rich get richer" dynamics of link prediction remain underexplored. However, these aspects have significant consequences for degree and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed light on how degree bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link prediction. In particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our theoretical analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further bridge GCN's preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction and propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies disparities in link prediction scores within social groups, towards combating the amplification of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple training-time strategy to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that it is effective on citation, social, and credit networks.},

abstract = {As more algorithmic systems have come under scrutiny for their potential to inflict societal harms, an increasing number of organizations that hold power over harmful algorithms have chosen, or were required under the law, to abandon them. While social movements and calls to abandon harmful algorithms have emerged across application domains, little academic attention has been paid to studying abandonment as a means to mitigate algorithmic harms. In this paper, we take a first step towards conceptualizing “algorithm abandonment” as an organization’s decision to stop designing, developing, or using an algorithmic system due to its (potential) harms. We conduct a thematic analysis of real-world cases of algorithm abandonment to characterize the dynamics leading to this outcome. Our analysis of 40 cases reveals that campaigns to abandon an algorithm follow a common process of six iterative phases: discovery, diagnosis, dissemination, dialogue, decision, and death, which we term the 6 D’s of abandonment. In addition, we highlight key factors that facilitate (or prohibit) abandonment, which include characteristics of both the technical and social systems that the algorithm is embedded within. We discuss implications for several stakeholders, including proprietors and technologists who have the power to influence an algorithm’s (dis)continued use, FAccT researchers, and policymakers.},

abstract = {This paper examines the tensions between neighborhood gentrification and community surveillance posts on Nextdoor, a hyperlocal social media platform for neighborhoods. We created a privacy-preserving pipeline to gather research data from public Nextdoor posts in Atlanta, Georgia and filtered these to a dataset of 1,537 community surveillance posts. We developed a qualitative codebook to label observed patterns of community surveillance, and deploy a large language model to tag these posts at scale. Ultimately, we present an extensible and empirically-tested typology of the modes of community surveillance that occur on hyperlocal platforms. We find a complex relationship between community surveillance posts and neighborhood gentrification, which indicates that publicly disclosing information about perceived outsiders, especially for petty crimes, is most prevalent in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our empirical evidence inform critical perspectives which posit that community surveillance on platforms like Nextdoor can exclude and marginalize minoritized populations, particularly in gentrifying neighborhoods. Our findings carry broader implications for hyperlocal social platforms and their potential to amplify and exacerbate social tensions and exclusion.},

In our focus groups, participants (N=49) described harms they experienced through racism, misogynoir, ableism, and sexual objectification, and their complex labor of protecting and transforming their experiences online. Despite the harmful effects of unwanted behavior online, participants described a Black feminist transformative politic, in which they cultivated healing and joy through various methods offline and online. Using a transformative justice lens, we discuss their experiences of harassment from white women and men, as well as the complexities of cultural betrayal when experiencing harassment from Black men.},

Through a collaboration between a community organization in Detroit and a team of university researchers, we hosted and facilitated a five-week workshop series with Black and Brown working-class Detroiters where they collectively imagined alternative economic futures using speculative design. They proposed Community Capitalism, Childcare Collectives, and Village-Based Childcare as alternative economy concepts from the workshops and described their unique characteristics and traits of love, care, and inclusion. Aligning with generative justice frameworks, Detroiters prioritized sustainable families and communities. We contribute an understanding of technology’s role in the imagined economic futures, a discussion of what this means for community-involved governance, and a push for centering Afrofuturism in speculative design approaches to foster futures literacy.},

We examine the impact of shifting from in-person to online-only work on a particularly marginalized group of workers: sex workers. Through 34 qualitative interviews with sex workers from seven countries in the Global North, we examine how a shift to online-only sex work impacted: (1) working conditions, (2) risks and protective behaviors, and (3) labor rewards. We find that online work offers benefits to sex workers' financial and physical well-being. However, online-only work introduces new and greater digital and mental health risks as a result of the need to be publicly visible on more platforms and to share more explicit content. From our findings we propose design and platform governance suggestions for digital sex workers and for informal workers more broadly, particularly those who create and sell digital content.},

abstract = {This article presents Epistemic Spatialization as a new framework for investigating the interconnected patterns of biases when identifying objects with convolutional neural networks (convnets). It draws upon Foucault’s notion of spatialized knowledge to guide its method of enquiry. We argue that decisions involved in the creation of algorithms, alongside the labeling, ordering, presentation, and commercial prioritization of objects, together create a distorted “nomination of the visible”: they harden the visibility of some objects, make other objects excessively visible, and consign yet others to permanent or haphazard invisibility. Our approach differs from those who focus on high-stakes misidentifications, such as errors tied to structural racism. Examining the far more dominant series of low-stakes mistakes shows the scope of errors, destabilizing the goal of image content identification with considerable societal impact. We explore these issues by closely examining the demonstration video of a popular convnet. This examination reveals an interlocking series of biases undermining the content identification process. The picture we paint is crucial for a better understanding of the errors that result as these convnets become further embedded in everyday products.&nbsp;The framework is valuable for critical work on computer vision, AI studies, and large-scale visual analysis.},

Given AI fairness’ raison d’\^{e}tre of “fairness,” we argue that adopting intersectionality as an analytical framework is pivotal to effectively operationalizing fairness. Through a critical review of how intersectionality is discussed in 30 papers from the AI fairness literature, we deductively and inductively: 1) map how intersectionality tenets operate within the AI fairness paradigm and 2) uncover gaps between the conceptualization and operationalization of intersectionality. We find that researchers overwhelmingly reduce intersectionality to optimizing for fairness metrics over demographic subgroups. They also fail to discuss their social context and when mentioning power, they mostly situate it only within the AI pipeline. We: 3) outline and assess the implications of these gaps for critical inquiry and praxis, and 4) provide actionable recommendations for AI fairness researchers to engage with intersectionality in their work by grounding it in AI epistemology.},

abstract = {Recidivism risk assessment instruments are presented as an ‘evidence-based’ strategy for criminal justice reform – a way of increasing consistency in sentencing, replacing cash bail, and reducing mass incarceration. In practice, however, AI-centric reforms can simply add another layer to the sluggish, labyrinthine machinery of bureaucratic systems and are met with internal resistance. Through a community-informed interview-based study of 23 criminal judges and other criminal legal bureaucrats in Pennsylvania, I find that judges overwhelmingly ignore a recently-implemented sentence risk assessment instrument, which they disparage as “useless,” “worthless,” “boring,” “a waste of time,” “a non-thing,” and simply “not helpful.” I argue that this algorithm aversion cannot be accounted for by individuals’ distrust of the tools or automation anxieties, per the explanations given by existing scholarship. Rather, the instrument’s non-use is the result of an interplay between three organizational factors: county-level norms about pre-sentence investigation reports; alterations made to the instrument by the Pennsylvania Sentencing Commission in response to years of public and internal resistance; and problems with how information is disseminated to judges. These findings shed new light on the important role of organizational influences on professional resistance to algorithms, which helps explain why algorithm-centric reforms can fail to have their desired effect. This study also contributes to an empirically-informed argument against the use of risk assessment instruments: they are resource-intensive and have not demonstrated positive on-the-ground impacts.},

Stemming from this vision, we make recommendations for how researchers and designers can support more equitable futures for people experiencing mental distress and illness.},

abstract = {The use of AI algorithms in criminal trials has been the subject of very lively ethical and legal debates recently. While there are concerns over the lack of accuracy and the harmful biases that certain algorithms display, new algorithms seem more promising and might lead to more accurate legal decisions. Algorithms seem especially relevant for bail decisions, because such decisions involve statistical data to which human reasoners struggle to give adequate weight. While getting the right legal outcome is a strong desideratum of criminal trials, advocates of the relational theory of procedural justice give us good reason to think that fairness and perceived fairness of legal procedures have a value that is independent from the outcome. According to this literature, one key aspect of fairness is trustworthiness. In this paper, I argue that using certain algorithms to assist bail decisions could increase three different aspects of judges’ trustworthiness: (1) actual trustworthiness, (2) rich trustworthiness, and (3) perceived trustworthiness.},

Analysis of epistemic burden encourages researchers to rethink the purpose and value of data in community organizing and activism more generally. This paper describes three varieties of epistemic burden drawn from two case studies based on the authors’ previous work with anti-police brutality community organizations. The authors conclude with a discussion of ways to alleviate and avoid these issues through a series of questions about participatory research design.

abstract = {In this paper, we explore temporal and technological conjunctures of community-based design responsiveness based upon our experiences of making an interactive digital story map amid housing crises. Through reflexive ethnographic work with the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, we trace three intertwined genres of temporality in our community-based design process: slow design with care; rapid design in response to the urgency of crises; and disruptive design that seeps in from Silicon Valley, proving to “move fast and break things.” We assess temporal tensions and contradictions in an evolving data landscape by examining struggles over our pace of practice, time-based media lifecycles, and tooling trade-offs. Theorizing community-based design dilemmas, we contemplate ways of mindfully designing with time, making the past present via digital storytelling, and reimagining technological relations over time.},

abstract = {In this paper I argue that some examples of what we label ‘algorithmic bias’ would be better understood as cases of institutional bias. Even when individual algorithms appear unobjectionable, they may produce biased outcomes given the way that they are embedded in the background structure of our social world. Therefore, the problematic outcomes associated with the use of algorithmic systems cannot be understood or accounted for without a kind of structural account. Understanding algorithmic bias as institutional bias in particular (as opposed to other structural accounts) has at least two important upshots. First, I argue that the existence of bias that is intrinsic to certain institutions (whether algorithmic or not) suggests that at least in some cases, the algorithms now substituting as pieces of institutional norms or rules are not “fixable” in the relevant sense, because the institutions they help make up are not fixable. Second, I argue that in other cases, changing the algorithms being used within our institutions (rather than getting rid of them entirely) is essential to changing the background structural conditions of our society.},

abstract = {Examinations of intersectionality and identity dimensions in accessibility research have primarily considered disability separately from a person’s race and ethnicity. Accessibility work often does not include considerations of race as a construct, or treats race as a shallow demographic variable, if race is mentioned at all. The lack of attention to race as a construct in accessibility research presents an oversight in our field, often systematically eliminating whole areas of need and vital perspectives from the work we do. Further, there has been little focus on the intersection of race and disability within accessibility research, and the relevance of their interplay. When research in race or disability does not mention the other, this work overlooks the potential to better understand the full nuance of marginalized and “otherized” groups. To address this gap, we present a series of case studies exploring the potential for research that lies at the intersection of race and disability. We provide examples of how to integrate racial equity perspectives into accessibility research, through positive examples found in these case studies and reflect on teaching at the intersection of race, disability, and technology. This paper highlights the value of considering how constructs of race and disability work alongside each other within accessibility research studies, designs of socio-technical systems, and education. Our analysis provides recommendations towards establishing this research direction.},

CBO workers often act as linguistic and cultural translators between communities, government, and health and social service systems. However, resource constraints, technological barriers, and pressures to be data-driven require workers to perform additional forms of translation to ensure their organizations’ survival. Drawing on 16 interviews with members of 7 Asian American and Pacific Islander CBOs, we examine opportunities and barriers concerning their technology-mediated work practices. We identify two circumstances where CBO workers perform translation: (1) as legitimacy work to build trust with funders and communities, and (2) as (re)mediation in attending to technological barriers and resisting hegemonic systems that treat their communities as “other.” By unpacking the politics of translation work across these sites, we position CBO workers as a critical source for HCI research and practice as it seeks to support community wellbeing.},

Unhoused persons are vulnerable and using their data in the ML pipeline raises serious concerns about the unintended harms and consequences of prioritizing different ML values. To address this, we conducted a critical analysis of 40 research papers identified through a systematic literature review in ML homelessness service provision research. We found that the values of novelty, performance, and identifying limitations were uplifted in these papers, whereas (in)efficiency, (low/high) cost, fast, (violated) privacy, and (homeless condition) reproducibility valuescollapse. Consequently, unhoused persons were lost (i.e., humans were deprioritized) at multi-level ML abstraction of predictors, categories, and algorithms. Our findings illuminate potential pathways forward at the intersection of data science, HCI and STS by situating humans at the center to support this vulnerable community.},

abstract = {In human networks, nodes belonging to a marginalized group often have a dispro-portionate rate of unknown or missing features. This, in conjunction with graph structure and known feature biases, can cause graph feature imputation algorithms to predict values for unknown features that make the marginalized group's feature values more distinct from the the dominant group's feature values than they are in reality. We call this distinction the discrimination risk. We prove that a higher discrimination risk can amplify the unfairness of a machine learning model applied to the imputed data. We then formalize a general graph feature imputation framework called mean aggregation imputation and theoretically and empirically characterize graphs in which applying this framework can yield feature values with a high &lt;b&gt;discrimination risk&lt;/b&gt;. We propose a simple algorithm to ensure mean aggregation-imputed features provably have a low discrimination risk, while minimally sacrificing reconstruction error (with respect to the imputation objective).We evaluate the fairness and accuracy of our solution on synthetic and real-world credit networks.},

However, questions remain about how people are currently using these devices to monitor and surveil, what the benefits and limitations are for users, and what privacy and security tensions arise between primary users and other stakeholders. We present an empirical study with 14 SHC users to understand how these devices are used and integrated within everyday life. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews, we investigate users’ motivations, practices, privacy concerns, and social negotiations. Our findings highlight the SHC as a perceptually powerful and spatially sensitive device that enables a variety of surveillant uses outside of basic home security—from formally surveilling domestic workers, to casually spying on neighbors, to capturing memories. We categorize surveillant SHC uses, clarify distinctions between primary and non-primary users, and highlight under-considered design directions for addressing power imbalances among primary and non-primary users.},

To explore this challenge, this paper describes the design of a community-based conversational storytelling agent (CSA) to document digital stories of housing insecurity. Building on insights from an ongoing grassroots project, the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, we share how a study initially focused on CSA-support opened an investigation of the role that artificial intelligence may play in housing justice movements. Drawing from 17 interviews with narrators of housing insecurity experiences and collectors of such stories, we find that collectors perceive opportunities to expand means of documentation with multimedia and multi-language support. Meanwhile, some narrators perceive potential for a CSA to offer therapeutic storytelling experiences and document otherwise unrecorded stories. Yet, CSA encounters also surface perils of machine bias, as well as reduced possibilities of human connections and relations.},

Less is known about the last mile of the computer-vision machine-learning pipeline: on-the-ground integration into the real world. In this paper, I&nbsp;analyze facial verification technology (FVT) through its use as account verification in ride-hail work. Using a sociotechnical framework combined with empirical qualitative research methods, including interviews and analysis of an online community of workers, this research is a deep dive into recognition technologies at the level of local practice.&nbsp;Findings reveal the high-stakes articulation labor demanded of workers to be recognized by these systems, including maintaining multiple mobile devices, repeatedly uploading requisite images, spending time and resources visiting customer-service centers, and making physical changes to their bodies and environments. These strategies constitute repairs to the failures of computer vision in dynamic environments and are required to successfully engage in the sociotechnical interaction protocols demanded by FVT. Drawing on Erving Goffman's terminology around social interaction rituals, I term these cognitive and behavioral negotiations "face work." Drivers' dynamic, responsive, and ad-hoc attempts to become machine-readable have significant implications for relations between identity and power in spaces of security and work, as well as for the integration of machine-learning systems into safety-critical infrastructures. Ultimately, this research emphasizes the crucial role of end users who create and maintain the conditions required for computer vision to produce judgment.},

We report on generative interviews with mentors experienced in supporting youth, as part of design work initiated by community leaders concerned about the traumatic effects of gun violence and systemic racism on local youth. These community leaders wanted to extend their existing mentoring efforts through digital technology. We identified attachment theory as the best fit for helping us understand how mentors are addressing trauma among youth, in ways that can inform how we design in support of these relationships and communities. We introduce attachment-informed design as a set of design principles that represent a novel approach to digital mental health interventions.},

abstract = {Most machine learning systems that interact with humans construct some notion of a person’s “identity,” yet the default paradigm in AI research envisions identity with essential attributes that are discrete and static. In stark contrast, strands of thought within critical theory present a conception of identity as malleable and constructed entirely through interaction; a doing rather than a being. In this work, we distill some of these ideas for machine learning practitioners and introduce a theory of identity as autopoiesis, circular processes of formation and function. We argue that the default paradigm of identity used by the field immobilizes existing identity categories and the power differentials that co-occur, due to the absence of iterative feedback to our models. This includes a critique of emergent AI fairness practices that continue to impose the default paradigm. Finally, we apply our theory to sketch approaches to autopoietic identity through multilevel optimization and relational learning. While these ideas raise many open questions, we imagine the possibilities of machines that are capable of expressing human identity as a relationship perpetually in flux.},

Three different street outreach organizations in Chicago adopted the app for two months. Results suggest that the app supported SOWs' transformative justice practices to build a counter-structure to traditional policing, which is historically oppressive to Black communities. The SOWs used the app to mediate potentially violent conflicts without police involvement, build community through in-person events, and extend their communities of care through positive stories and narratives that countered harmful stereotypes about Black criminality. By affording SOWs more agency over their communication with each other, the app enabled SOWs to connect their strengths and scale their existing practices that combat structural oppression and prefigure liberatory futures.},

We conducted interviews with 15 individuals who may get/were pregnant to address this gap. While nearly all reported deleting period tracking apps, they were not willing to go much further, even while acknowledging the risks of generating data. Quite a few considered a more inhospitable, Handmaid's Tale like climate in which their medical history and movements would put them in legal peril but felt that, by definition, this reality was insuperable, and also that they were not the target—the notion that privileged location, stage of life did not make them the focus of government or vigilante efforts. We also found that certain individuals (often younger and/or with reproductive risks) were more attuned to the need to modify their technology or equipped to employ high and low-tech strategies. Using an intersectional lens, we discuss implications for media advocacy and propose privacy intermediation to frame our thinking about reproductive privacy.},

abstract = {CSCW, like many other academic communities, is reckoning with its roles, responsibilities, and practices amidst 2020's multiple pandemics of COVID-19, anti-Black racism, and a global economic crisis. Reviewing our work with data and communities demands we address harms from overexposure caused by surveillance or algorithmic bias and from underexposure caused by design that is insufficiently participatory and equitable. This workshop will elicit narratives of good and bad design and data work with communities, apply the lenses of equitable participatory design and data feminism to current CSCW projects and our global context, and develop practical outputs for supporting academics and practitioners in pursuit of democratic and just partnerships.},

abstract = {All language is characterised by variation which language users employ to construct complex social identities and express social meaning. Like other machine learning technologies, speech and language technologies (re)produce structural oppression when they perform worse for marginalised language communities. Using knowledge and theories from sociolinguistics, I explore why commercial automatic speech recognition systems and other language technologies perform significantly worse for already marginalised populations, such as second-language speakers and speakers of stigmatised varieties of English in the British Isles. Situating language technologies within the broader scholarship around algorithmic bias, consider the allocative and representational harms they can cause even (and perhaps especially) in systems which do not exhibit predictive bias, narrowly defined as differential performance between groups. This raises the question whether addressing or “fixing” this “bias” is actually always equivalent to mitigating the harms algorithmic systems can cause, in particular to marginalised communities.},

Rather than attempt to eliminate bias through seeking fairness in algorithms, regulatory intervention or a race-blind stance, this paper seeks to correct the balance by adopting an explictly anti-racist approach to the design of sociotechnical systems. As a research-through-design initiative, we bring techniques from critical technical practice to bear on revealing and inverting assumptions in HCI, attempting to produce alternative sociotechnical systems that aim not merely to reveal or correct but to destablize or dismantle systems of oppression. We articulate core principles to guide such work and articulate four system prototypes to interrogate anti-racist HCI as a potential form of critical technical practice. We conclude with discussion of the challenges that face anti-racist HCI in terms of timing, reflection, and failure, addressing what an anti-racist critical technical practice reveals about the enduring structural sources of inequity in the products and practices of HCI.},

This year's conference is particularly special, as it marks the first time CSCW to be held in Latin America - a highly anticipated milestone for our Latin American community. We are excited to gather in San Jose, Costa Rica, and host a hybrid event that allows remote participation from community members worldwide.As in previous years, CSCW 2024 brings together a variety of disciplines, from system design to critical analysis, to propose, examine, and reimagine technologies that support groups and communities. As our discipline evolves, new topics continuously emerge and are embraced by our community. This year, we see an emphasis on issues centered around AI, including explainability, fairness, and AI-human collaboration. At the same time, our long-standing concerns remain well represented, including work on group dynamics and decision-making, social media, inclusive and culturally aware design, co-design with marginalized communities, and the creation of socially responsible tools. This year, we invited 387 PACM-HCI, TSC, and TOCHI papers to be presented alongside a diverse lineup of workshops, posters, demos, SIGs, panels, and the doctoral consortium. Below are the numbers of reviewed and accepted submissions for each track featured in this conference companion.},

Platforms rely on sanctions like removing content or banning users but these punitive responses provide little opportunity for justice or reparation for targets of harassment. This may be especially important for youth, who experience pervasive harassment which can have uniquely harmful effects on their wellbeing. We conducted a text-message based survey with 832 U.S. adolescents and young adults, ages 14-24, to explore their attitudes towards social media companies' responses to online harassment. We find that youth are twice as likely (41% versus 20%) not to trust social media companies' ability to achieve a fair resolution as they are to trust them. Nearly two-thirds (62%) of youth expressed a preference for an apology from the offender after online harassment, and they were twice as likely to prefer a private apology to a public one (29% versus 14%). Preferences also vary by identity, revealing how a one-size-fits-all approach can harm some youth while benefitting others. We reflect on the opportunities and risks associated with institutional trust and restorative justice for supporting youth who experience online harassment.},

Drawing on a mix of archival materials, participant observation, and interviews within and around two mid- to large cities in the Rust Belt and Midwest regions of the United States, we consider how public officials introduced digital meeting platforms and surveys in place of traditional forms of in-person public consultation. We also examine emergent strategies of residents as they worked to have their voices heard and concerns met during a time of compounding crises (e.g., pandemic, economic recession, racial violence). Drawing from this case study, we articulate the concept of disruptive testimony, forms of public witnessing that trouble established hierarchies of power, surface conflict, and open opportunities for social change. We argue consideration for collective counter-power is increasingly important to GROUP scholarship as it attends to civic engagement beyond participation in formal, sanctioned government processes.},

We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is "Leading the Transformation". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.},

abstract = {In the United States, public defenders (lawyers assigned to people accused of crimes who cannot afford a private attorney) serve as an essential bulwark against wrongful arrest and incarceration for low-income and marginalized people. Public defenders have long been overworked and under-resourced. However, these issues have been compounded by increases in the volume and complexity of data in modern criminal cases. We explore the technology needs of public defenders through a series of semi-structured interviews with public defenders and those who work with them. We find that public defenders' ability to reason about novel surveillance data is woefully inadequate not only due to a lack of resources and knowledge, but also due to the structure of the criminal justice system, which gives prosecutors and police (in partnership with private companies) more control over the type of information used in criminal cases than defense attorneys. We find that public defenders may be able to create fairer situations for their clients with better tools for data interpretation and access. Therefore, we call on technologists to attend to the needs of public defenders and the people they represent when designing systems that collect data about people. Our findings illuminate constraints that technologists and privacy advocates should consider as they pursue solutions. In particular, our work complicates notions of individual privacy as the only value in protecting users' rights, and demonstrates the importance of data interpretation alongside data visibility. As data sources become more complex, control over the data cannot be separated from access to the experts and technology to make sense of that data. The growing surveillance data ecosystem may systematically oppress not only those who are most closely observed, but groups of people whose communities and advocates have been deprived of the storytelling power over their information.},

abstract = {This survey article assesses and compares existing critiques of current fairness-enhancing technical interventions in machine learning (ML) that draw from a range of non-computing disciplines, including philosophy, feminist studies, critical race and ethnic studies, legal studies, anthropology, and science and technology studies. It bridges epistemic divides in order to offer an interdisciplinary understanding of the possibilities and limits of hegemonic computational approaches to ML fairness for producing just outcomes for society’s most marginalized. The article is organized according to nine major themes of critique wherein these different fields intersect: 1) how "fairness" in AI fairness research gets defined; 2) how problems for AI systems to address get formulated; 3) the impacts of abstraction on how AI tools function and its propensity to lead to technological solutionism; 4) how racial classification operates within AI fairness research; 5) the use of AI fairness measures to avoid regulation and engage in ethics washing; 6) an absence of participatory design and democratic deliberation in AI fairness considerations; 7) data collection practices that entrench “bias,” are non-consensual, and lack transparency; 8) the predatory inclusion of marginalized groups into AI systems; and 9) a lack of engagement with AI’s long-term social and ethical outcomes. Drawing from these critiques, the article concludes by imagining future ML fairness research directions that actively disrupt entrenched power dynamics and structural injustices in society.},

We designed a series of discursive activities involving 16 individuals from ten households for six weeks in their everyday settings. These activities functioned as speculative probes—prompting participants to reflect on themes of privacy and power through filming with cameras in their households. Our research design foregrounded critical-playful enactments that allowed participants to speculate potentials for relationships with cameras in the home beyond everyday use. We present four key dynamics with participants and home cameras by examining their relationships to: the camera's eye, filming, their data, and camera's societal contexts. We contribute discussions about the mundane, information privacy, and post-hoc reflection with one's camera footage. Overall, our findings reveal the camera as a strange, yet banal entity in the home—interrogating how participants compose and handle their own and others’ video data.},

Critical story and production elements, including screenplay, acting, and narration, were created with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women. The institutional, technological, and cultural restrictions of prison, combined with the tensions of making media with often exploited groups, forced adaptations of participatory design methods. The inclusion of incarcerated female voices resulted in an immersive narrative that reflects this group's specific challenges. The next phase is to evaluate its efficacy against non-immersive comparative trainings for reentry-related anxieties.},

abstract = {This book offers a compelling discussion of the digital dreams that have come true, their often unintended side effects (nightmares), and what must be done to counteract the nightmares. It is intended as an impetus to further conversation not only in homes and workplaces, but in academic courses and even legislative debates. Equally importantly, the book is a presentation of what digital technology professionals need to know about these topics and the actions they should undertake individually and in support of other citizens, societal initiatives, and government. The author begins by introducing the amazing progress made in digital technologies over the past 80 years. Pioneering engineers dreamed of potential uses of technology through their writing and technical achievements, further inspiring thousands of researchers to bring the dreams to life, and to dream new dreams as well. The second part of the book describes the myriad adverse side effects and unanticipated challenges that arose as those dreams were pursued and achieved. Examples include rampant misinformation on social media, ransomware, autonomous weapons, and the premature use of AI before it is reliable and safe.The book closes with a positive call to action, outlining ways to address the challenges through ethical career choices, careful analysis, thoughtful design, research, citizen engagement, legislation/regulation, and careful consideration of how bad actors may use technology. Readers of Digital Dreams Have Become Nightmares should become more knowledgeable, wiser, and also cautiously optimistic, determined to affect positive changes through their design, creation, and use of technology.“Are you feeling happy about the role of information technology in the world today? You should read this book for a dose of reality. Are you in despair about it? This book is the prescription for that condition, too! Nobody else could cover the landscape as Ron Baecker does.” - Clayton Lewis, Emeritus Professor, University of Colorado Boulder“This book is a captivating review of important computing developments. Many things talked about as new today have been around for a long time. Much can be learned from the past. The book also teaches a careful and consistent method that enables the reader to do this kind of work as the need arises. The book suggests the need will arise.” - John Leslie King, Emeritus Professor, University of Michigan}

Though proponents herald their role in offering lightweight solutions to disconnected transit, smart scooters and autonomous delivery robots increasingly occupy pedestrian pathways, reanimating tensions around the right to public space. Drawing on interviews with disabled activists, government officials, and commercial representatives, we chart how devices and policies co-evolve to fulfill municipal sustainability goals, while creating obstacles for people with disabilities whose activism has long resisted inaccessible infrastructure. We reflect on efforts to redistribute space, institute tech governance, and offer accountability to those who involuntarily encounter interventions on the ground. In studying micromobility within spatial and political context, we call for the HCI community to consider how innovation transforms as it moves out from centers of development toward peripheries of design consideration.},

abstract = {In today’s digital age, searching for information online is considered a ubiquitous task that can be accomplished in just a few moments using various web-based technologies. Yet, information seeking has geopolitical burdens for users who are racialized and marginalized by the nation-state and other structures of power. In our paper, we conducted a qualitative interview study with 15 Muslim participants, mostly of South Asian origin, living in the US with varying citizenship or (non)immigration status about their information needs and concerns around privacy as a Muslim, and the resulting restrictive patterns of information seeking on various Internet platforms. We argue that our findings on the barriers faced and strategies employed by Muslim residents toward information access suggest a broader pattern of digital manifestations of border imperialism. We posit that HCI researchers should pay attention to how “digital borders" have epistemic implications for people marginalized by geopolitical boundaries.},

abstract = {The increasing integration of AI and data-driven technologies in various sectors of society presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly regarding ethical, fair, and inclusive applications. This one-day workshop aims to convene researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other community members to explore the complexities of community-driven AI with the aim to promote responsible and sustainable practices in the AI ecosystem. Drawing on interdisciplinary perspectives, participants will engage in discussions focused on themes such as understanding stakeholder relationships and positions in AI systems, evaluating community impact in AI ecosystems, examining policy and intervention implications, and devising strategies for effective partnership and collaboration with communities. The workshop will provide a platform for sharing experiences, exchanging ideas, and fostering long-lasting collaborations. By collectively addressing the challenges and opportunities in community-driven AI, we aspire to build an active community that supports ethical, inclusive, and sustainable AI-driven solutions, empowering communities in an increasingly data-driven world.},

abstract = {Privacy in countries such as India is poorly protected by the legislative and is under increasing threat from new technologies. Strong cultural elements in Indian society multiply the issue. A democratic alternative could be to provoke individuals to come forward and discuss their issues. This will enable better designs of current and future systems especially in the workplace, which collect and maintain private information. To stimulate this participatory environment this paper develops scenarios imagining an invasive environment. The scenarios include one in which a rest-room displays one's identity and another in which a coffee cup keeps track of one's language. Initial reviews on these scenarios provide insights into the approach.},

abstract = {Business history has become an increasingly inter-disciplinary space, and has been rejuve nated by this inter-disciplinarity. Despite the theoretical openness of business history, and his influence elsewhere in the social sciences and humanities, Michel Foucault has had lit tle or no impact outside the specialist niche of accounting history. Foucault's central text for many historians is his study of the emergence of the modern penitentiary, Discipline and Punish (1977). Here we follow Foucault's lead by examining the factories of the industrial revolution, focusing on the influence of Jeremy Bentham and Robert Owen's New Lanark in the first and second sections of the paper respectively, using these cases as the basis for a discussion of Foucault's implications for business history. In the third and final section, we draw attention to the centrality of the body in Foucault's work.},
