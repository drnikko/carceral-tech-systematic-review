"Computing marginal expectations for large compartmentalized models with application to AIDS evolution in a prison system","S. YAKOWITZ; M. BLOUNT; J. GANI",NA; NA; NA,Mathematical Medicine and Biology: A Journal of the IMA,"18 Jan 2018","1996","13","4","223","244","The customary models for the AIDS epidemic are compartmentalized according to criteria such as risk factors, sexual habits, gender, race, age, and HIV status and stage. Hitherto, with very few exceptions, investigators have resorted to deterministic approximations or to simulation for the computational investigation of such models, which do not yield to purely analytic methods. The present paper describes a numerical technique, not dependent on Monte Carlo simulations, for such compartmentalized Markov population processes. Analytic error bounds and computational evidence suggest that this technique is quite accurate. The study is motivated and illustrated by a model for a prison system, with ten interrelated prisons, twenty compartments, and thousands of individuals. This model is of increasing interest in itself because the HIV/AIDS epidemic is particularly virulent among prison populations, where the environment offers special opportunities to investigate various prevention and educational programmes quantitatively. Our computational techniques are shown to be effective for the analysis of such a prison system, even though the resulting Markov process is an order of magnitude more complicated than other stochastic epidemic models currently being investigated. The modelling approach and numerical device appear to be applicable to a wide variety of population processes involving migration between population patches.","1477-8602","","10.1093/imammb/13.4.223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8145280","HIV infection;deterministic and stochastic epidemic;models;prisons;numerical methods for Markov chains","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Throughout history, there has been a predominant focus on the concepts of deterrence and retribution, rather than prioritizing the rehabilitation process. Nevertheless, with the transformation of the state's position from a laissez-faire stance to that of a welfare state, there has been a notable transition towards emphasizing the rehabilitation of incarcerated individuals.

It then examines the methods used to estimate this probability, and the way these methods are presented by experts in court.

This evolutionary process has led to some obvious shortcomings. The Prison Service has placed a contract for the development of a system designed to overcome these limitations and which will be matched to the specific needs of the prison system. The project is known as Concept 2000, and is a partnership with the prison services of Scotland and Northern Ireland. The prototype system will be exhaustively tested at the Prison Service College, prior to its introduction at selected prisons. The intention is to integrate all existing systems into an open architecture which allows any operator to deal with any of the functions of the control room, with the tasks being allocated intelligently to the operators, each of whom works at an identical workstation. The tasks will be allocated using a knowledge based system and will allow various allocation strategies to be implemented. The main operating software will be based on commercially available industrial control products, proven in real-time, safety-critical applications. Before describing the system in more detail, the paper discusses some of the underlying principles that led to the design.","","0-7803-5247-5","10.1109/CCST.1999.797899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=797899","","Control systems;Contracts;Prototypes;System testing;Educational institutions;Workstations;Knowledge based systems;Software safety;Industrial control;Application software","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since Taiwan is located in the “ Circum-Pacific seismic belt” in the seismically active area, and there are 42 fault zones at the junction of the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, the exposure to the chance of buildings’ falling down has become a public concern.If a very strong earthquake (Earthquake Magnitude Scale 7 or higher) strikes in the future 50 years, the correctional institution in Hsinchu will be specified as severe red earthquake alert level, worse than any other regions in Taiwan. The current research applies the Simple Earthquake Seismic System (SESS) and Taiwan Earthquake Loss Estimation System (TELES) to conduct earthquake simulations in Hsinchu to assess hazards and risks, the potential or possibilities of the occurrence of destruction of lives and infrastructure around the Hsinchu correctional institution. The loss modeling shows that 8,176 buildings collapse and the death toll is 500 in the case of TELES, while 21 buildings fall down and fatality estimation is 1,013 in the case of SESS.

The ever growing inmate population has put a strain on the already limited jail resources. As the jail becomes more crowded, it is even more difficult to rehabilitate inmates. Consequently, recidivism is a continuous problem, putting added pressure on the criminal justice system and community. The project team developed a logic model to explain possible contributors to jail overcrowding. After performing analysis on the existing law enforcement and jail databases, the team focused on the opportunity for a coherent criminal justice data system that would support analysis and provide an accessible user interface. Such a database will enable jail management to make evidence-based decisions and will provide stakeholders with the necessary statistics to hold each member in the system accountable. These statistics will also serve as indices of performance and will assess the success of programs. In the long-term, such decisions will help alleviate overcrowding at ACRJ by reducing recidivism and delays in the system.","","978-1-4577-0447-5","10.1109/SIEDS.2011.5876879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876879","","Databases;Measurement;Communities;Safety;Analytical models;Law enforcement;Data models","","2","","5","IEEE","16 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More than 2.3 million people currently live in US prisons or jails-25 percent of the world's total inmate population-a comparatively much higher rate than in other Western countries. Denmark only incarcerates 66 of every 100,000 citizens, compared to 760 in the US. This situation results from tough sentencing policies that focus on drug use and habitual offenders. Over three decades, these policies contributed to high incarceration rates and resulting high costs. Self-service systems as well as biometric tracking are seen as a means to reduce the management burden. Self-service kiosks in corrections facilities are a relatively new but growing phenomenon. In 2006, the Corrections Technology Association conducted a survey on the use of computer-based kiosks to help corrections agencies make decisions on implementing kiosk-based systems. The results indicated considerable interest in using kiosks for a range of applications, including distribution of general information, display of inmate account balances, purchase of goods from the commissary, and depositing inmate funds. A wide range of applications are possible. Current efforts focus on existing services, but digital technology creates possibilities for new service types that can exploit the direct distribution model, such as a law library and the digital media distribution of music, literature, films, and images managed through the kiosks and downloaded onto appropriate secure devices, such as MP3 players. To help succeed in reducing the management cost a common platform is required. Prisons and suppliers must agree on a set of protocols for data exchange and communication methods. This framework and the base kiosk functionality will enable developers to produce better applications, which can be used in more prisons without having to rewrite all the base functionality. To this end, this talk intends to launch a joint IEEE TC-ECBS and TC-AAS industrial working group to establish such standards for a common platform.","","978-1-4244-6538-5","10.1109/ECBS.2010.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457792","","Biometrics;Costs;Application software;Turning;Drugs;Computer displays;Appropriate technology;Software libraries;Technology management;Digital audio players","","","","1","IEEE","3 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Offender data were collected from Jefferson Area Community Corrections, Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, and Region Ten Community Services Board for the period July 2015 through February 2016, including data from the Brief Jail Mental Health Screen to identify individuals who are likely suffering from mental illness. The collected data also include actuarial risk, bonding and sentencing decisions, time served, and receipt of mental health services. Inmates who were referred for further evaluation had several differing characteristics compared to inmates that were not referred for further mental health evaluation. The two groups differed in the types of crimes committed. Inmates referred for further mental health evaluation spent more time in jail and had longer sentences overall compared to all other inmates controlling for actuarial risk. Continued collection of data and further analysis are needed to draw conclusions about the treatment of mentally ill individuals in Charlottesville's criminal justice system.","","978-1-5090-0970-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489308","Criminal justice;evidence-based decision making;mental illness","Sociology;Statistics;Risk management;Conferences;Data collection;Decision making;Bonding","","2","","5","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For most of these inmates, their untreated mental health needs contribute to their return to custody within the criminal justice system. A 2011 study reported that approximately 68% of inmates with an untreated mental illness and substance abuse diagnoses return to custody at least once within 4 years of the initial release, compared to 60% of those who do not suffer from either mental illness or substance abuse diagnoses (Bronson et al., 2017). This project extends over a decade of prior research examining current mental health services available to those released from the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ). The primary objective of this project was to identify individuals within the ACRJ, which serves jurisdictions in Charlottesville, Albemarle, and Nelson County who were recommended for services following screening through the Brief Jail Mental Health Screener (BJMHS) to answer questions surrounding the return to custody rate of those linked vs not linked to services.To examine the demographics of inmates screened, types of charges, and length of stay in the criminal justice system, data sets were obtained from Region Ten Community Services Board (R10), ACRJ, Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR), and the Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless (TJACH) after each member of the team completed a training on protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and signing a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). The research team analyzed 60 months of data spanning from July 2015 through June 2020. The data include individuals booked into ACRJ and individuals who received mental health, substance abuse, and intake/access/emergency services from R10. The data from ACRJ, the BJMHS, and R10 were merged to form a single data set compiling relevant information for each individual in ACRJ, such as booking details, BJMHS screener scores, and services received from R10.According to the merged data, of the individuals who took the BJMHS when they were booked into ACRJ, 26% screened in, meaning their BJMHS results indicated they should be referred for further mental health evaluation. The team analyzed the cohort of individuals who screened-in and were available to receive services from R10 following their release from custody. The key findings and outcomes of the study included:•From the ACRJ dataset from 2015 to 2019, 913 individuals screened-in for referral to mental health services. This is 26% of the total inmates who were screened at ACRJ.•Individuals who received services from R10 were more likely to return to custody (19%) within 12 months than screened-in individuals who did not receive these services (11%).","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483772","Community Health Services;Criminal Justice;Mental Health;Severe Mental Illness","Training;Mental health;Object recognition","","2","","5","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most important subtasks is the prison term prediction, which aims to predict the term of the penalty based on the documents of the criminal case. Existing methods consider the problem of the prison term prediction either as a pure text classification problem or a pure text regression problem. The drawback of such approaches is that the accuracy of the prediction is largely affected by the imbalanced data which is due to the complicated distribution of the prison terms. Moreover, most existing methods fail to use the prior legal knowledge or fail to have a better representation of it that may enhance the interpretability of the methods. To address these issues, we construct a heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) with a multi-scale structure for the prison term prediction. Our method first takes sentencing elements as the input, which can be considered as the summaries of the information of the legal documents by legal experts. We then use the graph network as the basic module to represent the sentencing elements and to obtain the relationships between the groups of the sentencing elements. Most importantly, we propose a multi-scale structure, which essentially separates the prison term prediction problem into a classification problem of the time intervals and a regression problem of the accurate term. Since this structure decomposes the original complicated distribution of the prison terms into simple distributions, it effectively promotes the learning ability of the regression models and consequently improves the overall performance of the prediction. We conduct a series of experiments on the dataset of the crime of fraud in mainland China. The results demonstrate that our model can outperform most of the baselines and generate good robustness. In addition, in the classification problem, we find a good legal interpretation for the labels of the intervals when clustering the prison terms. This may enhance the interpretability of our method in the eyes of legal practitioners.","","978-1-6654-9079-5","10.1109/ICIBA56860.2023.10164974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10164974","Prison term prediction;Sentencing element;Multi-scale structure;Heterogeneous graph attention network","Manifolds;Law;Text categorization;Predictive models;Robustness;Fraud;Task analysis","","","","46","IEEE","6 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A particular challenge is the prompt detection of potentially dangerous behavior. In the face of scarce human resources and psychologically limited attention, the use of video live streams is not an optimal solution. An alternative are 3D sensors, which enable the automatic and robust detection of such behavior in detention rooms and other areas such as hospital wards or workshops, while respecting the privacy of the monitored people. In this paper we present our research on this matter, based on realistic data that was acquired in an Austrian prison over 3.5 months. We discuss the recording setup and resulting dataset, and present algorithms for detecting selected behaviors. The experimental results show that these behaviors can be detected reliably, demonstrating that automatic behavior analysis in 3D data is a promising means for supporting the security personnel.","","978-1-83953-109-5","10.1049/cp.2019.1159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9136605","Prison data;Behavior analysis;3D imaging","","","1","","","","8 Jul 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The prediction of the prison term is made by using the conditional probability distribution (CPD) table of the pooling of the two representations. Compared with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques which are often based on deep neural networks and are prevailing in prison term prediction, our model greatly improves the interpretability since the sentencing elements incorporate the prior knowledge of the specific crime and the probability inference framework of the Bayesian Network conforms with the human decision behavior. In addition, our model has a simple architecture so that it can be easily extended.

Digital competence is recognized as a key competence for Lifelong Learning and the importance of social inclusion is highlighted, through the education and training of adults in situations of social vulnerability, as is the case of adult prisoners. With this situation as a reference, the research conducted in a Portuguese prison aimed to produce knowledge about the ways in which digital technologies are used in education and training contexts for adults in situations of social vulnerability and the effects generated in the perceptions of VLE competencies that favor the process of digital and social inclusion. From the empirical point of view, the study used questionnaires, interviews and electronic platform records of adult prisoners who attended training sessions within the scope of an ongoing project in Portugal. The content analysis of the data collected shows that these trainings are based on pedagogical models of integrated and structured intervention through learning modules, mediated by digital platforms with restricted access. The study identified advantages in attending hybrid training courses, with a distance component, such as breaking geographic and time barriers, flexibility of schedules and responsibility in the construction of knowledge, and also contributed to the development of digital skills, communication, interactivity, sharing, autonomy and occupation of time. However, limitations related to lack of internet access, the routines established in prisons, and demotivation were also identified. Digital and social inclusion is only truly possible if there is joint work for successful social reintegration.","2327-1884","978-1-6654-6133-7","10.1109/CiSt56084.2023.10409878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10409878","digital technologies;e-learning;lifelong learning;prisons;inclusion","Training;Schedules;Electronic learning;Digital divide;Statistics;Task analysis;Sustainable development","","1","","49","IEEE","5 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past decade, research teams in Charlottesville, Virginia, have studied data from the region to better understand the nature and extent of the individuals in the criminal justice system who suffer from severe mental illnesses (Boland et al., 2019). The work presented here extends this prior research by enlarging the study population to cover a longer time period, by characterizing the dynamic paths individuals follow through various periods of incarceration, mental health services, homelessness, and probation/supervision, and by incorporating geocoding to explore whether proximity to treatment centers has an impact on linkage to mental health services.Under an approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol, the research team partnered with multiple local criminal justice agencies and community service providers (CSPs) to share data. These agencies interact through the Albemarle-Charlottesville Evidence Based Decision Making (EBDM) Policy Team, where regular monthly meetings are held to discuss issues in the criminal justice system. The research team analyzed data across 48 months from July 2015 to June 2019. These data comprise 8,332 individuals booked into Albemarle/Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ), 13,340 individuals who received Region Ten Community Services Board (R10) mental health or substance abuse services, 2,117 individuals in a locally maintained database of homeless individuals, and 4,345 individuals who received services from Offender Aid and Restoration (OAR), which supervises individuals on local probation. Of the individuals booked into ACRJ, 18 percent “screened in” for referral for mental health services according to the Brief Jail Mental Health Screener (BJMHS). Key findings and outcomes of this study include:•Of the 8,332 individuals booked into ACRJ, 5,499 individuals (67%;) were administered the BJMHS.•Of those 5,499 individuals administered the BJMHS, 1,534 screened in for referral to mental health services, which is 28%; of individuals who received the screener and 18%; of all individuals at ACRJ.These findings support the results of prior research with greater statistical confidence. New findings include:•Individuals who associate their current legal trouble with drugs and alcohol have a 12%; higher screening-in rate than those who do not.•63%; of individuals in ACRJ who screened in and were available to be treated once released ultimately were linked to R10 services.In previous years, BJMHS results showed that there were nearly three times as many people with severe mental illness in jail than previously estimated by the state, and that linkage to mental health services could be improved. These findings led to the development of the Therapeutic Docket, an alternative to the standard judicial process for individuals with severe mental illness (Jefferson Area Community Corrections, 2018). New findings continue to help members of the Thomas Jefferson Area Community Criminal Justice Board and the EBDM Policy Team gain insight into the needs of the region’s mentally ill inmate population, ultimately leading to more evidence-based decision-making regarding the treatment of these individuals within and beyond their periods of incarceration.","","978-1-7281-7145-6","10.1109/SIEDS49339.2020.9106666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106666","Criminal justice;evidence-based decision making;mental illness;homelessness;community health services","Couplings;Drugs;Protocols;Law;Hospitals;Sociology;Decision making","","1","","4","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning (ML) algorithms are commonly used for quantitatively predicting recidivism by assessing a criminal defendant's likelihood of committing a crime thus, guiding decisions and imposing choices for criminal justice officers in managing the criminal population. Beyond the prediction adequacy of these algorithms, an important issue is whether they are capable of making fair decisions. It has been stated that attributes such as gender, race, age, ethnicity, and unemployment appear to affect the fair decision-making of ML systems upon recidivism. In this paper, we study the recidivism predictions obtained by several supervised ML algorithms over a dataset that has been extracted from a Greek female prison data record. The main points addressed by the current contribution concern the study of the resulting recidivism predictions from the perspective of fairness assessment that is related to certain data attributes such as age at exiting the first imprisonment, and employment status at the moment of the first imprisonment. To accomplish that task, several criteria are applied to analyze the ML-based predictions in terms of statistical analysis.","","979-8-3503-0950-8","10.1109/IRASET60544.2024.10548202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10548202","Recidivism prediction;supervised machine learning;fair predictions;fairness criteria","Machine learning algorithms;Statistical analysis;Economic indicators;Employment;Decision making;Machine learning;Prediction algorithms","","","","22","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple statistical records of prisons in India clearly show safety risk for officers on surveillance duty and hence the need to develop a model to cater to this problem arises. An optimistic solution to this problem is to develop a model which can monitor prisons, is user friendly and can be dynamically controlled. This paper discusses an automated surveillance system designed to keep a watch on prisoners and has the capability to mark their attendance through streaming portal. The model has a 74% working efficiency and the run-time is approximately 4 hours. The prototype features visual capturing, effective communication between machine and operator, transfer of visuals and exchange of data and commands using camera, screens, image processing and various protocols such as TCP and FTP. Thus, the model is not only efficient but also has all features that an optimistic solution should have.","","979-8-3503-9663-8","10.1109/ICCES57224.2023.10192882","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192882","Patrol robot;Prison security;Real-time visuals;Keypad controlled;Live-Streaming;Prison Surveillance","Visualization;Law enforcement;Surveillance;Prototypes;Streaming media;Software;Real-time systems","","","","15","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It contrasts the actuarial risk assessment instrument (ARAI) in the Commonwealth of Virginia to the statutory and judicial guidance in Denmark. Both are used as frameworks to identify and classify offenders eligible for diversion to alternative sanctions to imprisonment. By contrasting the sentencing frameworks, the paper articulates and defends the view that actuarial risk assessment as introduced in Virginia challenges a fundamental quality of modern penal justice of recognizing the moral personality of individuals subjected to criminal sentencing. The paper also shows that sentencing judges in Virginia, despite the unambiguously aggregate language of the ARAI, are provided some space to construct sentencing as a more concrete and individualized analysis, relying on the discretionary character of the instrument. Yet, from this discretionary construction flows not only that sentencers are released from the formal legal structures but also that sentencing judges are subjected to the enforcement mechanisms of the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission, outside the scope of judicial review.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgm001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8158257","sentencing;risk;comparative;actuarial;alternatives to imprisonment;fundamental rights","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

HEI allows inmates who meet certain qualifications, including stable residency, employment, and nonviolent offenses, to serve their sentence from their residence rather than in jail. Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ) maintained a restricted capacity for HEI, primarily extending this opportunity to frequent offenders who met the qualifications above (Dornfeld et al., 2023). At the advent of COVID-19, ACRJ increased their capacity and use of HEI to reduce the number of occupants in the jail and, as a result, mitigate contagion risk (Kumer, 2023). Following the expansion of the HEI program, (Dornfeld et al., 2023) discovered that HEI participants had lower reoffense rates than jail-sentenced counterparts who committed similar crimes. Currently, HEI participants are determined from information gleaned from their files or by court order (Kumer, 2023). To streamline this selection process and increase the participation of inmates benefitting from HEI, factors were investigated that correlate with HEI’s success. This research will assist jail administration in identifying candidates who will gain the most from HEI and recommend those offenders to the program.The methods consist of quantitative analysis of booking data acquired from ACRJ along with insight and guidance from contacts at Region Ten Community Services, an organization dedicated to working with those affected by mental illnesses, substance abuse, and/or developmental disabilities. Additionally, Offender and Aid Restoration- Jefferson Area Community Corrections (OAR-JACC) provided a meaningful understanding of the project. The quantitative analysis focuses on factors that may correlate with HEI violations and changes in recidivism rates including criminal history, current charge, mental health, employment, and gender.Factors were identified and analyzed that increase the likelihood of an inmate successfully completing their HEI sentence without violation, using the improved stability provided by HEI to prevent recidivism. These factors formulate sentencing recommendations for ACRJ’s decision-making process.","2994-3531","979-8-3503-8514-4","10.1109/SIEDS61124.2024.10534739","BD; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534739","","COVID-19;Statistical analysis;Pandemics;Employment;Organizations;Mental health;Stability analysis","","","","13","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Overcrowding hinders ACRJ's ability to effectively serve its role in the criminal justice system and the community. This paper identifies the sources of ACRJ overcrowding through analysis of the regional criminal justice system. To gain a basic understanding of the local criminal justice system, the project team conducted extensive interviews with key stakeholders. The information acquired during these interviews supported the development of a detailed process model of the system. This model identified decision points in the system that affect the drivers of jail population - the number of offenders incarcerated and the length of their confinement. The static process model was incorporated in a discrete-event simulation capturing jail-population dynamics. The simulation identified bottlenecks in the local system and components with the greatest leverage to reduce overcrowding. The study concluded that ACRJ should focus its efforts on reducing the volume of offenders at arrest, the decision to set bond, and probation. The project laid the foundation for future research into the selection and implementation of long-term solutions to overcrowding.","","978-1-4244-2365-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2008.4559701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559701","","Analytical models;Systems engineering and theory;Personnel;Safety;Costs;Design engineering;USA Councils;Information analysis;Cities and towns;Discrete event simulation","","","","7","IEEE","15 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An expert noted that the number of suicides at the particular jail was ‘high’ and implied the county should have been on notice that inmates were not being monitored sufficiently. The appels court noted that the expert had not made any statistical comparison of the suicide rate for the jail in question either to national data for the general population or to that of other jails. This failure to use a control group should have rendered the expert's testimony inadmissible. A recent publication of the Bureau of Justice Statistics recommends an alternative definition of suicide rates, which would reduce the current measure of prisoner suicide rates by a factor of 10. A more careful definition of the rate of suicides shows that this alternative measure is inappropriate.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgl008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157701","admissibility of expert testimony;control or comparison group;Daubert criteria;exposure measurement;suicide rate","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Model-driven engineering could be used to determine how applications might run on different platforms, if platform schemas could be matched. However, schema matching typically relies on linguistic and structural similarities, and cloud schema terms diverge so much that such matching is impossible. To address this challenge, we introduce Prison Break: a novel, semi-automated and generic schema matching process. Prison Break solves the divergent vocabulary problem by using web search results as a similarity metric, thus incorporating domain knowledge without constructing a dictionary, lexicon or thesaurus. We tested Prison Break by matching schemas from two major cloud providers: Windows Azure and Google Application Engine. We determined that Prison Break helps solve the vendor lock-in problem by reducing the manual efforts required to map complex correspondences between cloud schemas. This brings us one step closer to automatic model migration across cloud platforms.","2326-6937","978-1-4799-6152-8","10.1109/MESOCA.2014.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976609","Cloud Computing;Vendor Lock-in;Schema Matching;Prison Break","Pragmatics;Google;Computational modeling;Search engines;Measurement;Semantics;Industries","","6","","45","IEEE","6 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Carefully selected individuals are allowed to serve their sentences within the boundaries of an approved location. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local courts and ACRJ adjusted sentencing and incarceration practices to reduce jail occupancy and limit the spread of coronavirus (N. Goodloe, personal communication, September 12, 2022). We wish to explore whether the increased use of HEI affected the return to custody (RTC) at ACRJ.These methods consist of comprehensive, quantitative analysis of booking data provided by ACRJ, in conjunction with continued insight and guidance from Region Ten Community Services (locally known as ""R10"", a provider of mental health resources), Offender and Aid Restoration- Jefferson Area Community Corrections (OAR-JACC) and the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless (BRACH). This paper presents results of ACRJ inmate outcomes within two areas of focus: HEI sentences pre- vs. post-COVID and HEI vs. non-HEI individuals during and since the onset of COVID. In addition to this analysis, we have collaborated with key community stakeholders to better understand the state of the Albemarle-Charlottesville criminal justice system as it recovers from the pandemic.We found that prior to the onset of the pandemic, HEI was reserved for frequent offenders who typically were serving felony charges. After the beginning of the pandemic, ACRJ began placing individuals on HEI who were more representative of the jail population as a whole in terms of prior criminal history and the mix of misdemeanor and felony offenders. We also demonstrated that individuals on HEI are incarcerated for significantly extended periods for comparable offenses than those who serve their sentence in ACRJ, as individuals in jail can get days off of their sentence for good behavior, while HEI participants are ineligible for such time credits. Finally, our analysis of RTC rates at ACRJ shows that HEI results in lower RTC rates than traditional jail sentences, pre- and post-COVID, and when split between misdemeanor and felony offenses. This analysis provides strong evidence for the efficacy of HEI as an alternative to incarceration in our local community, which may give an example for other jurisdictions to adopt or expand HEI usage in the future.","","979-8-3503-0064-2","10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10137861","","COVID-19;Pandemics;Statistical analysis;Sociology;Mental health;Behavioral sciences;Stakeholders","","","","10","IEEE","31 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

American citizens constitute five percent of the global population, but 20% of the world's inmates [5]. Those suffering from mental illnesses are disproportionately affected. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Justice, 64% of inmates in local jails have a history of mental health problems, and 60% are actively experiencing symptoms [2]. To lower the number of Americans behind bars, effective mental health treatment needs to be provided to those in need within the criminal justice system. This project, supported by the Jefferson Area Community Criminal Justice Board, is the continuation of a decade of research into the intersection between mental illness and incarceration in the Central Virginia. The primary goal was to evaluate the efficacy of the Brief Jail Mental Health Screener (BJMHS) used by the region's two jails to determine whether an inmate needs further mental health evaluation following their release. Data was obtained from both jails: the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ) and the Central Virginia Regional Jail (CVRJ), as well as two community programs that provide services to former inmates, Offender's Aid and Restoration (OAR) and Region Ten Community Services (R10). The BJMHS was found to predominantly identify people who had already received treatment. The screener's effectiveness was also found to vary by the location it was given and by the recipient's demographics: Females tended to make up a statistically significantly larger proportion of the screened-in population than expected, and black individuals a smaller proportion. When people took the screener multiple times at different locations (ACRJ, CVRJ, or OAR) and were changing their answers to therapeutic questions, they were more likely to acknowledge they were previously hospitalized for mental health treatment at OAR than they were at either jail. Additionally, of the cohort of inmates screening in multiple times at ACRJ, it was found that as their number of arrests increased, so did the proportion of the group that screened in and group that matched with R10. The findings of this paper will be used to improve the screener process and ideally increase its ability to correctly identify those who require mental health services.","","978-1-6654-5111-6","10.1109/SIEDS55548.2022.9799360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799360","Mental Health;Criminal Justice;Recidivism;Community Health Services","Sociology;Mental health;History;Statistics;Bars","","2","","5","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By relying upon the offender to initiate a phone call from any location in response to a random alarm, the system can be used with individuals who have irregular work schedules, or who do not maintain a fixed address or phone line. The automatic Virtual Custody system provides remote tracking and monitoring capability on a continuous basis, and has particular immediate application to enhancing security and safety with maximum security prisons, and for career criminals or mentally retarded persons on probation or parole, or awaiting trial.

This study focuses on the Greek prison system, utilizing a dataset from Greek prisons to analyze and mitigate biases in ML-based recidivism predictions. The study primarily investigates the impact of age as a sensitive attribute and employs fairness-aware optimization techniques to reduce disparities in predictive outcomes. By incorporating fairness constraints into the training process, we demonstrate that balancing fairness and accuracy is possible. The results indicate that implementing fairness-aware ML models can significantly reduce bias, particularly against younger offenders, while maintaining acceptable predictive performance.

These interactions can generally be divided into two classes: inter-process communication techniques, which a process supports to provide services to its clients, and injection methods, which allow a process to inject code or data directly into another process' address space. Operating systems support these mechanisms to enable better performance and to provide simple and elegant software development APIs that promote cooperation between processes. Unfortunately, process interaction channels introduce problems at the end-host that are related to malware containment and the attribution of malicious actions. In particular, host-based security systems rely on process isolation to detect and contain malware. However, interaction mechanisms allow malware to manipulate a trusted process to carry out malicious actions on its behalf. In this case, existing security products will typically either ignore the actions or mistakenly attribute them to the trusted process. For example, a host-based security tool might be configured to deny untrusted processes from accessing the network, but malware could circumvent this policy by abusing a (trusted) web browser to get access to the Internet. In short, an effective host-based security solution must monitor and take into account interactions between processes. In this paper, we present Prison, a system that tracks process interactions and prevents malware from leveraging benign programs to fulfill its malicious intent. To this end, an operating system kernel extension monitors the various system services that enable processes to interact, and the system analyzes the calls to determine whether or not the interaction should be allowed. Prison can be deployed as an online system for tracking and containing malicious process interactions to effectively mitigate the threat of malware. The system can also be used as a dynamic analysis tool to aid an analyst in understanding a malware sample's effect on its environment.","","978-1-4799-8937-9","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336344","prison;windows;malware containment;inter-process communication","Malware;Kernel;Internet;Monitoring;Browsers","","2","","21","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Community Criminal Justice Board (CCJB) would like to make evidence-based decisions, but doing so requires analysis that existing data systems do not support. Evidence-based decision making, enabled through the data integration effort described in this paper, can lead to a safer and more cost-effective criminal justice system in the Charlottesville community. This paper discusses several implementation issues within the Charlottesville justice system and the integration of extracts from existing databases into a single database that can support evidence-based decision making. The two major challenges in designing and implementing a functional analysis database are 1) lack of a universal identifier to track offenders throughout the criminal justice system and 2) absence of essential data fields necessary to answer important program related questions. The paper includes discussion of a detailed architecture of a proposed system through which data can be extracted from various databases associated with the Albemarle-Charlottesville criminal justice system. This will demonstrate how, with the use of a universal identifier, these data can be aggregated from the various databases and used for evidence-based decision making in the criminal justice system.","","978-1-4673-5663-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2013.6549498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549498","","Databases;Decision making;Communities;Educational institutions;Data integration;Data collection","","1","","10","IEEE","1 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Review of such systems documents widespread, material deficiencies in validity, integrity, and internal security, undermining Liberty, Human Rights and democratic institutions. Underlying research is based on data mining, system analysis, Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] requests, court actions, State Ombudsman, Judiciary Ombudsman and media reports. The Central Election Committee stated in response to FOIA request that the Shin-Bet validated and certified its systems, but the Shin-Bet flatly denied such statement. The Ministry of Justice purportedly implemented the E-signature Act (2001) using “detached” e-signatures, while public access to e-signature data is universally denied, in fact, no valid e-signatures have been implemented, permanently rendering all government legal and judicial records - “ddrafts”. Invalid, insecure IT systems were also implement by the Ministry of Justice in the Debtors' and Detainees' (administrative) Courts. Judges have been repeatedly caught issuing invalid, deceitful judicial records, while the Prison Service routinely admits persons to prison based on false and misleading electronic judicial records. Ministry of Treasury and the Knesset IT systems show critical flaws as well. The establishment of a new Cyber Authority in the Prime Minister's office prompted an unprecedented protest by the security establishment. The UN High Commissioner of Human Rights' Universal Periodic Report on Israel (2018) summed - “ ... serious deterioration in integrity of law and justice agencies as a consequence of the implementation of e-government systems ... the validity and integrity of any legal and judicial records of Israel should be deemed dubious at best.” Cyber security experts and cyber activists, should assume a central civic duty in the safeguard of Human Rights, civil society and democratic institutions in the Post-Truth Era.","","978-1-5386-7001-9","10.1109/ICGS3.2019.8688318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688318","election;courts;prisons;human rights;democratic institutions;deep state","","","2","","30","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The prison size and constant energy use results in excessive energy consumptions, which implies that a focus on such sites is necessary. Most authorities rather focus on the security aspects of prison estates than their energy efficiency, and this is transferred naturally to all members of the prison community, i.e. staff and their families, prisoners and their families and wider community. In this context, the European Sustainable Energy Award for Prisons (E-seaP) is an Intelligent Energy Europe project that deals with the sustainable energy behavior of prison sites in 8 European regions. The main goal is to devise an assessment framework for energy sustainability in prisons using a holistic approach, which takes into consideration not only the building energy management but also the provision for education and training and the wider community impact. This paper presents the adopted assessment framework along with a comparison of energy consumption in 17 prison sites in Europe. The assessment procedure may be adapted for use also in other types of public buildings.","","978-1-4799-4660-0","10.1109/EEEIC.2014.6835861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835861","Public buildings;energy sustainability;energy consumption","Buildings;Energy efficiency;Energy consumption;Training;Europe","","","","12","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional researches on text analysis are generally based on special feature selection and ontology model generation or require legal experts to provide external knowledge. All these methods require a lot of time and labor costs. Therefore, in this paper, we use textual data such as judgment reports creatively to perform prison term prediction without external legal knowledge. We propose a framework that combines value-based rules and a fuzzy text to predict the target prison term. The procedure in our framework includes information extraction, term fuzzification, and document vector regression. We carry out experiments with real-world judgment reports and compare our model's performance with those of ten traditional classification and regression models and two deep learning models. The results show that our model achieves competitive results compared with other models as evaluated by the RMSE and R-squared metrics. Finally, we implement a prototype system with a user-friendly GUI that can be used to predict prison terms according to the legal text inputted by the user.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.2020.06.017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122650","judgment content understanding;pre-trained model;fuzzification;content representation vectors","Predictive models;Feature extraction;Law;Natural language processing;Text analysis","","8","","","","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Walls can prevent escape, by providing both delay and deterrence. However, without any reliable form of associated detection system then interception can only be fortuitous. A paper study of the types of walls used by European Prison Services was undertaken for the Prison Service in August 1993. Simultaneously, work was being pursued on the redesign of walls and wall top devices for the highest category prisons in England. Both threads of work amalgamated in an evaluation programme that included Government scientists, engineers, Prison Officials and UK industry. Several samples of wall top devices and height adjustments were evaluated to learn the cost effectiveness of delay. Meanwhile, work was progressing on the development and evaluation of detection systems for mounting on wall tops. An earlier development between Government and industry had produced a system that had good detection performance, a low false alarm rate but was not used operationally due to cost considerations. This paper will review the work to date concentrating on the evaluation of both the wall top devices and the detection system. It will address some strengths and weaknesses and will also look at some operational considerations.","","0-7803-2627-X","10.1109/CCST.1995.524728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=524728","","Costs;Information security;Delay effects;Europe;Government;Welding;Detectors;Yarn;Intrusion detection;Circuits","","","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Disciplinary- “the way that architecture defines, creates, distributes, and applies the knowledge within its domain of influence”-is increasingly central to the discussions about the present and future direction of the field. Architectural knowledge is diverse and complex, drawing from a range of fields that influence how building or environment is imagined, designed, described, constructed, and sold and how it performs, once built. The study of the prison built environment is a subject in its own right meeting ground for a number of design guidelines. There is sense in which the prison built environment can arise naturally from the activity that the architects uniquely design. The knowledge of prison architecture is strictly an outcome of particular methods, their epistemological assumptions, and institutional mechanisms that facilitate knowledge production. Architectures of control have been considered to direct and/or prohibit certain types of behaviors within a given space. Generating the built environment, the environment which deliver the situation for human interaction, lures on numerous disciplines, together with architecture and law. The paper will investigate the role of architecture in the design of prisons in order to understand how we could develop a project for a prison that is a place for both punishment and rehabilitation with the possible disciplinary design approaches aimed at designing a new jail typology considering safety, security & surveillance. The effectiveness of a prison is not given only by the efficiency of the justice system in force, but also by the articulation of spaces and by the quality of the architecture. The contradiction of the prison is revealed by its need to respond to two opposing demands: punishment and reintegration. The aim of this paper is to sketch a view of how architecture regulates behavior into the nature of prison architecture. To investigate how architectures of control physically prevent or direct a certain type of behavior along with regulating user behavior through the psychological effects of the surrounding built environments.","","978-1-7281-7016-9","10.1109/ICRITO48877.2020.9198035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9198035","Built environment;juvenile;correctional facility;technological security","Security;Planning;Computer architecture;Safety;Buildings;Surveillance;Psychology","","","","19","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Berry","Yorktown High School, Arlington, VA",2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),"13 Jan 2022","2021","","","4323","4326","Are stay-at-home orders effective during a global pandemic? Although stay-at-home orders should help to slow the spread of contagious diseases (like COVID-19) by reducing person-to-person contact outside a household, these orders are only effective if people actually stay at home. This study uses data on the mobility of (anonymized) smartphones within states before and after the enactment of stay-at-home orders to understand the effects of stay-at-home orders on mobility. The dataset contains over ten million observations on the movements of smartphones across all states within the US, which allows for an analysis of compliance with stay-at-home orders without worrying about the potential for self-reporting biases. By using a quasi-experimental method, this study overcomes biases that can come from comparing pre and post policy trends (due to unmeasured differences across states). The results from a difference-in-difference analysis suggest that stay-at-home orders are associated with a 4.6% increase in the percent of smartphones that remained at home during the late spring of 2020 across the US. Although there is a statistically significant difference across states with and without stay-at-home orders, it is important to note that the average percent of smartphones that remained at home was 40% in stay-at-home states compared to 36% in states without stay-at-home orders. The results also show that penalties (jail time and fines) had no significant effect on compliance with stay-at-home orders (considering all states with such orders), while compliance with stay at home orders in Republican controlled states was 5.3% lower than in Democratic controlled states. Further, states with higher population densities had the highest percent of smartphones that remained at home after stay-at-home orders went into effect (at 45%). Overall, the results in this paper suggest that stay-at-home orders had a small but significant impact on mobility, while also suggesting that studies of individual behaviors and choices will be necessary to understand when and why people may be more or less willing to shelter at home during a global pandemic.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671457","COVID-19;Stay at Home Orders;Mobility;Smartphone;Population Density;Politics;Diff-in-Diff","COVID-19;Pandemics;Conferences;Sociology;Big Data;Market research;Statistics","","","","5","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No.00CH37083),"6 Aug 2002","2000","","","100","106","It is widely accepted that a single barrier or a series of barriers can protect a secure site from attack. Although the presence of a barrier may deter an attack, in many cases its most important function is to delay an attack. A barrier is considered effective if it can delay an attacker for a period longer than it takes a response force to respond to the attack. At present, there are varying views between organisations as to the definition of a high security barrier. For example, in the UK the three Prison Services typically protect their most secure perimeters with a wall and a weldmesh fence topped with barbed coil, whereas other secure sites in the UK protect their assets using only palisade or chainlink fencing. Often, by taking into account the history of an organisation, the local culture or the specific threats to a site, these differences can be explained. In an effort to identify those elements of a barrier that make it effective, attack trials have been carried out on a number of barrier configurations. Many of these trials have examined the delay factor introduced when a barrier is used on its own while others have considered the effect of a barrier when used in combination with an intruder detection system or a topping. The paper revisits the basic philosophy behind barriers, presents an overview of the various types of barriers available and discusses their effectiveness when used in isolation or in combination with detection systems and toppings. It is not the intention of the paper to define the ultimate barrier but it is hoped that it may stimulate both thought and discussion.","","0-7803-5965-8","10.1109/CCST.2000.891174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=891174","","Protection;Security;Humans;Animals;Delay effects;Vegetation;Rivers;Welding;Coils;History","","","","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In some states, intelligent algorithms are already being used for this purpose, which, for example, tell the judge the probability of the offender's recidivism. These calculations by a system are then incorporated into the final sentence. Because trust in the administration of justice is of great importance to a society and because tragic consequences can occur for the person concerned if the algorithm makes a wrong assessment, a large number of factors have to be analyzed for the use of such systems. In the present paper, the critical aspects, which have been addressed in the scientific debate so far, are presented in a bundled way.

However, being relegated to a solely online presence has had a major impact on the mental health of users since the onset of the pandemic. The present study aims to identify depressed Twitter users by analyzing their tweets. We propose a deep learning model which stacks a bidirectional LSTM layer along with a CatBoost Algorithm layer to classify tweets and detect depression. The results show that the proposed model outperforms standard machine learning approaches to classification and that there was a definite rise in depression since the beginning of the pandemic.

"The need for a new model of trust in spectrum and the case for spectrum jails","K. Woyach; A.

The major result of this work is that trust can be guaranteed at certification time regardless of the technical solution for finding spectrum holes. Then, performance can improve as technology gets better. This paper is the policy-oriented case for why a new model of trust is needed in spectrum and why spectrum jails are a good starting point for implementing this new trust model. Whereas earlier work developed the mathematical theory assuming a stand-alone enforcement system, this paper shows that spectrum jails can actually be implemented through databases. The database, instead of directing exactly where and when the secondary can transmit, will control the opportunity for the secondary to find spectrum holes. The secondary can then use whatever technical means it desires to recover spectrum holes, understanding that it will no longer be allowed to do so if it causes interference. Interestingly, our results show that the database should gate access to all bands, including unlicensed and exclusively licensed bands. Normally, all devices have access to the ISM bands, and those certified to have access to the licensed bands have permission to use these bands. However, to actually deter harmful interference, the databases must have the power to disable access to these other bands as well. The result is a system that operates as a spectrum tribunal, except run by robots at a fast time scale and a very low cost. It can also adapt its infrastructure to the local situation, and easily evolve as technology changes.","","978-1-4799-2661-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2014.6817826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6817826","","Databases;TV;Resource management;Regulators;Interference;FCC;Runtime","","3","","81","IEEE","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is very important for organizational managers to make efforts and take measures to enhance cooperative behavior. Although there seem to be many ways to constantly elicit cooperative behavior, the punishment is one of the most effective measures for enhancing cooperation. This study focused on the effects of penalty and probability of punishment on the cooperation, and getting insight into how punishment strategy should be used to get rid of social dilemmas and enhance cooperation. This study conducted two simulation experiments to find the optimal penal regulations condition that can suppress violations (defective behavior) in a 2-person Prisoner's dilemma situation. The effects of probability of punishment and penalty on the cooperative behavior were identified with the interactive effect of both experimental factors. The defect (no-cooperative behavior) decreased when the punishment penalty was heavy and the probability of the defect revealing was low than when the punishment penalty was light and the probability of the defect revealing was high.","","978-1-4673-2259-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6318369","Prionor's dilemma;cooperation;defect;punishment model;violation-based accident","Accidents;Computational modeling;Organizations;Mathematical model;Probability;Educational institutions;Analytical models","","","","5","","4 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a low-complexity near-optimal signal detection algorithm using the conjugate gradient (CG) method for uplink multi-user large-scale MIMO systems, which can avoid the complicated matrix inversion required by linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) signal detection algorithm. We also provide the convergence proof of the proposed scheme to guarantee its usability in practice. The analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can reduce the computational complexity by about one order of magnitude. The simulation results of the bit error rate performance verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recently proposed Neumann series approximation algorithm, and achieves the near-optimal performance of the classical MMSE algorithm by using only a small number of iterations.","","978-1-4799-5832-0","10.1109/ICCS.2014.7024849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024849","","Vectors;Signal detection;Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;MIMO;Algorithm design and analysis;Signal processing algorithms","","40","2","25","IEEE","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In terms of purpose, game has two types, which is serious game and non-serious game. As learning media, serious games need to have ability to motivate its player in order to play the game until the end so the player can finish the game while understanding learning materials given in the game. Therefore, the quality of serious game should be measured, like any other software. When it comes to measure serious games, previous models can't do the job well since all of them have no way to measure the game's content, especially to measure the content that can improve player's motivation. This paper proposes a new game measurement metric to measure the game quality factors, especially to measure serious game contents that can motivate its players.

In the proposed MRAS observer, the reference model is the measured rotor current, which compared to the estimation of the rotor current obtained from measured stator voltages and currents. A proportional-integral (PI) control adjusts the rotational rotor angle, driving the error between the measured and estimated rotor currents to zero. A 50kW DFIM prototype system is built to verify the theoretical analysis. Through variable speed tracking control in motoring mode and decoupled active/ reactive power control in generating mode for simulation and laboratory experimental study, even if the magnitude of rotor current is very low, closing to zero, the estimation of rotational speed and rotor position at different speed and power condition can still track the actual value.

Recommender systems can help provide ratings, compare with other user data, use personal transaction history, use current events, or combine the above methods. Currently, computer science experts are constantly trying to improve recommender systems. In 2017 a new method emerged that uses transformers as one of the deep learning models. The combination of recommender systems and transformers can process extensive data, create different weights for each input data, and process data without sequentially allowing parallel processing and reducing training time significantly. Many papers in various countries are continuously trying to improve this methodology.

Therefore, this paper propose a high-precision target identification method for image sequences based on elliptical mark. The proposed approach adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy to identify elliptical mark based on pixel-level detection of Canny method and sub-pixel level identification of Zernike moments, which combines a series of constraint condition methods, thinning method and the least square fitting (LSF). In the process of coarse strategy, the constraint conditions of recursive segmentation method, morphological methods and shape feature are used to remove non-edge points caused by Canny identification. For the fine strategy, the reliable and accurate sub-pixel level edge points are identified by the thinning method and Zernike moments, and sub-pixel center position of elliptical mark are obtained by LSF method. Both simulation experiment and real experiment demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain high precision and reliability results of edge information and center position at a sub-pixel level, and its results are closer to the value by comparing the other two methods in simulation experiment.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8517497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8517497","Close-range videogrammetry;elliptical target;sub-pixel identification;Zernike moments","Image edge detection;Fitting;Mathematical model;Reliability;Image sequences;Shape;Transforms","","3","","13","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide such compensation during charging, it is necessary that PHEVs incorporate bidirectional chargers. Among different types of bidirectional chargers, the DC voltage controller is unable to compensate voltage. Alternatively, the chargers with active power controllers regulate active power as well as reactive power independently, which is effective and convenient.

This paper aims to recognize the retail product recognition algorithm based on the YOLOv7 model in terms of intra-class variations, with the sub-categories of brand and size. We used two schemes of the dataset to compare recognition performance between them. Firstly, the YOLOv7 is applied in the two schemes of the dataset that is annotated with the subordinate category to detect the brand as meta category. Secondly, the proposed method is applied by adding the object size classification into the YOLOv7 model where the square area of the bounding box was calculated to classify the product according to size. Confidence score and square area are used to verify the object and to obtain the product size, which represents sub-category of the product. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves higher recall compared to baseline object detection.","","979-8-3503-2095-4","10.1109/ICCoSITE57641.2023.10127785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10127785","deep-learning;intra-class variations;object recognition;retail products;transfer-learning","Computer science;Machine learning algorithms;Automation;Transfer learning;Object detection;Computer architecture;Information technology","","1","","20","IEEE","23 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, analyzing forex becomes more difficult because candles in one broker cannot be validated by candles in another. Many specific candlestick patterns are difficult to generate for all brokers, so traders' chances of winning will be reduced. Some previous studies have focused on how to identify candlestick patterns and profit from certain candle chart patterns. However, they fail to consider the fact that certain patterns only appear under specific circumstances. In addition, previous researchers typically employ just one broker. This study contributes by taking a unique stance on FX trading by seeking to ascertain what would happen if a single candlestick pattern analysis were to be applied to other brokers who employ other types of candles as well as investigating whether traders can still win in the Forex market despite the challenges they confront. The EURUSD data is gathered from three local brokers in Indonesia. Twelve bullish and bearish candlestick patterns are applied to be analyzed and measured using net profit and validated using t-test statistics. As a result, the difference in the candle causes the difference in the appearance of the candle on the three brokers. Despite the variation between brokers, traders can still manage to make a profit using a single candlestick pattern for one-day trades. The Opening of White Marubozu candles can help traders in making significant profits for all brokers. Whilst for traders in specific brokers, the Closing Black Marubozu and Opening Black Marubozu candle patterns are beneficial.","","978-1-6654-7581-5","10.1109/ICVEE57061.2022.9930395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930395","forex;profitability;candlesticks;brokers","Electrical engineering;Education;Pattern analysis","","","","14","IEEE","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indonesia requires fishing vessels larger than 30 gross tons to use a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Another way to detect fisheries is through Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. To compare VMS and VIIRS data, an R package, “LLFI” (Led Light Fisheries Identifier) was created. This package provides several R-functions that can calculate the location of VMS using vessels at the overpass time of the VIIRS satellite. An MPA near the Natuna archipelago was chosen as the research area. VMS and VIIRS data for the entire year of 2018 were obtained for this Region of Interest. The R function “vms2viirs” calculated activity for small purse seine fisheries all through the ROI and for bouke ami fisheries in the southwestern part of the ROI. The R Function “vms2viirsanalysis” created three buffers around detected fishing vessels by the VIIRS satellite and linked the closest found vessels from the VMS dataset. The amount of identified vessels for Class C was significantly higher than those for class A and B. Approximately 10% of all detected led lights could be identified with a shipping number from the VMS data set. Only around 8% of identified vessels could be found inside MPA and around 3% could be found in a No Take Zone. Paths of identified vessels that some vessels did cross MPA's and No Take Zones. It can be concluded that the LLFI package is working successfully.","","978-1-6654-1464-7","10.1109/AGERS51788.2020.9452785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9452785","Led Light Fisheries;MPA;Vessel Monitoring;VIIRS;VMS","Meters;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Merging;Tools;Radiometry;Light emitting diodes","","","","19","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data from the satellite usually have lower accuracy than other expensive methods e.g. drone, aerial view, etc. However, the data from satellite have wide range area and sufficient enough for modeling a land use. The accuracy assessment, therefore, becomes a vital task to ensure the model from the satellite imagery meets the minimum requirement. Validating the classification result by comparing to the real location or by other higher resolution images is needed. The paper proposed additional validation by comparing the classification result by another result in different date through the cross-tabulation method. Two satellite imageries in the same year were processed before classification to get the land-use and land-cover classification. Comparing two land-use classified images gave the accuracy statistics using cross-tabulation. The kappa statistic and accuracy showed the classification performance of 0.7592 that similar to the sampling-based accuracy assessment (0.75390).

The results show that temporal differential coherence can detect phase variations similar to water level by constantly returning high values even when there is an offset, while cosine similarity yields low scores. Within an urban environment, this approach finds point scatterers corresponding to water level changes in or near water, such as permanent floating objects, bridges, and buildings adjacent to water, where the highest differential coherence value was acquired from a permanent floating restaurant in open water.","2153-7003","979-8-3503-6032-5","10.1109/IGARSS53475.2024.10641328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10641328","InSAR;phase similarity;point scatterers;temporal coherence;water levels","Water;Measurement;Urban areas;Time series analysis;Coherence;Radar;Radar scattering","","","","22","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the majority of research on surrogate modeling has been concentrated on secondary reservoir development processes such as water or gas flooding, with limited focus on surrogate modeling for tertiary oil recovery techniques like polymer flooding. In this paper, we emphasize the utilization of deep modeling techniques and introduce a deep encoder-decoder neural network to establish a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamic mapping surrogate model for uncertainty parameters associated with polymer flooding. Specifically, this model maps uncertain grid permeability parameters to reservoir state variables such as pressure, saturation, and polymer concentration. The model employs an encoder network to extract high-dimensional coarse features of input parameters, followed by a decoder network to refine these features to obtain the final model outputs. Experimental results from applying this model to the dynamic prediction of a two-dimensional synthetic polymer flooding model show improved prediction accuracy compared to two existing surrogate models, while simultaneously reducing computational time for reservoir simulators, thus maintaining prediction precision.","","979-8-3503-8086-6","10.1109/NTCI60157.2023.10403659","National Key R & D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0708700); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:22CX03002A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10403659","Surrogate model;polymer-flooding reservoir;ConvNeXt block;deep neural network;dynamic pre-diction","Training;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Reservoirs;Numerical models;Polymers;Floods","","","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, formula definition is often considered correct after tested with only one or few inputs. This may be fine with simple formula, but for more complex ones, more testings should be performed, in order to prevent solution that riddled with errors. However, writing a formula test case in spreadsheet software is not a simple task, mainly because there is no standard way to do that. In this paper, a simple spreadsheet test case application is proposed. User can define a formula, with many input variants, along with expected results. After that, application will generate a spreadsheet document, with all the needed contents for testing, along with test result. That way, user may re-check the formula and make necessary modifications (then run the test, again). Using this method, a formula can be tested first, with many input as needed, before it put in real document.

In recent years, research pertaining to the discipline of building damage assessment (BDA), which seeks to study the effect of damage on structures, has grown substantially. This bibliometric study seeks to determine the state of the art in the subject of Building Damage Assessment Using Deep Learning by examining several papers. The method used (Donthu et al., 202) divides the steps of bibliometric analysis into four parts: identifying the field of research to be analyzed, identifying the methods used in bibliometric analysis, collecting research data with similar fields, and executing and analyzing the results of bibliometric analysis on the collected data. In the data collecting and analysis portion (Garza-Reyes, 2015), the identification of data search keywords, the execution of data searches, the enhancement of search results, statistical data processing, and data analysis are carried out. Several research questions pertaining to trends, influences, themes, authors, and other crucial components of doing research in the area of building damage assessment are answered using these techniques. The outcome is the mapping and resolution of all research problems, as well as the acquisition of bibliometric analysis-related data. The provided findings have been mapped into several types of visualization, including network % clustering graphs, overlay graphs, and density graphs, as well as other forms of visualization that will aid researchers in comprehending the study circumstances in the field.

The first two offer more flexibilities but greatly differ in complexities. General-purpose language is probably overkill for a simple data entry application. In order to be useful, domain-specific language should be as close as possible to the problem domain and still open to research. This paper presents Perkedel, a domain-specific programming language designed for data entry. It is inspired by spreadsheet concept and offers user interface definitions that resemble a paper-based data entry form. Spreadsheet is one of the most popular programming systems that has been around us for almost four decades and we argue that easy user interface definition is important. This results in writing source code for a data entry application that looks nothing like ordinary source code. This speeds up the development time, too. One of our respondents spent only five minutes to a develop a simple data entry application, compared to the fastest development time of 32 minutes using a generalpurpose language, for similar application. That way, we hope that Perkedel may add a little perk to data entry developer's life using this data entry language.","","978-1-5386-0784-8","10.1109/CYBERNETICSCOM.2017.8311688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8311688","programming language;domain-specific programming language;spreadsheet;data entry","Device-to-device communication","","","","10","IEEE","12 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is one of the main threats on the internet today, so a method needed to detect malware. Malware detection techniques are categorized into static methods and dynamic methods. Both of these techniques still have weaknesses, so machine learning is used to overcome the weaknesses of the two techniques. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network that is usually used to detect and classify malware in image data. However, in some classification tests with certain datasets, CNN still cannot work optimally. Therefore, a model development needed to improve the performance of CNN in doing classification. This thesis proposes a malware classification method using CNN using feature extraction from the high-order Markov Chain transition probability model as input for knowledge transfer. The purpose of developing this algorithm is to provide better classification results compared to conventional CNN methods. Various scenarios were carried out to get the best performance comparison results. The best performance was obtained when the model was run with the Markov transition probability order 1 dataset with 94% accuracy, 95% precision, 95% recall, and 95% f1-score.","","978-1-6654-5122-2","10.1109/ICWT55831.2022.9935479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9935479","Malware;CNN;classification;Markov transition probability","Wireless communication;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Machine learning;Markov processes;Feature extraction;Telematics","","","","11","IEEE","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That's what happened to a man named Jeffrey B. when his GPS-equipped ankle bracelet went berserk. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had strapped a tracking anklet on Jeffrey for good reason. He had pleaded guilty to 26 counts of peeping into windows and video recording young women while they were undressing. After three years in prison, Jeffrey was released. Local county officials decided, however, that because he had broken a previous five-year probation order, they would attach a second GPS monitor, which they controlled. He then had to live with a tracking device on each ankle. Having two anklets, though inconvenient, ultimately helped Jeffrey. Although the county anklet was squawking about a violation, the state anklet was silent. Suspicious county parole officers had Jeffrey arrested, but given the inconsistency, the district attorney quickly dismissed the charge.

The fingerprints were extracted from antenna signals using Welch's classical short-term PSD estimator. To obtain relevant fingerprints background noise reduction was performed through spectral subtraction and separation of signals from different cellphones was achieved by k-means clustering. The resulting cellphone specific signals strengths provided relevant fingerprints for a final classification by the Mahalanobis distance. The validation performed in a four-story prison building with over 100 localization cells showed high performance yielding a localization error smaller than 1.8m for the 2G, 3G and 4G communication standards in 70% of all measurements.","2471-917X","978-1-7281-1788-1","10.1109/IPIN.2019.8911752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911752","Cellphone indoor localization;fingerprinting;signal separation;morphological filtering;Mahalanobis distance","Fingerprint recognition;Antennas;Feature extraction;Signal processing algorithms;Buildings;3G mobile communication","","1","","29","IEEE","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimental ethics is an approach to evaluate expectations humans put into the morality of digital agents. With this work we present a personalized abstraction of the “Trolley Problem” evaluated in a driving simulator. The aim of the study was to assess drivers' individual attitudes in ethical decisions and derive common knowledge about how to solve such situations. In contrast to previous work, the study at hand looks at the problem from a holistic point of view, including uncertainty and accident risk (presented to subjects as their probability to survive). Furthermore, subjective scales and semi-structured interviews to determine subjects' justifications for ethical decisions complemented the setting. Our results (n=40) suggest that most drivers want their vehicles to act in an utilitarian way and opt for the more severe collision — even when their own probability to survive is substantially low. In addition, age and size of the injured party have a significant effect on the results. Qualitative data (interviews) indicate that the justification, in particular for decisions with the same outcome, strongly differs as most people have embodied their own moral concepts.","","978-1-5090-4804-5","10.1109/IVS.2017.7995749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995749","","Ethics;Accidents;Vehicles;Safety;Roads;Uncertainty;Interviews","","12","","14","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We do this by introducing a `singing' sanction that forces devices to burn energy while they sit in jail. Through this exploration, we see a number of effects coming out: a homeband (which may be an unlicensed band) is required to present an alternative band to legally transmit in when it is difficult to operate legally in the cognitive band. Also, when the primary is very rarely active, it is practically impossible to deter cheating, so alternate policy decisions must be made for these cases. Finally, it is possible to create a singing plus jail sanction that is sufficient to deter bad behavior for all types of devices in all types of situations. But in order to enforce against everyone, while keeping overhead low, the rate of wrongful convictions must be kept small.","","978-1-4577-0178-8","10.1109/DYSPAN.2011.5936233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5936233","","Sensors;Interference;Performance evaluation;Cognitive radio;Humans;Law","","9","","34","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, a result, a significant portion of the inmate population at correctional facilities consists of individuals with serious mental illness. In Charlottesville, VA and surrounding counties, individuals suffering from serious mental illness often depend on local community service providers (CSPs) for treatment after their release from custody, but limited interagency coordination impedes access to treatment. To better understand the characteristics of the population of incarcerated individuals with serious mental illness, data spanning a 30month period from July 2015 to December 2017 were obtained through research partnerships with criminal justice agencies and CSPs in the Charlottesville area. In order to evaluate who might benefit from mental health services, this paper characterizes the population of inmates who met screening criteria for further mental health evaluation relative to those who did not. In the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ) booking data, 5,284 unique individuals were identified, of which 3,064 (48%) were screened for serious mental illness. Of those screened, 32% met the screening criteria for further mental health evaluation. For individuals who met the screening criteria, 21% were linked to a local community service provider for further mental health services. Key findings of this study include: · individuals who met the screening criteria for serious mental illness spent a more time in jail during the study period than those who did not meet the criteria. · individuals who stayed more than 30 days for any given booking event were more likely to have met the criteria for serious mental illness, · individuals who returned to custody due to probation violations were more likely to have met the criteria for serious mental illness, · individuals who were returned to custody most frequently and spent the most time in jail were more likely to meet the criteria for serious mental illness. The paper also analyzes the linkages between the criminal justice system and these individuals who require further mental health evaluation and services. These findings help agencies and community stakeholders develop a better understanding of relationships and interactions and establish best practices for enhancing public safety while addressing the needs of individuals suffering from mental illness.","","978-1-7281-0998-5","10.1109/SIEDS.2019.8735652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735652","","Sociology;Statistics;Diseases;Psychiatry;Couplings;Measurement;Merging","","3","","7","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of punishment imposed on the offender has undergone several changes over the centuries, related to culture, politics, and to the evolution of the human thought. For centuries, tiny closed spaces have been adapted for the offenders' detention, without ever thinking to create an ad hoc functional distribution of spaces. The issue of the design of prisons has often been a reason of debate, and it is still an open field of discussion. From a legal point of view, in recent years there has been a rethinking of the problem. From a social point of view, detention should be seen as a time for change and transformation of the offender into a rehabilitated subject, and the EU is forcing the Countries to make important steps ahead. But, to achieve this goal, we all as a high level cultural society need a change in the way of thinking and approaching the problem and adequate structures, to support individuals by offering them the opportunity, “which in civil life they did not have or have not been able to exploit”. The Smart Cities “revolution” could represent the right opportunity to introduce a change of perspective and technical design thinking approach also in this kind of buildings. In this work, we describe a preliminary step of an emblematic case study of a recent prison building, which has many common characteristics to most Italian prison buildings.

This paper identifies two main Information Security technologies: 1) Public key infrastructure (PKI) and 2) Biometrics that hold a lot of promise in a healthcare context. The key contribution of this paper is to propose a novel multi-layered HIS framework based on a combination of PKI, Smartcard and Biometrics technologies. We argue that this new HIS framework could assist healthcare institutions to provide a truly secure infrastructure for the electronic transmission of clinical data in the future. This paper also makes a case for the creation of a new nodal HIS body because existing information security bodies like the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams are for general-purpose organizations and not specifically suited for the healthcare sector.","","0-7803-7667-6","10.1109/ITAB.2003.1222486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1222486","","Medical services;Information security;Paramagnetic resonance;Biometrics;Public key;Electronic medical prescriptions;Mathematical model;Knowledge engineering;Impedance;Robustness","","19","1","19","IEEE","18 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the utilities are able to take advantage of this new technology in the form of load reduction, reliability, and automations of the utility's grid. With the advent of Automated Meter Infrastructure (AMI), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Digital Relays, Engineering and Analysis software (EA), Power Quality meters (PQ) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), utilities can receive more information about the power system than has been available in the past. However, with most utilities the integration of all the information available has not become a reality. This may be due to time or the cost of each piece of infrastructure and the implementation of integrating them into a single network of information. The purpose of this paper is to present a method for evaluating a fully automated electric grid in real time and finding potential problem areas or weak points within the electric grid by using the game theory principles of decision trees and ""The Prisoner's Dilemma"" to evaluate the best possible actions to implement within the electric grid to avoid potential problems before they happen. The process uses the output of an EA that is using real time information from the grid and calculating information such as voltage drops, current, load flow, transformers, substations, sectionalizing and switching. The algorithm allows for each utility to define their acceptable grid operating limits and this information is used by the algorithm to analyze the output of the EA. Output from the segments in the EA that are found to be outside the utility's defined grid operating limits are then sent to the part of the algorithm that uses the game theory principles to evaluate the information and look at the possible solutions and tradeoffs affecting the electric grid if those solutions are implemented. This part of the algorithm then picks the best possible solution to implement within the electric grid to avoid a potential outage, system failure or reliability issue.","2153-3636","978-1-61284-056-7","10.1109/REPCON.2011.5756714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756714","","Software;Game theory;Smart grids;Decision trees;Uncertainty","","8","","3","IEEE","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patrol robot is a comprehensive system with environmental awareness, route planning, dynamic decision making, behavior decision making and so on [1]. The existing patrols are mainly inefficient manual patrols and it is a viable solution to make patrol robots achieve regular, fixed patrol or interrupted patrol in a complex environment. As a technology with excellent human-computer interaction, virtual reality can be applied to patrol robots and it can improve efficiency and reliability of patrol task.

The US and Western countries are putting pressure on Arab countries to introduce and enforce legislations to improve their intellectual property protection. Copyright laws and international treaties such as TRIPS are being introduced to Arab countries as preconditions to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and get the benefits that come with it. However, the war on terror is negatively affecting the war on software piracy.

It is a coin-size radio transmitter that broadcasts a pulsed signal in the 2.4 gigahertz band to a dozen receivers mounted on floodlight masts and near the sidelines. The receivers relay the pulses to a central computer, which then calculates the ball's exact location. The main goal of this transmitter is to help referees with tough calls, such as when a goalkeeper intercepts a ball on the fly after it has crossed the goal line. In such a case, the system would send a vibratory alert to a special wristwatch worn by the referee, signaling that the ball went over the goal.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2005.1436996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436996","","Radio transmitters;Global Positioning System;Optical transmitters;Circuit testing;Receivers;System testing;Pulse measurements;Space technology;Integrated circuit testing;Radio broadcasting","","4","","","IEEE","13 Jun 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

They discuss the alternatives that such a clipping technique opens up and characterize what they call the clipping problem. This problem consists basically of finding a good clipped answer set (i.e., one which yields improved retrieval performance) among many possible ones.

In the early fifties, when young Chandler entered the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard, chemical science in England and in this country was practically a monopoly of the druggists. Those were the days when the druggists in England were called chemists, and the name has persisted down to the present day. Young Chandler had to leave the Lawrence Scientific School and go to Professor Woehler of Göttingen, in order to study the science of chemistry. Neither Harvard nor any other college in the United States was equipped in those days for training students in chemistry. When Chandler returned in 1857, decorated with a Göttingen Ph. D. degree, nobody seemed anxious to engage his services. He finally found some odd jobs with the oil men of New Bedford, analyzing their whale oil. His old friend, Professor Joy of Union College, needed his assistance in the College laboratory, but the trustees were unwilling to appropriate a salary for an assistant in chemistry after they had appropriated five hundred dollars for a janitor of the chemical laboratory. The young doctor of philosophy took the vacant position of janitor. The privilege of giving scientific assistance to the professor of chemistry attracted him to the position of janitor. Nothing can describe better the state of the Chemical science in this country in those days than this beginning of Chandler's scientific career. Nothing can describe better the latent energy of the young doctor of chemistry than his willingness to start his career as a janitor.","2376-5976","","10.1109/JAIEE.1925.6534559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6534559","","Companies;Chemistry;History;Chemicals;Carbon;Urban areas;Substations","","","","","IEEE","24 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Application of this technique to the software requirements design for the Freedom space station resulted in a complete software specification that described what must be done.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) formed a partnership with a solar hot-water heating manufacturer and a Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, to demonstrate the first federal renewable energy savings performance contract (ESPC) as a solution to the problems mentioned above. A 17,040 sq. ft, solar water heating system was installed at the Phoenix FCI. The system delivered 1,161,803 kWh of heat and generated revenue of $70,025.18 during the period from March 1999 to January 2000. Under the terms of this first federal renewable ESPC, FCI Phoenix obtains all the benefits of solar water heating while transferring the first-cost and performance risks to the Energy Service Company (ESCO-in this case Industrial Solar Technology, or IST). This addressed all of the perceived risks of renewable energy.

In this paper, we propose machine learning based models to predict the legal penalty of criminal cases. Particularly, we focus on drunk driving cases as they are frequent, and the regulations are clear. Unlike western text which words are separated by spaces, words in Chinese text are continuum. In our proposed method, we first use a word segmentation method to separate the Chinese words in text and apply a pre-trained model to convert words into vectors. In the vector space, words with similar meanings have short distance with each other. As the amount of each penalty varies greatly, resulting a data imbalance problem. Therefore, we adapt the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm as a solution. Finally, we apply deep learning-based models, including Bi-GRU and TextCNN to perform penalty prediction, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.In the experimental result, for drunk driving case penalty prediction, our propose SMOTE + TextCNN solution can reach 73.96% of accuracy. If we allow the prediction to be plus or minus one month from the actual, the accuracy is 95.60%. As for the computation time, our proposed method can predict the penalty of 1,524 drunk driving cases per second.","2160-1348","978-1-6654-8832-7","10.1109/ICMLC56445.2022.9941286","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9941286","Natural language processing;Legal penalty prediction;Oversampling;Deep learning;Convolutional neural network;Attention mechanism;Bidirectional gated recurrent unit","Adaptation models;Law;Computational modeling;Natural languages;Machine learning;Predictive models;Logic gates","","","","11","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network emulation enables reproducible evaluation of unmodified real implementations. Software built for distributed systems, such as a large scale peer-to-peer system, requires evaluation scenarios with thousands of communicating nodes. Two approaches for scaling network emulation to such scenario sizes have been proposed in the literature: node virtualization and time visualization. Node visualization allows maximizing the utilization of standard hardware used for emulation experiments. Time visualization enables trading experiment duration for visually increased resources of the hardware. It stands to reason that a combination of those two approaches may increase scalability even further. However, in existing combinations, either node visualization implies relatively high overhead or time virtualization requires modifications of the test subject implementation. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach called time visualized emulation environment (TVEE). It integrates node visualization with low overhead and time virtualization, which is transparent to the execution of test subjects. We introduce visual time based on epochs to enable better dynamic hardware utilization during long lasting experiments. Additionally, a mechanism similar to soft timers ensures an accurate reproduction of network properties in the time visualized emulation. Our evaluations show the accuracy and scalability of time visualized network emulation. Comparing TCP throughput, TVEE outperforms other approaches using an event based visual time by an order of magnitude.","1087-4097","978-0-7695-3159-5","10.1109/PADS.2008.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545320","","Emulation;Visualization;Peer to peer computing;Hardware;Scalability;Testing;Software performance;Protocols;Communication system software;Large-scale systems","","29","","18","IEEE","20 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no reason to believe that the application of satellites to education will not create similar consequences. In this paper, several issues of significance in the wide-spread application and use of satellites in education are discussed, including the implications for education and cultural change; the organizational problems in operating a major satellite-based educational system; financing the activities; and the need to aggregate the market in order to amortize large investments for equipment and production, while maintaining a diversity of educational offerings to satisfy local needs. In one sense, the basic difficulty in applying satellites to education is how to develop and apply techniques that can be highly effective, but which are economical only when applied on a mass basis, to insure that there is enough flexibility and variety so that education can be responsive to local needs and desires. The task is to apply satellites to education in order to improve the quality of education, reduce its cost, increase the availability of educational opportunity, and create possibilities for additional choice, yet do so without creating new problems that outweigh existing ones. This is the challenge to those who are making decisions about applying satellites to education that is raised in this paper.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.1976.4321035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4321035","","","","1","","38","IEEE","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The judgment output may include law articles, charges, prison terms, or combinations. Relevant legal cases with similar backgrounds or events should likewise be considered essential references for judgment, as they play an indispensable role in evaluating the prediction task. However, when applied to Chinese legal data, current methodologies often neglect the specialized preprocessing required for unique semantic attributes of Chinese, which affects their prediction performance. This paper proposes a novel contrastive learning- based model for legal judgment prediction named CLR-LJP to improve prediction performance. According to the legal judgment process in real life, law article prediction is converted as a multi- label classification task that includes both relative law cases and law articles. The CLR-LJP firstly converts fact descriptions, law articles, and charges into vectors by embedding Chinese semantics. Then, contrastive learning is introduced in retrieval training to distinguish the similar content of different label definitions. Finally, the role embedding method is applied to learn the interactions among multiple law articles to predict prison terms. Experiment results indicate that our CLR-LJP model achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, especially in the task of prison term prediction.","2831-3410","979-8-3315-2300-8","10.1109/ISPCE-ASIA64773.2024.10756244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10756244","contrastive learning;retrieval;Chinese semantic;legal judgment prediction","Training;Knowledge engineering;Law;Semantics;Asia;Contrastive learning;Knowledge graphs;Predictive models;Vectors","","","","27","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Other layer which is of similar importance is the Shell. “It is a command language interpreter that takes input from the standard input device and acts as an interface to execute commands”. Restricting shell access to minimal commands gives an extra level of security to the Operating System. If a shell is not restricted, intruder can gain access to the system and is able to execute all the commands. Shell is so powerful that intruder may control the whole system to execute the malicious code.

Analyzing this as a two-player game that could be played Stackelberg or simultaneous, we examine what kinds of primary and secondary rights can be credibly enforced. We show that the primary can trust that it will be protected from too much harmful interference and we show how the regulator can set the ex-post enforcement parameters to do this no matter which secondary user becomes capable of using the band. It is impossible to give a universal guarantee to all secondary users that the primary will never make false reports (“cry wolf”) against them.

One effort in remedying this situation has been the SEMAT Essence specification. Essence consists of a language for modeling Software Engineering (SE) practices and methods and a kernel containing what its authors describe as being elements that are present in every software development project. In practice, it is a method agnostic project management tool for SE Projects. Using the language of the specification, Essence can be used to model any software development method or practice. Thus, the specification can potentially be applied to any software development context, making it a powerful tool. However, due to the manual work and the learning process involved in modeling practices with Essence, its initial adoption can be tasking for development teams. Due to the importance of project management in SE projects, new project management tools such as Essence are valuable, and facilitating their adoption is consequently important. To tackle this issue in the case of Essence, we present a game-based approach to teaching the use Essence. In this paper, we gamify the learning process by means of an innovative board game. The game is empirically validated in a study involving students from the IT faculty of University of Jyvaskyla (n=61). Based on the results, we report the effectiveness of the game-based approach to teaching both Essence and SE project work.","","978-1-5386-1469-3","10.1109/ICE.2018.8436340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8436340","software engineering practices;SEMAT;essence;software engineering methods;project management;serious game;game-based learning","Games;Kernel;Tools;Software engineering;Task analysis;Organizations","","5","","21","IEEE","16 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Enterprise Portals allow for structuring information in a way that resembles the organization of paper copies, i.e. simulating folders and registries and furthermore, provide simple routines for publishing and collaborating. Hence, in general, such kind of information management is not much different from paper management: electronic documents must be uploaded into the Enterprise Portal manually, filed into folders (which have to be created manually, too), tagged and related to other information objects if need be. With this approach information structuring remains subject to the individual user leading to the well-known problems of multiple filing, overlooking relevant information and incomprehensible folder structure. The SEEK!sem project aims at improving such kind of information system by automatically identifying and recommending related information resources to be added to a folder. The recommendations are based on rules, exploiting content and context similarity of information resources. Rules can be created upfront, based on explicitly defined relations between information objects. They can also be machine learned, i.e. the recommender exploits the existing linkage between documents, folders and other objects to learn “relatedness rules”. In either case, potential new connections are inferred by applying the rules in a reasoning step. Recommended new connections are ranked by the sum of the scores of all applied rules - the rule scores, again, can either be provided by experts or machine-learned. The applied rules can serve as an explanation of a recommendation, i.e. they can assist users in understanding why a particular connection is suggested.","","978-1-4673-6412-6","10.1109/ES.2013.6690092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690092","information management;similarity;machine learning;context","Context;Abstracts;Information management;Information services;Ontologies;Portals","","1","","27","IEEE","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To create a security margin for the real world, security definitions often borrow Kerckhoffs, principle, i.e., they assume that the attacker knows the system. However, a strict interpretation of the principle, “only the key is secret,” does not apply to steganography because a public cover would compromise security. In this paper, we study two interpretations of Kerckhoffs’ principle for steganography using a conceptual framework of the steganalyst’s knowledge. The framework connects both interpretations and encompasses other existing notions of knowledge in the literature.

Novel reflection-based attacks are also presented, including the password stealing attack. To mitigate the threats, we analyze these restriction bypassing approaches and find three techniques crucial to these approaches, i.e., double reflection, memory manipulation, and inline hook. We propose a defense mechanism that consists of classloader double checker, ART variable protector, and ART method protector, to prohibit the reflection restriction bypassing.

However, the reliability issues that arise from the immature fabrication process and physical device limitations, i.e., variations and stuck-at-faults (SAF), dramatically prevent its wide application in practice. Specifically, variations make the programmed weights deviate from their expected values. On the other hand, defective mem-ristors cannot even represent the weights effectively. In this work, we propose a variation- and defect-aware framework to improve the reliability of memristor-based NCS while minimizing the inference performance loss. We propose to develop analytical weight models to characterize the non-ideal effects of variations and SAFs, which can then be incorporated into a Bayesian neural network as priori and constraint. We then convert the reliability improvement to the neural network training for optimal weights that can accommodate variations and defects across the chips, which does not require computation-intensive retraining or cost-expensive testing. Extensive experimental results with the proposed framework confirm its effective capability of improving the reliability of NCS, while significantly mitigating the inference accuracy degradation under even severe variations and SAFs.","1558-2434","978-1-6654-4507-8","10.1109/ICCAD51958.2021.9643468","NSFC(grant numbers:62034007); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9643468","","Training;Degradation;Neuromorphic engineering;Computer network reliability;Scalability;Neural networks;Memristors","","15","","35","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we proposed a framework for identifying PFZs based on a data-mining approach in the Eastern Indian Ocean. We utilized a spatio-temporal clustering method to identify clusters of zones with data on the largest number of fish catch, which were then integrated with the sea surface temperature (SST) and the sea surface chlorophyll a (SSC) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery. The results of this data integration method were used as training data in the classification process, which was then used to determine PFZs. During the classification process, we utilized the $k$-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification method. The result gave an average accuracy of 87.11%, which showed that the proposed framework can be used effectively to determine PFZs. To validate the framework, we compared its performance against the heuristic rules taken from the knowledge-based expert system model on the SST and chlorophyll a data.

However, the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection, we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3D models for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we construct a synthetic dataset, i.e., Anomaly-ShapeNet, based on ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories, which provides a rich and varied collection of data, enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile, to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization, we propose a self-supervised method, i.e., It-erative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training, we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then, we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a trans-former for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing, the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network, with each iteration's output be-coming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input, our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on our Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on ReaI3D-AD dataset.

To support AIGC metaverse applications within MEC, it is effective to offload computation tasks, particularly those involving neural networks AIGC, from mobile devices to edge clouds. Existing solutions typically assume the availability of a dedicated and powerful edge server for each user, which can handle the entire AIGC service offloading. However, in practical scenarios, the availability of such dedicated and powerful servers may be limited, necessitating the utilization of less capable alternatives. Thus, we propose the delay-aware parallel offloading AIGC framework which partitions multi-modal content and offloads partial diffusion tasks to multiple servers. The proposed scheme accelerates mobile deep vision multi-modal metaverse applications by leveraging parallel offloading for any server provisioning. Our framework integrates recurrent region proposal prediction algorithm with delay-aware multi-modal parallel diffusion offloading scheme, optimizing communication and computing resources while minimizing delay in wireless environments. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce delay by 20% compared to conventional algorithms.","2474-9141","979-8-3503-7767-5","10.1109/ICCCWorkshops62562.2024.10693717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10693717","Parallel Offloading;Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC);Region Proposal Prediction;edge computing","Wireless communication;Metaverse;Simulation;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Delays;Partitioning algorithms;Servers;Proposals;Resource management","","2","","10","IEEE","4 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paradigm trains a general model on unlabeled data that can later be used to solve specific downstream tasks. This type of model is costly to train as it requires manipulating long input sequences that can only be handled by powerful centralised servers. Surprisingly, despite many attempts to increase training efficiency through model compression, the effects of truncating input sequence lengths to reduce computation have not been studied. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study of SSL pre-training for different specified sequence lengths and link this to various downstream tasks. We find that training on short sequences can dramatically reduce resource costs while retaining a satisfactory performance for all tasks.

However, a generalizable implicit field often results in an over-smooth texture field, while the SDS method tends to lead to a texture-inconsistent novel view with the input image. In this paper, we introduce a texture-consistent back view synthesis module that could transfer the reference im-age content to the back view through depth and text-guided attention injection. Moreover, to alleviate the color distortion that occurs in the side region, we propose a visibility-aware patch consistency regularization for texture mapping and refinement combined with the synthesized back view texture. With the above techniques, we can achieve high-fidelity and texture-consistent human rendering from a single image.

With this design, beams at different subcarriers can be aligned along different directions in a planned way. Then the received echo signals at different subcarriers will carry targets information in different directions, based on which the targets' angles can be estimated through sophisticatedly designed algorithm. Moreover, we propose a supporting method based on extended array signal estimation, which utilizes the phase changes of different frequency subcarriers within different OFDM symbols to estimate the distance and velocity of dynamic targets. Interestingly, the proposed sensing scheme only needs to transmit and receive the signals once, which can be termed as You Only Listen Once (YOLO).

Assessment and monitoring of speech disorders offer effective and non-invasive opportunities for dif-ferential diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurological disorders. Oral diadochokinesis (oral-DDK) is a widely used test conducted by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to assess speech impairments. Unfortunately, analysis of the oral-DDK tests relies on perceptual judgments by SLPs and are often sub-jective and qualitative, thus limiting their clinical value. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal oral-DDK test analysis system involving automated processing of complementary 1D audio and 2D video signals of both speech and swallowing function. The system aims to automatically generate objective and quantitative measures from the oral-DDK tests to aid early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of neurological disorders. The audio signal analysis component of the proposed system involves a novel multi-scale deep learning network. The video signal analysis component involves tracking mouth and jaw motion during speech tests using our visual landmark tracking software. The proposed system has been evaluated on speech files corresponding to 9 different DDK speech syllables. The experimental results demonstrate promising audio syllable detection performance with an average of 1.6 % count error across different types of oral-DDK speech tasks.

This introduces challenges as Industrial Control Systems such as Programmable Logic Controller in Operational Technology have been traditionally optimized for speed rather than security due to limited computing power. As computations need to be as efficient as possible, security in Operational Technology has yet to be managed as robustly as in Information Technology. Operational Technology communication protocols for securing data transfer, for example, have no or just a few security capabilities, even for basic authentication and encryption. Common security algorithms rely on random numbers. However, Random Number Generator is not usually part of standard functions in Programmable Logic Controllers, the core control component in Industrial Control Systems. In Industrial Control Systems, the Random Number Generator is mostly implemented as a software-based Pseudo Random Number Generator.

Many IT companies have begun developing augmented reality (AR) games due to the great commercial potential in this industry. Certain products may have managed to remain viable in the market, while others were forced to close due to one or two factors. Since the emergence of Pokémon Go, no other game has managed to surpass its unprecedented success. The company responsible for developing Pokémon Go has decided to shut down one of their games due to a lack of consumer interest. The technology of augmented reality (AR) is consistently associated with the concept of immersion. Immersion is a key aspect of the game that allows users to deeply engage and feel fully involved in the experience. This study will employ a quantitative methodology, utilising a questionnaire that will be distributed to and completed by those who have engaged in augmented reality (AR) games. The data will be analysed using Smart PLS to examine the impact of user experience on immersion, which in turn influences intention. After gathering over 200 participants by spreading google form questionnaires and doing data analysis, the findings indicate that only a few aspects of user experience, namely Brand Experience and User Need Experience, have an impact on reasons. Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, was unable to replicate their success with a similar augmented reality game called Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. The initial release occurred on June 21, 2019, and the shutdown took place on December 21, 2021. In the beginning, they shown a profound enthusiasm for the game but were unable to sustain it, much as Pokémon Go. According to Niantic CEO John Hanke, the primary reason for the game's shutdown was its immersion. Immersion has a notable impact on User Confirmation, which in turn has a notable impact on Satisfaction, and Satisfaction has a notable impact on Intention. Moreover, there have been suggestions on the potential consequences for future companies to create augmented reality (AR) games.","","979-8-3503-8965-4","10.1109/ICISS62896.2024.10751184","Bina Nusantara University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10751184","Augmented Reality;Game;Immersion;User Experience","Surveys;Industries;Data analysis;Games;Companies;User experience;Software;Hardware;Internet;Augmented reality","","","","28","IEEE","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Honeypots have been proposed as a solution to detect and analyze new attack types by simulating vulnerable systems and capturing malicious activities. However, the deployment of honeypots introduces unique risks, necessitating a comprehensive threat modeling approach to mitigate potential drawbacks. This paper explores the intersection of threat modeling and honeypot deployment, identifying threats, and proposing effective mitigation strategies. We applied a threat model adapted from a simplified PASTA framework based on risk-centric and proposed mitigation plans such as network segmentation, outbound traffic filtering, resource monitoring, and regular updates. Additionally, we discussed alternative honeypot deployments outside the organization's internal network to avoid arising risks. We found that deploying high-interaction honeypots carries high risks due to a broader attack flow. The novelty of this study lies in adapting the attack-flow approach for honeypot threat modeling, providing a structured method to analyze and mitigate honeypot-specific threats.

Also, for practical concerns, the addressed system is affected by signal-dependent noise (SDN). The bias allocation problem under SDN and related constraints is shown to be non-convex, thus a convex-concave procedure is utilized in this paper for convexification. The joint design problem is also non-convex, and an iterative optimization procedure is adopted, where the decoder is of Wiener filter form.

The expense of ER is the extent of structure of working hours required for each utilization. Determination of ER values only uses data software development projects with simple linear regression analysis. However, most researchers refer to the proposed ER value without questioning or reviewing the ER value. This study evaluates the ER values for software development projects in the business field, namely the Health Surveillance Application. In conducting this research, we need several data on software development projects in the Health Surveillance field from this data. We can find the ER value by analyzing correlation and linear equations. The final results of this study get the benefit of ER 8.0. This price is lower than the quantity suggested by past scientists. Decreasing the ER value can reduce the estimated amount of the effort, then the decrease in estimated business value will reduce the resources needed for software development.

Inspired by the impressive success of deep neural networks in a wide range of application scenarios, we propose a multichannel attentive neural network model, MANN, which learns from previous judgment documents and performs the integrated LJP task in a unified framework. In general, MANN takes the textual description of a criminal case as the input for attention-based neural networks to learn its latent feature representations oriented to the case fact, the defendant persona, and relevant law articles. Moreover, we adopt a two-tier structure to empower attentive sequence encoders to hierarchically model the semantic interactions from different parts of case description at both the word and sentence levels. The experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets of criminal cases in mainland China.

Moreover, the element-driven attention mechanism is incorporated with the hierarchical sequence encoders, to generate crucial representations oriented to the legal constitutive elements at both the word and sentence levels.

However, this leaves open the major problem of how to enforce/incentivize compliance and what the structure of ldquolight-handed"" regulation should be. This paper addresses this question by developing a model for the incentives associated with cheating and for the tradeoffs between different elements of an enforcement structure which will effectively deter cheating.

The United States is among the few nations internationally, that have moved to enact state-level legislation, regarding the microchipping of people in a variety of contexts. This paper provides an overview of nine state laws/bills in the United States of America that have either enacted anti-chipping legislation or have recently proposed bills regarding the enforced chipping of persons. The aim of the paper is to highlight excerpts of legislation, to identify relevant stakeholders the legislation is directed toward and to briefly describe how it may affect their chipping practices. As a final outcome, the paper seeks to broadly compare state legislation, identifying differences in penalties and fines, and to show the complexity of this kind of approach to protecting the rights of citizens against unscrupulous uses of advanced information technologies.","2158-3412","978-1-4244-3455-8","10.1109/ISTAS.2009.5155900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5155900","","Law;Legal factors;Implants;Legislation;Monitoring;Humans;Medical diagnostic imaging;Signal generators;Diseases;Pharmaceutical technology","","15","","23","IEEE","6 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem is that sensitivity is an intermediate metric that is convenient for certification, but is not reflecting the true externalities imposed by inadequate sensing. This mismatch causes overhead: usually an over investment in sensing at the single-radio level and the inability to exploit synergies across multiple radios because the benefit does not show up in the certification metric of sensitivity. Light-handed approaches have the benefit of allowing such flexibility but come with their own overheads. This paper explores this question in some detail to see if criminal-law inspired light-handed approaches can work without imposing more overhead than it is worth.","","978-1-4244-5189-0","10.1109/DYSPAN.2010.5457911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457911","","Certification;Interference;FCC;Bandwidth;Licenses;Frequency;Runtime;Communications Society;Systems engineering and theory;Proposals","","9","","40","IEEE","3 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second study, 439 subjects completed a survey that identified the psychological traits that contribute to an individual's propensity to participate in White Hat, Grey Hat, or Black Hat hacking. Preliminary results suggest that individuals that are White Hat, Grey Hat and Black Hat hackers score high on the Machiavellian and Psychopathy scales. We also found evidence that Gray Hatters oppose authority, Black Hatters score high on the thrill-seeking dimension, and White Hatters, the good guys, tend to be Narcissists.

To understand how people evaluate text similarity, we queried subjects about the level of content similarity and expression similarity of pairs of documents. Using these judgments on similarity as ground truth, we automated evaluation of similarity. Our main application for automatic evaluation of text similarity is copyright infringement detection. United States copyright law protects expression but not any underlying facts and ideas being expressed. Therefore, we focus on recognizing similarity of expression. We envision a scenario where authors present the system with a document and the system replies with documents that share the same expressive characteristics. We hypothesize that, since content and expression are not independent of each other, accurate recognition of expression similarity will also help recognition of content similarity. The experiments presented in this paper evaluate two sets of features, unigrams and style features, with respect to their ability to recognize similarities in content and expression of documents using the ground truth obtained from user experiments. Our results show that, on our data set of short news articles, stylistic features predict similarity of expression more accurately than tf*idf weighted unigrams. While unigrams can identify high-level content similarities between documents about the same people, topic and events, they are less effective than style features in evaluating finer grained content similarities.","","0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265276","","Computer science;Artificial intelligence;Laboratories;Protection;Performance evaluation;Search engines;Feature extraction;Infrared detectors","","6","","23","IEEE","26 Feb 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While recent advancements in natural language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments; and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8% across all datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each component and provide insights into the model’s decision-making process. Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient, consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3496666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750819","Legal judgment prediction;large language models;knowledge integration;multi-hop reasoning","Law;Cognition;Artificial intelligence;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Decision making;Large language models;Transformers;Contrastive learning;Knowledge based systems","","4","","21","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most previous studies either focused on enhancing LJP’s performance while ignoring the issue of confusing charges and law articles, or only used law articles to improve the judgment of confusing verdicts, resulting in the limited model performance. This paper introduces legal charge knowledge as a type of knowledge to enhance the representation of fact descriptions and incorporates it into deep neural networks. We then propose a Knowledge-enriched Multi-Cross Attention Network (KEMCAN) to improve LJP’s performance, and resolve legal cases involving confusing charges and law articles. Specifically, a cross-attention mechanism is proposed to model the relationship between legal charge knowledge and fact description in a unified model.

Drawn from an ongoing research, this paper focuses on the emerging issues relating to the powers of the Parole Board in releasing the prisoners on parole as well as in prescribing the conditions attached to such release. Such issues involve the duties of the Parole Board in maintaining the community safety and minimising the prisoners' risk of reoffending by laying conditions attached to the parole order as well as providing a smooth transition of the prisoners into the community.

In each situation, different people will cooperate or compete with one another in different ways. In this paper, we study the relationship between how people feel about the person they are interacting with (the affective identity of that person) and their level of cooperation in different circumstances. Standard game-theoretic models provide solutions to what self-interested rational agents would do in various situations. However, humans don't respond rationally in many situations, and the decision to cooperate can be strongly influenced by the identities of the interactants. In this study, over 1,000 participants answered a survey about whether they would cooperate in various framings of the Prisoners Dilemma (PD). These framings are based on the shared cultural sentiments in a three dimensional emotion space (Evaluation, Potency and Activity or EPA) about identities measured in existing large scale surveys. We combined 27 such identities with a set of five different payoff matrices, and provide statistical correlates between the sentiments about identities and likelihood of cooperation. We show that the evaluative (E) dimension is a strong predictor of cooperation, and we discuss the other factors including mixing terms. Our results provide a novel alternative view of cooperation in PD as arising simply from culturally shared sentiments about identities, rather than from payoff estimates.","2156-8111","978-1-5386-0563-9","10.1109/ACII.2017.8273572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273572","","Games;Economics;Cultural differences;Control theory;Law enforcement;Computer science;Psychology","","1","","35","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop an understanding of the aesthetic judgment based on the principle of maximum effect for minimum means. We explain how a means–effect relationship can be established between a product and its purpose or effect, and how the product and the effect can be perceived to be minimal and maximal. We also explain how the appreciation of this relationship depends on a set of assumed alternatives for both the product or means and the effect.

Such stories often tell us more about the present than the past. In this paper, we draw from a qualitative research study involving six small Texas communities to learn how community origin stories function for those who tell them, and how we can better understand communication design for those communities. Drawing on narrative theory in technical and professional communication, we find participants used origin stories to 1) market their community to tourists, presenting a cohesive and attractive image, 2) to explain current characteristics of the community, current attitudes, decisions, and even temperaments, and 3) to negotiate present contradictions and conflicts among themselves — specifically the historical injustices related to race and culture as they play out in the current community. We conclude with implications for conducting communication design research and practice in communities. Origin stories can be the starting point for helping communities to understand their decisions about how to project a community image to outsiders; to question received notions about how individuals behave in their communities; and to identify and confront historical injustices so they can begin to address inequities in the present.","2158-1002","979-8-3503-2550-8","10.1109/ProComm57838.2023.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10229292","Civic engagement;community research;narrative inquiry;rural communities","Buildings;Museums;History;Professional communication","","1","","33","IEEE","29 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents the main issues related to the automatic generation of exercises on the Passive transformation, a commonly occurring type of exercises in language textbooks, but also a very complex topic of Portuguese grammar. The paper describes the methods used to produce a large batch of passive-active sentence pairs, where the active sentence was automatically generated from naturally occurring passive sentences, taken from a large-sized, publicly available, corpus. Sentence pairs are ranked by difficulty level. A sample of randomly selected sentence pairs (40 from difficult level, 100 from medium, and 100 from easy level) was manually evaluated by an expert. Results are presented and error analysis is performed.

To solve this problem, the study aims to provide a framework for a decision support system that runs on previous criminal history and the offence records of the suspect.

The drone’s memory card and remote controller, which have flight records, pictures, and videos on them, have important details about the crime and how the drone was used. We gather and examine this material using digital forensics techniques. Investigative personnel will then be able to recognize potential suspects and comprehend the drone’s participation in the crime. Important details, such as the drone’s flight path, the location of the murder scene, and the identities of the people involved, are revealed by the recovered data. This explanatory case study emphasizes the importance of digital forensics in the analysis of drone-related crimes.

For each strategy S1 of player 1 player 2 finds a best response function F2(S1), and vice versa. If the two response functions intersect, the intersection point (S1*, S2*) is a candidate for Nash equilibrium. This method is especially useful when the strategy space of each player is determined by a single variable (discrete or continuous). In the last decade, the concept of quantum games has been developed (hence we distinguish between classical and quantum games). In a quantum game with two players the strategy space of each player is composed of 2 × 2 complex unitary matrices with unit determinant. That is the group SU(2). The corresponding strategy space is characterized by three continuous variables represented by angles: 0 ≤ α ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ β ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. That turns the use of response functions impractical. In the present contribution we suggest a method for alleviating this problem by discretizing the variables as: {αi, βj, θk}, i= 1, 2, ..., I; j = 1, 2, ..., J; k = 1, 2, ... K. This enables the representation of every such triple by a single discrete variable, (αi, βj, θk) → xijk. Thereby, the strategy space is characterized by a single discrete variable taking I × J × K values and the method of response functions is feasible. We use it to show the following two results: 1) A two players quantum game with partially entangled initial state has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. 2) A two player quantum Bayesian game with fully entangled initial state has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.","2157-9563","978-1-4577-2133-5","10.1109/ICNC.2012.6234560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6234560","","Games;Quantum entanglement;Bayesian methods;Nash equilibrium;Vectors","","","","7","IEEE","9 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing studies have considered task dependencies while neglecting the prior dependencies of labels among different tasks. Therefore, how to make better use of the information on the relation dependencies among tasks and labels becomes a crucial issue. To this end, we transform the text classification problem into a node classification framework based on graph reasoning and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) techniques, named GraSCL. Specifically, we first design a graph reasoning network to model the potential dependency structures and facilitate relational learning under various graph topologies. Then, we introduce the SCL method for the LJP task to further leverage the label relation on the graph. To accommodate the node classification settings, we extend the traditional SCL method to novel variants for SCL at the node level, which allows the GraSCL framework to be trained efficiently even with small batches. Furthermore, to recognize the importance of hard negative samples in contrastive learning, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called online hard negative mining (OHNM) to enhance our SCL approach. This technique complements our SCL method and enables us to control the number and complexity of negative samples, leading to further improvements in the model’s performance.

In the region surrounding Charlottesville, VA, these individuals often rely on community service boards for mental health treatment after their release from correctional custody, but limited cross-agency coordination makes receiving this assistance and treatment difficult. To better serve the incarcerated population with serious mental illness and reduce the social and economic burden of re-incarceration, data spanning a 30-month period from July 2015 to December 2017 were obtained through research partnerships with criminal justice agencies and community service boards in the Charlottesville area to track the behavior of individuals with mental illness through every stage of the system. A cohort of individuals with identified serious mental illness from jail data was matched across data from different agencies, and the resulting merged, de-identified data regarding behavior and criminal justice outcomes were analyzed to improve understanding of this system and its service to the population with serious mental illness. 5,584 unique individuals were identified in Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ) booking data, 3,531 were screened for serious mental illness, giving a 63% screening rate, and 1,129 of those screened met the criteria to be referred for serious mental illness, leading to a 32% referral rate of the screened population. Referred individuals were more likely than those not referred or not screened to receive treatment at Region Ten, the local community services provider. Referred individuals were also less likely than those not referred to successfully complete Offender Aid and Restoration probation. These insights help agencies and community stakeholders improve practice in the management of this population.","","978-1-5386-6343-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2018.8374727","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374727","Criminal Justice;Evidence-Based Systems Engineering;Mental Illness;Recidivism","Mental disorders;Sociology;Statistics;Couplings;Hospitals;Tools;Merging","","1","","7","IEEE","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Charlottesville and Albemarle County, as well as in jurisdictions across the country, there is a lack of coordination between the criminal justice system and mental health services, which leads to a gap in fully understanding the tendencies and trends within the inmate population suffering from mental illness. In an effort ameliorate this lack of coordination, Albemarle/Charlottesville seeks to become the second community in the country (behind Camden, NJ) to have data from community mental health service providers and criminal justice agencies analyzed together and the first to do so with a focus on a released jail cohort. The Albemarle/Charlottesville criminal justice system is a leader in evidence-based decision making practices, which aim to improve public safety and reduce jail overcrowding by using data and data-driven analysis in order to determine how to best manage the inmate population suffering from mental illness. This project contributes to the evidence-based practice by investigating treatment linkages and efficacy of treatments for individuals whom the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail has referred for further mental health evaluation and treatment. The project required merging data, covering an 18-month study period from July 2015 through December 2016, held by seven participating agencies, including the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, Charlottesville Police Department, Emergency Communications Center, Region 10 Community Services, Offender Aid and Restoration, Virginia Department of Corrections, and University of Virginia Hospital. By using data from the Brief Jail Mental Health Screener administered to individuals during jail intake, this project tracks the inmates that have been referred for mental health evaluation or treatment in order to identify any patterns or similarities between these individuals as they are diverted from, move through, or exit the jail system. Identifying information was used to merge disparate datasets, with a core dataset containing 3,848 unique inmates, on a secure computer and server. The merged datasets, stripped of personally identifiable information, were used for analysis to answer research questions including characteristic differences between referred and non-referred cohorts, the efficacy of Crisis Intervention Teams, and the effectiveness of treatment on recidivism reduction. Of the 3,848 inmates in the jail data, 2,151 inmates took a brief mental health screener and 23% of screened individuals were referred. Of this referred cohort, there was roughly a 44% treatment linkage rate of receiving mental health, substance abuse, or other services from Region 10. This unique combination of datasets that merges information from multiple sources lays the foundation for future collaborative efforts among the participating agencies and provides a framework for exploring additional research questions beyond the scope of this effort.","","978-1-5386-1848-6","10.1109/SIEDS.2017.7937706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937706","Criminal justice;Evidence-based systems engineering;Mental illness;Public safety;Recidivism","Sociology;Statistics;Couplings;Law enforcement;Hospitals;Stakeholders;Market research","","1","","5","IEEE","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a 2011 study, Bronson reported that 68% of prison inmates with diagnosed SMI returned to custody at least once within 4 years, 8% higher than those without SMI [1]. This issue is especially prevalent in regional jails, where 63% of male inmates and 75% of female inmates in regional jails suffer from symptoms of serious mental illness every year, making immediate assistance to these individuals crucial [2]. In response, a team of University of Virginia (UVA) Systems Engineering students work in collaboration with an array of organizations in the Charlottesville-Albemarle region to identify and provide local jail inmates with the mental health services they need, and produce policy recommendations to improve conditions for individuals with SMI who are prone to exposure to the criminal justice system [3]. The current Capstone team consists of undergraduate UVA students who perform analysis using the data provided by the organizations, enabling the community to make informed decisions. However, these decisions are hindered because, since the data sets from different organizations are not linked with a unique identifier for individuals across the agencies that are responsible for the care and supervision of individuals suffering from SMI. This makes the matching of individuals between data sets difficult. This issue is exacerbated by recidivism, which results in multiple occurrences of similar (or identical) values, complicating typical record matching methods, which often rely on one-to-one matching methods. Moreover, the data include protected personal identifiers (PPI) and HIPPA protected data, which also restricts data sharing among the agencies. Thus, any effort to merge the data must adhere to applicable data security rules and non-disclosure agreements. To resolve these matching issues, we first condensed the reiterations of data within each dataset into one line per individual and included an internal consistency metric that reflects possible changes (i.e. preferred name, address, etc.) that could affect data matching. Then, we developed a matching algorithm using the Record Linkage package on Python that compares two data sets consisting of resident information from Region Ten Community Services (R10) and the Jail Management System (JMS) at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail (ACRJ) [4]. As a result of this process, we identified over 95 additional matches and another 50 uncertain matches that required human spot-checking, which is an improvement of 10% to previous methods of record matching applied to the data set. Such results could have significant results to the Capstone team as well as to other fields of research, especially regarding medical, financial, or other forms of data that deal with changing data over time.","","978-1-6654-5111-6","10.1109/SIEDS55548.2022.9799372","University of Virginia (UVA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799372","","Measurement;Couplings;Data security;Collaboration;Organizations;Mental health;Systems engineering and theory","","1","","9","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we present a novel multiobjective optimization paradigm, robust multiobjective reinforcement learning (RMORL) considering environmental uncertainties, to train a single model that can approximate robust Pareto-optimal policies across the entire preference space. To enhance policy robustness against environmental changes, an environmental disturbance is modeled as an adversarial agent across the entire preference space via incorporating a zero-sum game into a multiobjective Markov decision process (MOMDP). Additionally, we devise an adversarial defense technique against observational perturbations, which ensures that policy variations, perturbed by adversarial attacks on state observations, remain within bounds under any specified preferences. The proposed technique is assessed in five multiobjective environments with continuous action spaces, showcasing its effectiveness through comparisons with competitive baselines, which encompass classical and state-of-the-art schemes.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3397393","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, through Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Young Individual Research(grant numbers:A2084c0156); MTC Individual Research(grant numbers:M22K2c0079); ANR-NRF Joint(grant numbers:NRF2021-NRF-ANR003 HM Science); Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore, through the Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE-T2EP50222-0002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51975311); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10537218","Adversarial machine learning;decision and control;multiobjective optimization;reinforcement learning (RL)","Uncertainty;Optimization;Task analysis;Robustness;Perturbation methods;Noise;Reinforcement learning","","1","","70","IEEE","23 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting strain on correctional facilities nationwide has prompted recent research on the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment during incarceration. The LOCUST Therapeutic Community (TC) at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail in Charlottesville, VA, is one such treatment program. The LOCUST TC aims to rehabilitate inmates by promoting lifestyle changes through behavioral-modification therapy. This paper reports on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the LOCUST TC, as a guide to the design and implementation of program modifications and new programs. We compared the success of a cohort of inmates who participated in the program for thirty days or longer (n=298) against a control cohort of qualified non-participants (n=111). Overall success was defined as the fraction of recidivists in each cohort for the study period. In addition, for the recidivists in TC (n=232) and control (n=96) cohorts, success was measured by days until recidivism. Using randomized block design, we determined the effect of 30 days or more in the LOCUST TC on both recidivism and days until recidivism and determined which cohorts of inmates benefit most from participating in the TC. Program participants recidivated less often and significantly later than non-participants. The TC was most effective for 21 to 25 year olds and 36 to 40 year olds, African Americans, males, those not involved with drug court, and those with no prior TC experience. The results suggest that increasing the LOCUST TC may ultimately lessen jail overcrowding and the net cost of incarceration.","","978-1-4244-7522-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2010.5469690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5469690","","Drugs;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;USA Councils;Capacitive sensors;Medical treatment;Costs;Lead;Alcoholism;Employee welfare","","","","7","IEEE","20 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to the current demand for blockchain application security detection and assessment in all industries, and the insufficient coverage of existing detection technologies such as smart contract detectiontechnology, this paper proposes a blockchain core technology security assessment system model, and studies the relevant detection and assessment key technologies and systems. A security assessment scheme based on a smart contract and consensus mechanism detection scheme is designed. And the underlying blockchain architecture supports the traceability of detection results using super blockchains. Finally, the functionality and performance of the system were tested, and the test results show that the model and solutions proposed in this paper have good feasibility.","1673-5447","","10.23919/JCC.fa.2023-0715.202406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10565799","blockchain security;consensus mechanis;smart contract","Security;Smart contracts;Consensus protocol;Codes;Application security;Syntactics;Standards","","","","","","19 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Identifying the factors that lead to re-offending is critical, and AI can assist in recognizing hidden patterns. Through training on existing databases of previous offenders, AI models can predict potential re-offence in those currently incarcerated. To effectively reduce re-offence rates and eliminate crime, assessing the risk and implementing appropriate countermeasures and rehabilitation programs is essential. We utilize machine learning algorithms for predicting recidivism rates, focusing on achieving the best Accuracy scores for the NIJ dataset (National Institute of Justice). To improve the correctness of our predictions, we conduct separate experiments for each gender and crime group, as they exhibit distinct statistics and characteristics. Additionally, we implement three feature selection methods to reduce the number of features by 45%, resulting in an 11% increase in Accuracy for one data subset with a nominal difference for most subsets. The best average Accuracy for the original dataset was 68%, which is the same after selected features provided by the LightGBM model. The most crucial feature that repeats in most experiments is the age at release, between 18 and 22, which shows young offenders exhibit a higher risk of recidivism. The results show inconsistent differences in gender, location, and type of crime committed. These variations can lead to biased outcomes, hindering the possibility of a universal solution for all situations. Additionally, attaining improved results and a scalable, generalized solution poses a challenge. Similarly, the lack of crucial personal information from data such as mental health, drug abuse, employment, and education results in higher importance factors of indirect causes of recidivism obstructing the determining factors.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-8164-1","10.1109/ICDMW60847.2023.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411645","Recidivism Risk;Re-offense Predication;Criminal Justice;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning","Training;Soft sensors;Mental health;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Data models;Artificial intelligence","","","","20","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The 2006 July 17 Java (Indonesia) tsunami from satellite imagery and numerical modelling: a single or complex source?","H. Hebert; P. -. Burg; R. Binet; F. Lavigne; S. Allgeyer; F. Schindelé",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2012","191","3","1255","1271","The Mw 7.8 2006 July 17 earthquake off the southern coast of Java, Indonesia, has been responsible for a very large tsunami causing more than 700 casualties. The tsunami has been observed on at least 200 km of coastline in the region of Pangandaran (West Java), with run-up heights from 5 to more than 20 m. Such a large tsunami, with respect to the source magnitude, has been attributed to the slow character of the seismic rupture, defining the event as a so-called tsunami earthquake, but it has also been suggested that the largest run-up heights are actually the result of a second local landslide source. Here we test whether a single slow earthquake source can explain the tsunami run-up, using a combination of new detailed data in the region of the largest run-ups and comparison with modelled run-ups for a range of plausible earthquake source models. Using high-resolution satellite imagery (SPOT 5 and Quickbird), the coastal impact of the tsunami is refined in the surroundings of the high-security Permisan prison on Nusa Kambangan island, where 20 m run-up had been recorded directly after the event. These data confirm the extreme inundation lengths close to the prison, and extend the area of maximum impact further along the Nusa Kambangan island (about 20 km of shoreline), where inundation lengths reach several hundreds of metres, suggesting run-up as high as 10–15 m. Tsunami modelling has been conducted in detail for the high run-up Permisan area (Nusa Kambangan) and the PLTU power plant about 25 km eastwards, where run-up reached only 4–6 m and a video recording of the tsunami arrival is available. For the Permisan prison a high-resolution DEM was built from stereoscopic satellite imagery. The regular basin of the PLTU plant was designed using photographs and direct observations. For the earthquake's mechanism, both static (infinite) and finite (kinematic) ruptures are investigated using two published source models. The models account rather well for the sea level variation at PLTU, showing a better agreement in arrival times with the finite rupture, and predict the Permisan area to be one of the regions where tsunami waves would have focussed. However, the earthquake models that match the data at PTLU do not predict that the wave heights at Permisan are an overall maximum, and do not predict there more than 10 m of the 21 observed. Hence, our results confirm that an additional localized tsunami source off Nusa Kambangan island, such as a submarine landslide, may have increased the tsunami impact for the Permisan site. This reinforces the importance for hazard assessment of further mapping and understanding local potential for submarine sliding, as a tsunami source added to usual earthquake sources.","1365-246X","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05666.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8214451","Tsunamis;Subduction zone processes;Submarine landslides;Indian Ocean","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

It is hence important to ensure that their ethical standard aligns with humans’. However, existing jail-breaking efforts show that such alignment could be compromised by well-crafted prompts. In this paper, we disclose a new threat to LLMs alignment when a malicious actor has access to the top-k token predictions at each output position of the model, such as in all open-source LLMs and many commercial LLMs that provide the needed APIs (e.g., some GPT versions). It does not require crafting any prompt. Instead, it leverages the observation that even when an LLM declines a toxic query, the harmful response is concealed deep within the output logits. We can coerce the model to disclose it by forcefully using low-ranked output tokens during auto-regressive output generation, and such forcing is only needed in a very small number of selected output positions. We call it model interrogation. Since our method operates differently from jail-breaking, it has better effectiveness than state-of-the- art jail-breaking techniques (92% versus 62%) and is 10 to 20 times faster. The toxic content elicited by our method is also of better quality. More importantly, it is complementary to jail-breaking, and a synergetic integration of the two exhibits superior performance over individual methods. We also find that with interrogation, harmful content can even be extracted from models customized for coding tasks.","2375-1207","979-8-3503-3130-1","10.1109/SP54263.2024.00208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646642","","Privacy;Ethics;Art;Large language models;Predictive models;Encoding;Security","","2","","76","IEEE","5 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Field trial results using a novel integration of unique millimeterwave Doppler radar for high performance non-obtrusive life sign (breathing and heart beating) monitoring of high suicide risk prisonner in observation cell","A. Gagnon","K&G Spectrum Inc, Québec, Canada",2016 IEEE International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST),"16 Jan 2017","2016","","","1","9","This paper presents the fields results in non-obtrusive life sign monitoring performed using a low emission, compact high frequency Doppler radar, which can detect body movements associated with breathing and the heart beating. Such a system is particularly useful where attaching sensors to the body is undesirable; for example, monitoring detainees in a prison who are at risk of suicide, self-harm, and medical complications due to drugs or alcohol. This method of monitoring can aid greatly in situations where it can be difficult to ascertain a person's status, such as a person who is sleeping under a blanket. While a breathing and cardiac signal is visible in the Doppler radar signal, it can be corrupted by noise and interference by so-called nuisance signals (e.g., movements associated with fans, water flowing from faucets and toilets, door micro-motion, light fixture ballast vibration and other body movements). This work is part of a three-year project that involves four organizations; CSC (end-user), KG Spectrum (radar-based perimeter intrusion detection systems), Carleton-University (bio-medical) and Ottawa-University (signal processing). The final goal is to develop a robust system for detection of attempted suicide events in prisons in time to allow for lifesaving interventions. This has been done in a novel way by installing one high range (75cm) spacial resolution, scanning antenna and high frequency (24.125GHz) radars in prison cells and by processing signals extracted from the radars in real-time. This unique radar architecture allows the usage of novel signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms to locate the subject and removing interference and reliably estimate breathing and heartbeat signals, even when the subject is non-stationary and then to produce an alarm when these signals cannot be observed or significant changes, in breathing pattern or heart rate pattern, representing abnormal behavior have been detected within the observation cell. This research project is performing time, frequency and pattern domain analysis on the radar data and explores signal processing approaches for the robust and accurate detection and estimation of the respiratory with heartbeat rate. Outcome of this research will be useful in mitigating the risks associated with detainees by providing a life sign monitoring approach that can help enable timely responses. Such a system can also find application in smart health homes for monitoring people at risk, such as the elderly or infants, as well as in psychological institution. In addition to presenting the results of filed trial, this paper covers the innovative engineering aspects of using high frequency, high range resolution and high sampling rate as a mean to geo-localize the source of movement within the prison cells, thereby increasing the efficiency of the signal processing eliminating the need to process on overall volume wise integrated Doppler signal. The use of geo-localization provides natural discrimination of source of nuisance, allowing the signal processor focusing on Doppler signal solely produced by the inmate heart beat and breathing responses.","2153-0742","978-1-5090-1072-1","10.1109/CCST.2016.7815682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815682","RADAR;LSMS Life Sign Monitoring System;Biorhythm Radar Signature;Non-Obtrusive Breathing and Heart Beating Life Sign;Contactless Monitoring","Doppler radar;Doppler effect;Monitoring;Radar antennas;Computer architecture;Microprocessors","","2","","12","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A target-barrier is a continuous circular barrier formed around the target. The target-barrier has a dbound constraint that is set depending on applications and needs, where dbound is the minimum distance of the constructed barrier from the target. Target-barrier coverage is very suited for application in defense surveillance, including detection of intrusion from outside and prevention of barrier breaching from inside. For instance, in a jail scenario, sensors can be deployed to enclose a jail with the constraint of dbound to detect the escape of prisoners or unauthorized entry into the jail for rescuing prisoners. We focus on how to minimize the number of members required to construct target-barriers in a distributed manner while satisfying the dbound constraint and minimizing the amount of message exchange required. In performance evaluation, we compare our solution with the solution of related work and the Brute-Force algorithm which can find the minimum number of target-barrier members required. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm delivers satisfactory results in terms of the number of target-barrier members required and the amount of message exchange required.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2751040","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 106-2221-E-032-016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031350","Wireless sensor networks;coverage problem;target-barrier coverage","Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Surveillance;Mobile computing;Mobile communication;Algorithm design and analysis","","44","","34","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Worsened conditions contribute to future unlawful behavior and re-arrest, repeating the cycle. The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) was developed to alleviate this problem by helping prevent people with mental illness from entering the jails in the first place. Through specialized training and other education programs offered to law enforcement officers, CIT aims to improve mental health treatment as well as interactions with the law for those experiencing effects of a mental illness. The CIT program needs to provide evidence that its programs in Charlottesville benefit the community as planned. This project is focused on designing and implementing a data collection and evaluation strategy for the Charlottesville CIT. Using the systems methodology, the authors developed a data collection system that collects information specified as necessary in evaluating the effectiveness of CIT and its programs. The system requires individuals from 6 agencies to submit monthly datasheets to the CIT coordinator.

The proposed framework involves a spatial feature extraction layer consisting of capsule blocks, a temporal feature extraction layer consisting of GRU with attention mechanisms, and an output layer. At the same time, considering the actual demands for recognizing aggressive activities in some specific scenarios like smart prison, we constructed a daily and aggressive activity dataset (DAAD). Moreover, based on the acceleration characteristics of aggressive activity, a threshold-based approach for aggressive activity detection is propounded to meet the needs of high real-time and low computational complexity in prison scenarios. The experiments are performed on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) dataset and the DAAD dataset, and the results verify that the propounded CapsGaNet could effectually improve the recognition accuracy.

Krauss",NA; NA,"Law, Probability and Risk","18 Jan 2018","2014","13","1","91","104","Twenty states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government have adopted sexually violent predator (SVP) Laws, which permit the post-incarceration confinement of persons who: (1) have a previous conviction or charge for a sexual offence; (2) suffer from a mental abnormality; and (3) are likely to engage in future acts of sexual aggression. Although most who are convicted of a sexual offence will not be subject to SVP commitment, a burgeoning body of research indicates that commitment is highly likely once the decision is placed in the hands of the jury. The high rate of commitment suggests that there might be a presumption of dangerousness in these proceedings, possibly stemming from the previous conviction requirement. This potential explanation was tested in the current experiment. Jury-eligible participants (n = 190) were provided with varying degrees of information pertaining to the SVP commitment criteria. Some participants were told only that a person had been referred for an SVP commitment proceeding, whereas others were given information relevant to some or all three of the legal criteria. The rate of commitment did not vary as a function of the information provided. The mere fact that a respondent had been referred for an SVP proceeding was sufficient for a majority of participants to authorize commitment. We then calculated participants’ implicit operationalization of the ‘likely to offend’ criterion. On average, participants require the risk of recidivism to exceed 31% (range 20–40%) to effectuate commitment. These findings raise concerns about whether the constitutionally required due process occurs in SVP commitment proceedings.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgt015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157939","juror decision making;risk assessment;decision thresholds;sex offenders","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Instead, under this new law, parental rights can be terminated if the case meets three criteria: the child is already known to CPS, the parent is currently serving a term of four or more consecutive years, and—crucially—the parent is judged likely to be in prison for a “substantial period of the child's minority.”<superscript>2</superscript> The bill was passed that day.","","9780262382021","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=11003789.pdf&bkn=10982021&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","14 May 2025","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

The system can disconnect from the utility during large events (i.e., faults, voltage collapses), but also may disconnect intentionally when the quality of power from the grid falls below certain standards. CERTS Microgrid concepts have been demonstrated at the Alameda County Santa Rita Jail in California.

For cognitive radios to succeed in reducing the regulatory overhead, this has to change. For us, light-handed regulation means minimizing the mandates to be met at radio certification and relying instead on incentives to deter bad behavior. We put forth a specific technical framework in which the certification mandates are minimal - radios must modulate their transmitted waveform to embed an identity fingerprint, and radios must obey certain go-to-jail commands directed toward their identities. More specifically, the identity is represented by a temporal profile of taboo time slots in which transmission is impossible. The fraction of taboo slots represents the overhead of this approach and determines how reliably harmful interference can be attributed to the culprit(s) responsible. Meanwhile, the fraction of time that innocent radios spend in jail is the overhead for the punishment system. The analysis is carried out in the context of a real-time spectrum market, but is also applicable to opportunistic use.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2009.4804393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4804393","","Cognitive radio;Frequency;Government;Certification;Privatization;Radio broadcasting;TV broadcasting;Law;Legal factors;Safety devices","","14","","15","IEEE","31 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This magnified the need of a more efficient and reliable signal scrambler for a cultured society. Mobile Jammer devices are becoming civilian products rather than electronic warfare devices. With increasing number of Mobile users, the need to disable Mobile phones in specific places, where the ringing of Mobile phone would be disruptive, has increased. These places includes Worship places, lectures Rooms, Hospitals, Concert halls, meeting room, jails and other places where the silence is appreciated. Mobile Jammer can be very effective in Confidential meeting Hall where important information can be leaked from room to outside without knowing to any other person. Jammer can be very effective in jails to break the communication between the prisoners. This paper discusses the design and development of GSM Mobile jammer and aims to present a solution for the problems of complexity and cost, related to jammer designs. Paper also discusses the performances of jammer for various types of signal.","","978-1-4244-5875-2","10.1109/WCSN.2009.5434792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5434792","GSM;Radio Frequency;Antenna;RF Generator;RF Amplifier","Jamming;GSM;Mobile communication;Frequency;Cellular phones;Base stations;Costs;Radiofrequency amplifiers;Power generation;Poles and towers","","13","","13","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Should primaries be considered victims or police?","K. Woyach; A.

We first treat the primary as a victim, to understand the expense of protecting primaries in different situations. In all cases, the overhead can be limited by reducing the rate of wrongful convictions. We then allow the primary to participate in its own protection - ideally, we want the primary to report interference but otherwise operate as though the secondary were not present. However, the primary can report interference when there is none; it can also transmit “gibberish” to claim more than its required transmit time. Because the primary will be affected in some way by secondary presence, it unfortunately has incentive to use these behaviors to kick the secondary out of the band. Crying wolf, an obviously undesirable behavior, is too easily done if reporting is free. So, it must be countered by making reporting interference sufficiently expensive. “Gibberish,” on the other hand, requires more serious thought because it is not easily deterred and may in fact be useful in encouraging compatible subcontracting. Finally, we show that both primary and secondary do better with better coexistence strategies, so the jail system gives natural incentives for better receiver designs, registration in a database, or other approaches for making coexistence simpler.","","978-1-4673-4448-7","10.1109/DYSPAN.2012.6478160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478160","","Interference;Games;Open systems","","5","","22","IEEE","14 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The NIST 800-101 Revision 1 method is used as a guide in conducting the forensic process. Data acquisition was carried out using the Cellebrite UFED 4PC tool, data examination and data analysis were carried out using Oxygen Forensic Detective, FTK Imager and Autopsy. The results of the analysis obtained are then compared to the condition of the iPhone and the scenarios that have been executed. The results of this study indicate that the condition of the iPhone that has been jailbroken greatly affects the findings of digital evidence. WhatsApp digital evidence found on jailed iPhone devices has the same amount as the jailbroken iPhone condition with a digital evidence finding value of 71.42%. Telegram obtains more digital evidence with a digital evidence finding value of 71.42% on a jailbroken iPhone.

SS 10/0,4 kV Airport 1 and 2 have the possibility of supply from two SS 35/10 kV. During usual operation they are supplied from SS 35/10 kV Divulje, and in case of fault or other reasons they are supplied from another source - SS 35/10 kV Kastela. Split Airport also has its own generators. The duration of switching from one to another source depends on time of manual switching of the dispatcher and availability of the operating staff, and is measured in minutes. In order to reduce the outage time to a minimum automation and remote control equipment (remote terminal unit - RTU with PLC functions) was installed to perform the automatic reconfiguration function. IEC 61850 communication standard is used for communication between the two RTUs each installed in one of the 10/0,4 kV SS. The main function of the automatic network reconfiguration system is power supply loss detection (by voltage or fault indicator, SCADA, or combination of these and switch status) which triggers the Automatic Network Reconfiguration (ANR) algorithm that performs all the necessary switching operations for supply restoration without the influence of dispatcher. The applied technical solution serves as a model for supplying exceptionally important and sensitive consumers such as hospitals, courts, jails or to just provide and offer more reliable power supply to all customers.","","978-1-84919-732-8","10.1049/cp.2013.0872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6683475","","","","","","","","16 Dec 2013","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In addition, historical data has been recorded on offenders who have passed through the program, making the program a good candidate for case-based reasoning. Using such reasoning, county officials would like an objective measurement which will predict the success or failure of a candidate offender based on past offender history. The four case-based reasoning algorithms chosen for this prediction are discrete, continuous and distance weighted k-nearest neighbors and a general regression neural network (GRNN).

Empirically committing the first crime at a very young age leads to a much higher rebound rate and the continuation of similar offensive behavior. Accordingly, prioritization must be given for the early assessment of recidivism behavior in first-time offender by law enforcing agencies. Different prison studies suggest that recidivism can be curtailed by early behavioral risk assessment in first-time offenders. Ideally, a psychologist conducts a manual risk assessment using standard psychological assessment tools, which has long been regarded as a standard method for recidivism risk assessment. However, such behavioral examination procedures are usually sluggish and constrained by subjective perceptions. Consequently, this study aims to develop a machine learning-based quantitative risk assessment tool for the recidivism behavioral gradation of first-time offenders. Quantitative gradation and prediction of future recidivism behavior in such offenders are achieved using an ensemble learning model and an advanced machine-learning approach. For the available behavioral data collected from multiple prison locations, simulations were performed, and the experimental results were obtained. It is ascertained that, the proposed three-member and five-member ensemble classifier models lead to 85.47% and 87.72% accuracy respectively in comparison to other standard individual classifiers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3116205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551955","Recidivism;first time offenders;predicting criminal recidivism;quantitative psychology;ensemble learning model","Risk management;Predictive models;Machine learning;Computational modeling;Psychology;Tools;Support vector machines","","7","","46","CCBY","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this problem, we propose to adopt a new search strategy and enhanced orientation based on the traditional Q-learning algorithm, which reduces the possibility of falling into local optimal and speeds up the learning efficiency. The simulation results show that our method can quickly and accurately realize the path planning and fully autonomous navigation of the indoor ground mobile platform. In structured spaces represented by storage centers, unmanned chemical factories and prisons, our method is more suitable for practical application scenarios of the indoor ground mobile platform.","","978-3-8007-5739-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736868","","","","","","","","17 Mar 2022","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

This proposed system for monitoring and recording the inspection procedure, assures high safety and availability of a healthy environment in prisons. The dashboard feature is also provided to allow the end user to capture and track different checkpoints. The primary cause of creating SIG is to enable agents to use it in prisons for the inmates that can detect if they have metal tools, capture serious movements and drugs, and record heart rate. Most policemen will get an advantage from this glove as having all these features in a glove will ease the inspection process as well as it would be safer for them as it will capture every movement of the inmate. Furthermore, to make the gloves secure, when used, the RFID reader is added to verify the inspector's identity at beginning of the duty. On the other hand, all the data of the prisoner will be saved and can be reviewed later by police officers through their dashboards. The Raspberry Pi has been chosen for developing the system prototype because of its versatile features and excellent performance at low costs.","2831-6878","978-1-6654-5474-2","10.1109/ASET56582.2023.10180873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10180873","Safety screening;Wearable device;IoT;Raspberry Pi","Heart rate;Law enforcement;Tracking;Metals;Prototypes;Inspection;Cameras","","","","6","IEEE","20 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The author argues that implementing AI for a smart city should be decided similarly to how cities decide on major infrastructural planning projects. For both, there are social and ethical implications of deployment. A protocol is proposed for smart city AI so that AI can be seen as an ethical and trustworthy city asset rather than an adversary fraught with controversy and bias. This is achieved through participatory AI - the marriage of a fully transparent data architecture, such as the blockchain, and the urban planning practice of participatory planning. The diversity of opinions that participatory AI affords enables cities to facilitate socially responsible AI outcomes.","","978-1-7281-1664-8","10.1109/CSE/EUC.2019.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919542","Responsible AI, AI Bias, Participatory Planning, Blockchain, Smart Cities","Artificial intelligence;Planning;Smart cities;Surveillance;Autonomous agents;Decision making","","8","","18","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To implement EBDM more effectively, local criminal justice authorities—police, jail, pre- and post-trial services, and courts—are working together to use and share data across legacy systems better. One important facet of this effort is to design improved methods for data visualization, analysis, and interpretation. In this effort, we demonstrate how data and analytics are used to assess how well criminal justice system objectives are met and how analysis results can be presented using an advanced data visualization tool. The visualizations displayed using Tableau® contain charts, graphs, and dashboards, that allow an analyst to evaluate EBDM performance measures. These reports were developed using historical data to illustrate how an integrated database can be used to produce reports once the database is implemented. With this in mind, reports are general while envisioning what the new database structure will be. Decision makers within the Charlottesville system now have dashboards that they can use to evaluate program efficiency, and determine how well initiatives are working. Our work also consisted of helping with overall data organization, both in ensuring clean data and efficient data entry. We explored the implementation of 2D barcode scanners to read data electronically in different areas throughout the system. Electronic data entry improves data consistency and efficiency in entering data into the system. Ultimately, correct data entry and clean data will lead to more trustworthy analysis of Charlottesville's criminal justice system.","","978-1-4799-1832-4","10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7116993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116993","Data entry;Evidence based decision making;Integrated database;Visualization","Data visualization;Decision making;Databases;Measurement;Communities;Organizations;Data analysis","","2","","2","IEEE","8 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Approximately $96 billion is lost annually due to electricity theft worldwide. Theft of electrical power is considered an offence known as electricity theft. Energy theft is a common behavior that predates the distribution of electricity. A range of techniques, from the most basic, such as simply connecting to a power line, through the manipulation of computerized electrical meters, are used to steal electricity. Fines and jail are a few of the penalties for the offence. Non- technical losses are those resulting from the theft's impact on the electricity supply. Many methods for identifying electricity theft have been put forth. This paper presents a prototype model which helps the distribution companies (DISCO) that transfers energy from generating stations to consumers to digitalize the present tariff system. It is accomplished by sending the messages to the consumer of their energy consumption and reduce the non-technical losses which occurs mainly due to energy theft by direct hooking from service lines and bypassing the metering system. With the use of a smart energy meter, this model is utilized to automatically determine when and where a theft is occurring by any resident, business, industry, etc. This paper also presents a method to find location of the electricity theft as quickly as possible, thereby allowing the distributors to take necessary measures to rectify the situation and penalize the wrongdoers.","","978-1-6654-8271-4","10.1109/ICECA55336.2022.10009512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10009512","Non-technical losses;metering system. smart energy meter;energy theft;tariff digitalization;GSM;Peer to peercommunication","Meters;Industries;Energy consumption;Power transmission lines;Tariffs;Prototypes;Energy measurement","","1","","17","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary user has to decide to what extent it invokes the services of the regulator, and the secondary user has to decide how to operate in the spectrum band. This paper builds on a mathematical model for light-handed regulation using “spectrum jails” to show that the order of play and amount of commitment matters. A primary that can commit to its strategy before the game is able to increase its equilibrium payoff, even when the secondary best responds to the committed strategy. We compare the ensuing Stackelberg game with the simultaneous primary-secondary game. We also introduce a new concept of partial commitment by which the primary can only commit to a range of strategies using a finite number of bits. We show explicitly that the more the primary commits to, the more it benefits, and that Stackelberg commitment can be understood as a limit of infinite “commitment bits”.","2157-8117","978-1-5090-4096-4","10.1109/ISIT.2017.8006979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8006979","","Games;Interference;Information theory;Nash equilibrium;Pricing;Standards;Regulators","","1","","19","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the acquisition of programming skills is not an easy task. This fact is corroborated by the literature that report alarming failure and dropout rates in CS0 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. On the other hand, forecasts about the demand for software developers indicate exponential growth over the next decade.In this context, reducing the cognitive workload for learners is desirable. For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax. It allows learners to focus their attention on solving the problem algorithmically.There are several tools that provide automated assessment evaluation. Some of these can be used with Web browsers, but very few of them can be integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS). In this workshop, we will discuss two of these systems that are distributed as free software: the Virtual Programming Laboratory (VPL) and the iVProgH/iAssign solutions. They can all be integrated with the Moodle platform.Since VPL demands an extra installation of the jail server (to run students solutions) and works with traditional programming languages, the focus will be over iVProgH/iAssign. The iVProgH/iAssign solution implements the Visual Programming Paradigm. iVProgH is implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, sparing the use of a security environment to separated compilation, as VPL demands.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028445","programming languages;visual programming;introductory programming course;learning;teaching;iVProgH;Moodle","Programming;Visualization;Software;Tools;Education","","","","0","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The video that obtained from the camera is taken as the input. From the video the face of human is extracted and discards other faces. From recent crime investigations it is know that rather than arising of new criminals, the crimes are being conducted by already registered criminals during their parole or coming out from jail after their sentence. In this system a variety of photos related to each criminal is provided in the database. By using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm the content of pictures that is input face, is automatically identified by the software. This approach of identifying image from a whole lot of images is used to understand the criminal from a wide collection of criminal list. Using this software, it is easy to analyze the real details of one culprit through his face photo. Though this system provide a variety of appearance model photos about a criminal and categories them to a common criminal identification number it is very easy to identify the criminal. During analysis, the input photo is given and is cross matched with the training lot of all given photos using ANN and best matched photo with its criminal identification number and other details about the culprit will be displayed. This gives better result for further development and also can be implemented in various real time situations.","","978-1-4673-9939-5","10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755362","Artificial Neural Network (ANN);ICA (Independent Component Analysis);SVM (Support Vector Machine)","Face;Face recognition;Face detection;Artificial neural networks;Image color analysis;Skin","","","","12","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Keynote: Explainable-by-design Deep Learning","P.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. MACHINE and AI justifiably attract the attention and interest not only of the wider scientific community and industry, but also society and policy makers. However, even the most powerful (in terms of accuracy) algorithms such as deep learning (DL) can give a wrong output, which may be fatal. Due to the opaque and cumbersome model structure used by DL, some authors started to talk about a dystopian “black box” society. Despite the success in this area, the way computers learn is still principally different from the way people acquire new knowledge, recognise objects and make decisions. People do not need a huge amount of annotated data. They learn by example, using similarities to previously acquired prototypes, not by using parametric analytical models. Current ML approaches are focused primarily on accuracy and overlook explainability, the semantic meaning of the internal model representation, reasoning and its link with the problem domain. They also overlook the efforts to collect and label training data and rely on assumptions about the data distribution that are often not satisfied. The ability to detect the unseen and unexpected and start learning this new class/es in real time with no or very little supervision is critically important and is something that no currently existing classifier can offer. The challenge is to fill this gap between high level of accuracy and the semantically meaningful solutions. The most efficient algorithms that have fuelled interest towards ML and AI recently are also computationally very hungry - they require specific hardware accelerators such as GPU, huge amounts of labeled data and time. They produce parametrised models with hundreds of millions of coefficients, which are also impossible to interpret or be manipulated by a human. Once trained, such models are inflexible to new knowledge. They cannot dynamically evolve their internal structure to start recognising new classes. They are good only for what they were originally trained for. They also lack robustness, formal guarantees about their behaviour and explanatory and normative transparency. This makes problematic use of such algorithms in high stake complex problems such as aviation, health, bailing from jail, etc. where the clear rationale for a particular decision is very important and the errors are very costly. All these challenges and identified gaps require a dramatic paradigm shift and a radical new approach. In this talk the speaker will present such a new approach towards the next generation of computationally lean ML and AI algorithms that can learn in real-time using normal CPUs on computers, laptops, smartphones or even be implemented on chip that will change dramatically the way these new technologies are being applied. It is explainable-by-design. It focuses on addressing the open research challenge of developing highly efficient, accurate ML algorithms and AI models that are transparent, interpretable, explainable and fair by design. Such systems are able to self-learn lifelong, and continuously improve without the need for complete retraining, can start learning from few training data samples, explore the data space, detect and learn from unseen data patterns, collaborate with humans or other such algorithms seamlessly.","","978-1-6654-0424-2","10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9431114","","Deep learning;Computational modeling;Semantics;Training data;Real-time systems","","","","6","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has universal significance for image capture of surveillance system to recognize moving human bodies, accordingly, it is an imperative to recognize moving human bodies from other moving objects rather than distinguish differences amongst human bodies. In this paper, the frame difference method is employed for image segmentation of moving objects, matching algorithms such as human body shapes, skin colors and postures are studied. By synthesizing information features of human body shape data and skin color data, a matching algorithm for moving human bodies is established. This algorithm is computationally efficient, and can be applied to resource-restricted systems e.g. embedded systems. The experimental results show that this algorithm can accurately segment moving human bodies from complex background, and can greatly reduce the calculation workload, in addition, it needs less storage spaces and has good robustness and accuracy. Therefore this algorithm can be pragmatically applied to video surveillance via automatically controlling lenses towards moving human bodies.","","978-0-7695-3688-0","10.1109/ITCS.2009.182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190219","moving human bodies;matching algorithm;image segmentation","Humans;Video surveillance;Image recognition;Shape;Skin;Monitoring;Image segmentation;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Robustness","","","1","8","IEEE","4 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current systems support individual functions and were not designed for cross-functional analysis. The Charlottesville and Albemarle criminal justice system needs the ability to store and analyze longitudinal data in order to identify appropriate and effective interventions, and support evidence-based decisions. The proposed solution is an integrated database with a SQL back end and a SharePoint front end. The pilot database, developed this year, contains select data fields from the police, the jail, and the city commonwealth attorney's data systems. The long-term goal of this project is the completion of an integrated database including all criminal justice stakeholders in the Thomas Jefferson Area Community Criminal Justice System. A data-sharing system available to all of these agencies will enable many questions to be answered with evidence-based reasoning. For example, some agencies would like to know the average time between arrest and sentencing for a specific crime and how different sentence lengths for similar crimes affect recidivism rates of offenders. Eventually, with all agencies in the criminal justice community included, the usefulness of such a datasharing system extends far beyond these examples. The National Criminal Justice Association (NCJA) aims for the final system to be replicated in other jurisdictions nationwide.","","978-1-4799-4836-9","10.1109/SIEDS.2014.6829924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829924","","Databases;Communities;Cities and towns;Servers;Educational institutions;Standards;Information management","","","","1","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It may be considered a “leading case” on the debate over the criminal responsibility of Service Providers (abbr. SP) for the omission of the duty to monitor the use of the Internet for illicit scopes and to prevent the commission of computer related crimes. The sentence did not recognize the existence of such general duty but sentenced to jail the three managers for the infringement of Italian privacy law. According to Court opinion the three manager did not complain with the duty to acquire the consent of all the individuals before the treatment of their personal data. A duty extended by the Court's decision to the case of the uploading, in GoogleVideo, of a defamatory video even if the treatment of personal data of the victim was made not by Google but by the uploader of the video. The Court bringing out the contents of privacy regulation created, at least, for the all SP, a de facto duty to prevent criminal conducts committed by others. This statement will be discussed underling that the active collaboration of SP with criminal law enforcement agencies is necessary for real security reasons but may be considered a lawful tool in the social control of computer related crime only if pressing limits of proportionality principle are satisfies.","2156-7190","978-1-4244-8150-7","10.1109/INTERNET.2010.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616311","Computer related crimes;Prevention;Criminal Law;Internet Service Providers;Fundamental Rights","","","","","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In public cloud environment, the client moves its data to public cloud server (PCS) and cannot control its remote data. Thus, information security is an important problem in public cloud storage, such as data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In some cases, the client has no ability to check its remote data possession, such as the client is in prison because of committing crime, on the ocean-going vessel, in the battlefield because of the war, and so on. It has to delegate the remote data possession checking task to some proxy. In this paper, we study proxy provable data possession (PPDP). In public clouds, PPDP is a matter of crucial importance when the client cannot perform the remote data possession checking. We study the PPDP system model, the security model, and the design method.

Depending on whether the video images are recorded by static cameras or moving cameras, we initially detect regions that are likely to contain an object by median background subtraction or a deep learning based object proposal method, respectively. Then, the detected regions are classified into UAV or distractors, such as birds, by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. To train this classifier, we use our own dataset comprised of crawled and self-acquired drone images, as well as bird images from a publicly available dataset. We show that, even across a significant domain gap, the resulting classifier can successfully identify UAVs in our target dataset.

However, when these methods are applied to text classification, we usually can not obtain an ideal result. The most important reason is that the semantic relations between words is very important for text categorization, however, the traditional method can not capture it. Sentiment classification, as a special case of text classification, is binary classification (positive or negative). Inspired by the sentiment analysis, we use a novel deep learning-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs)model for automatic security audit of short messages from prisons, which can classify short messages(secure and non-insecure). In this paper, the feature of short messages is extracted by word2vec which captures word order information, and each sentence is mapped to a feature vector. In particular, words with similar meaning are mapped to a similar position in the vector space, and then classified by RNNs. RNNs are now widely used and the network structure of RNNs determines that it can easily process the sequence data. We preprocess short messages, extract typical features from existing security and non-security short messages via word2vec, and classify short messages through RNNs which accept a fixed-sized vector as input and produce a fixed-sized vector as output. The experimental results show that the RNNs model achieves an average 92.7% accuracy which is higher than SVM.","","978-1-5090-4099-5","10.1109/ISCIT.2016.7751626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751626","recurrent neural networks (RNNs);word2vec;short message security audit;deep learning","Security;Feature extraction;Text categorization;Training;Logic gates;Support vector machines;Semantics","","16","1","15","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is crucial to classify violence in surveillance scenarios like in a prison, gymnasium, car parking, and so on. In this work, a novel method is proposed to identify violence in different circumstances. Initially, some frames are selected from each video clip using image subtraction and averaging techniques and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is applied to extract lower level features. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are used for the classification purpose. The system is able to achieve the highest accuracy rate of 86% while using Random Forest classifier. The experimental result on the benchmark dataset shows significant accuracy and an improvement over the previously proposed methods.","","978-1-7281-6040-5","10.1109/EICT48899.2019.9068754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068754","Violence Detection;Video Surveillance;HOG Feature Extraction;Support Vector Machine;Random Forest","Videos;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Testing;Forestry;Training;Surveillance","","13","","12","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As this demand rises, the threat they pose to both privacy and safety also increases. Delivering contraband and unauthorized surveillance are new risks that accompany the growth in this technology. Prisons and other commercial settings where venue managers are concerned about public safety need cost-effective detection solutions in light of their increasingly strained budgets. Hence, there arises a need to design a drone detection system that is low cost, easy to maintain, and without the need for expensive real-time human monitoring and supervision. To this end, this paper presents a low-cost drone detection system, which employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, making use of acoustic features. The Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients (MFCC) derived from audio signatures are fed as features to the CNN, which then predicts the presence of a drone. We compare field test results with an earlier Support Vector Machine (SVM) detection algorithm. Using the CNN yielded a decrease in the false positives and an increase in the correct detection rate. Previous tests showed that the SVM was particularly susceptible to false alarms for lawn equipment and helicopters, which were significantly improved when using the CNN. Also, in order to determine how well such a system compared to human performance and also explore including the end-user in the detection loop, a human performance experiment was conducted. With a sample of 35 participants, the human classification accuracy was 92.47%. These preliminary results clearly indicate that humans are very good at identifying drone's acoustic signatures from other sounds and can augment the CNN's performance.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438533","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438533","","Support vector machines;Privacy;Surveillance;Sensor fusion;Prediction algorithms;Real-time systems;Safety","","3","","19","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In few developed countries, telehealth has become standard medical practice. Over 10,000 peer review papers have been published during past 20 years supporting the clinical effectiveness and cost savings of telehealth. Unfortunately, telehealth has not been implemented widely especially in developing countries yet. In order to identify the resistance and enabling factors for the implementation of telehealth especially in developing countries, a comprehensive study has been done. This includes communication and application technologies, standard and legal issues, cost and business models, as well as user and key player requirements. The study result shows that technology has become an important enabling factor. Some technologies even have fulfilled the critical requirements such as reliability, user friendliness, simplicity, safety, security, cost effectiveness, connectivity and compatibility. However, without solving related legal issues, implementation of an excellence business model as well as user acceptance, telehealth will be difficult to be implemented in developing countries. A telehealth model with considering those resistances and enabling factors has been developed and will be presented in this conference. The model has been tested in some hospitals and clinics in few developing countries. Test result shows that the model is suitable, cost effective and able to improve the health service quality in developing countries. It is hoped that the developed model can be widely implemented in the near future. This will benefit people in rural areas, developing countries, correction facilities (prison and rehabilitation centre), schools, mobile units, disaster areas, and industrial units (mines).","","978-1-4577-1166-4","10.1109/ICICI-BME.2011.6108587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108587","","Business;Law;Medical services;Mobile communication;Biological system modeling;Security","","3","","","IEEE","22 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These devices are a significant threat to security and the monitoring process even inside the prison. The proposed system is very helpful in places where the use of cell phones is hardly permitted. Spying and unauthorized video transmission can be detected and blocked by this suggested design.

Important efforts have been made to develop technological prevention tools, but the proposed solutions are mostly using cumbersome devices, in addition to their lack of generalizability. Nowadays, computer vision methods for real-time video analysis have experienced impressive progress. The recent emergence of RGB-D cameras clearly illustrates the achieved advances by offering new ways for machines to interpret human activity. There was however no significant works on exploiting this evolution, and as a result, CCTV systems used for monitoring suicidal inmates are still greatly depending on human attention and intervention. This paper proposes an intelligent video surveillance system for automated detection of suicide attempts by hanging. The proposed algorithm is able to efficiently model suicidal behavior by exploiting the depth information captured by an RGB-D camera. Activity detection is then performed by classifying visual features characterizing body joint movements. Our method demonstrated a high robustness on a challenging dataset including video sequences where suicide attempts are simulated.","","978-1-78561-400-2","10.1049/ic.2016.0081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267321","suicide detection;video surveillance;RGB-D imaging;human activity recognition;video analysis","","","3","","","","5 Feb 2018","","","IET","IET Conferences"

In Australia it has also been shown that telemedicine can reduce the ""time-to-treatment"" in some cases. The time spent by consultants in travelling to the satellite clinics of a medical center consortium can be greatly reduced following networking the consortium. The rate of growth of telemedicine appears to depend on several factors: (1) the degree of consolidation of the multiple LANs of a participating medical center; (2) the level of computer proficiency of the clinicians involved; (3) the extent of computer entry of patient data at both the remote and medical center sites; and (4) the extent of ""economy of scale"" achievable in sharing leased lines with public and private networks. Video-conferencing is very cost-effective in providing health care for prison and mental institution inmates since patients can be seen without transporting them to an outside clinic. The most important factor limiting the development of telemedicine today is the lack of insurance reimbursement for participating clinicians.","","0-7803-2050-6","10.1109/IEMBS.1994.415298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=415298","","Telemedicine;Costs;Biomedical imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Hospitals;Medical treatment;Medical services;X-rays;Satellite broadcasting;Computer networks","","2","","4","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Targets are tracked throughout the duration of their passage through the environment, providing a complete history of their movement patterns for subsequent interpretation. Such information can then be made available to the security operators in the event that an illegal or abnormal activity is detected. This paper focuses on the requirement for delivering a stream of multiplexed video to a central video monitor station, based on the use of a simplified MPEG video encoding. This approach utilises the target detection process to identify sub-images in the image data. These rectangular image fragments are JPEG encoded and transmitted on demand to the central monitor station for display, where they are superimposed onto an image of the (static) background reference image.","","","10.1049/ic:19990621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=831205","","","","2","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Therefore the object and environment models development and their descriptors determination compose a complicated problem. We have developed principles and methods of intelligent object detection for image surveillance automat, denoted iODA, based on artificial intelligence fuzzy expert systems approach. These methods take into account that a complicated environment data renewal can't be used. Object detection in complicated random changing environment requires high representative suspicious object descriptors generation, accumulation of some data analysis of partial results and decoding the multistage object detection results for final decision making. The iODA developed method provides an optimization of the needed processing power, processing time and environment complexity. Many experimental results represent the methods functioning.

Moreover, some constraints of smoothness are used to get a better estimation of its 3D shape and to separate its expression component from its identity component.

The data collection process and the resultant data on lead acid vented batteries used in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) equipment is the subject of this paper. In this paper the use of lead acid batteries in UPS is compared to the use of gel cell-stored batteries in them. Gel cell-stored batteries operate in the same manner as a lead acid battery, but a self-contained gel replaces the liquid chemical that is the electrolyte. Information was obtained on a variety of commercial and industrial facility types (including office buildings, hospitals, water treatment facilities, prisons, utilities, manufacturing facilities, school universities and bank computer centers), with varying degrees of maintenance quality. Data collection guidelines and goals were established to ensure that sufficient operational and maintenance data were collected for statistically valid analysis. Time-to-failure data, helpful in model development, were collected, when available, to determine device failure characteristics. A database system, with flexible output capabilities, was developed to track both the equipment information. The results supported the main hypothesis. Maintenance quality level was a predictor of availability. In addition, the information obtained can aid facility designers and engineers in evaluating different designs to minimize production/mission failure and to estimate the down times associated with various systems or subsystems.","","0-7803-5593-8","10.1109/ICPS.1999.787211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=787211","","Batteries;Uninterruptible power systems;Educational institutions;Maintenance;Chemicals;Industrial plants;Hospitals;Production facilities;Computer aided manufacturing;Guidelines","","1","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Keith Harman","3D Sentry Corporation Inc., Almonte, Ontario, Canada",2018 International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology (ICCST),"23 Dec 2018","2018","","","1","5","Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) cable guided radar presents a true paradigm shift in leaky coaxial cable sensing. Recent technology advancements in Software Defined Radio (SDR) allow this covert terrain following radar to provide reliable detection and pinpoint the location of intruders as they cross the perimeter. MIMO operation enables the use of end-to-end correlation (patents pending) using four times the data used by traditional leaky coaxial cable sensors. Utilizing contra-directionally coupled and co-directionally coupled responses from both ends of the cables, end-to-end correlation doubles the location accuracy for a given bandwidth and reduces sensitivity to RF interference (mutual and 3rd party) - a common problem with other leaky coaxial cable sensors. Since the noise created by nearby metallic fences is a form of multipath, end-to-end correlation suppresses this common source of nuisance alarms. In addition, end-to-end correlation eliminates the need for costly “graded” cables. The use of standard leaky coaxial cables like those made in large quantity for use in communications avoids much of the wasted cable associated with graded cables and it simplifies installation and repair of the cables. These cables are designed for direct burial in many types of mediums. A cable plough can be used in many types of soil as opposed to the traditional trench and backfill approach. The cost savings in using a plough can be dramatic. The co-directionally coupled responses are used to enhance the detection process as well as to communicate response data from one processor to the next. In addition to data, a novel “split-rail” power distribution over the sensor cables minimizes the need for costly infrastructure. Since the cables are in fact the sensor, the cable and processors creates a secure power and data network around the perimeter. Applications include; prisons, nuclear power plants, military sites, VIP residences and borders.","2153-0742","978-1-5386-7931-9","10.1109/CCST.2018.8585477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585477","","Coaxial cables;Sensors;Power cables;Correlation;Radar;Meters;MIMO communication","","","","7","IEEE","23 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Discourage the possibility of airborne attack with a good detection system: amethodology for planning","E. F. Greneker","Georgia Tech Research Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA",Proceedings. International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology,"6 Aug 2002","1989","","","309","311","Detection of the ground intruder has been a subject of primary emphasis when planning an intrusion detection system. The ground intruder has been viewed as the major threat because the ground intrusion scenario does not require a means of sophisticated transport to gain access to a sensitive site. But a new trend is developing that should sensitize the security planners at sensitive facilities to begin to address the airborne threat as a credible intrusion scenario. Within the western hemisphere during the past 10 years, no less than 10 prison escape attempts have utilized helicopters as an escape transport. A terrorist, in an attack that resulted in the deaths of three Mid-East army personnel, used an ultra-light aircraft to circumvent normal border intrusion detection systems. Another terrorist was killed when explosives detonated prematurely in the gondola of his hot air balloon. Through use of the hot air balloon, the terrorists had succeeded in avoiding detection at the border before his explosives accidently detonated. There is another documented case where an innocent airborne intruder succeeded in landing a helicopter within the controlled boundary of a sensitive facility without detection until the pilot solicited assistance from the facility operations personnel. The short history of airborne intrusions and certain intelligence information indicates that the airborne intrusion scenario may be a trend of the future. The airborne intrusion scenario has many advantages over a ground assault. The airborne platform can be used to transport the intruder over traditional barrier systems that are designed to delay the ground intruder. The early-warning ground intrusion sensors are located on and behind the barriers, and the avoidance of the barriers denies security personnel early-waming information usually required for an optimum response, The airborne intruder also has access to the rooftops of buildings which can be used to strategic advantage. This paper serves as an introduction to the methodology that should be considered when planning for defense against the airborne intrusion.","","","10.1109/CCST.1989.751999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=751999","","Helicopters;Aircraft;Personnel;Laser radar;Terrorism;Payloads;Radar detection;Technology planning;Intrusion detection;Explosives","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Reaching the beauty within [Engineering Design]","M. Bond",NA,Engineering & Technology,"30 Oct 2009","2009","4","16","23","25","If you think of yourself as a 'city mouse', no doubt you relish the fast pace of life, the hum of the streets, and unpredictable interactions with strangers that can leave 'country mice' bemused or horrified. This buzz is a large part of the attraction, and the reason why cities tend to be hotbeds of innovation and creativity. But beware: city-living may not be all good for your brain. Recent studies suggest the very stimulation that helps foster ingenuity can result in a kind of cognitive overload, when the effort required to phase out unwanted distractions reduces our capacity for things such as memory formation, attention and self-control. Being surrounded by nature, on the other hand, appears to be highly beneficial. Researchers have shown, for example, that hospital patients recover more quickly when they can see trees from their windows; that children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder show fewer symptoms when surrounded by animals or trees; and that the degree of domestic violence is reduced in apartments with views of greenery. Findings such as these are encouraging urban architects and planners to design places that reflect the restorative effects of nature. More than that, they have spawned a whole new academic discipline in which neuroscientists and architects are collaborating on ways to influence people's behaviour, mood and health through design. The idea is to improve quality of life by building places that reflect the way our brains work. The approach has already led to revolutionary new designs in neo-natal units for premature babies and care-homes for Alzheimer's patients, and is causing architects to rethink the way they design schools, offices, homes, prisons, museums and urban outdoor spaces. John Zeisel is a visiting professor at the University of Salford who has used insights from neuroscience to design care homes for Alzheimer's patients and is planning to do the same for schools and offices. He calls the influence of neuroscience ""potentially revolutionary"" for architecture. ""It's a major shift from thinking about the environment as merely the context for behaviour, to environments having a direct influence on people's behaviour, perception and attitudes via the brain"".","1750-9637","","10.1049/et.2009.1602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305896","","","","","","","","30 Oct 2009","","","IET","IET Magazines"

Viola and Jones present a method capable of accurately and quickly detecting faces in images. This technology can be used to accurately detect the facial features. Face tracking technology provides better opportunities for security and surveillance. This increases the level of protection. For example, facial tracking software helps improve surveillance strategies and serves as a basis for identifying terrorists and criminals. National borders, casinos, museums, banks or prisons are other examples where this system can be used for security. This paper proposes a face detection and eye and smile recognition system with real time images, using the Haar Cascade classifier for face, eye and smile recognition. This trace is based on the jpeg/jpg file format and can be acquired from any type of camera. It works with almost all types of image formats. Its classifier will detect facial features. In this research paper a comparison is also analyzed between face and facial detection by a camera captured image and saved images. Analysis of both types of code is also being made in this research work. The document also gives the percentage of accuracy by comparing the results. Therefore, this work aims at face processing with eye and smile detection. In this article it first detects the face using a web camera and then the captured image is processed and, on the image, it detects the face, eyes and smile.","","979-8-3503-4023-5","10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10404668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10404668","OpenCV;Haar cascade classifier;Viola Jones algorithm;Face detection;Eye detection;Smile detection","Image recognition;Face recognition;Surveillance;Cameras;Security;Facial features;Iris recognition","","","","15","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is necessary to find way of detecting, localising and preventing these kinds of vehicles from penetrating sensitive areas such as airports, prisons and others. This paper presents firstly an analysis of measurements of Radio Frequency (RF) signals emitted from UAVs, collected as CSV file data, and secondly design a methodology to detect the drone angle from sensors using bearing data.

Thousands of parole eligible criminals are denied release every year. We need to consider what effect different factors have on the decision of parole commissioners so that we can know the probability of a prisoner being released from prison. We aim to train a machine learning model with training data of about 20,000 criminals in New York State that would then be able to predict whether a criminal would be granted parole or not. The model would take into consideration various attributes of each criminal like age, gender, race, charges, interview facility, etc. We assume that all these factors are considered by the parole commissioners when taking a decision. The raw data is taken and cleaned before it can be fed to a machine learning algorithm. We convert the string values of our data into numeric values by assigning a unique numeric value to each unique string value. Once we have a dataset with only numeric values, we normalize each attribute. T h e n we feed the normalized data to the Neural Network backpropagation algorithm and the graphical visualizations of the results are obtained using MATLAB.

Conceived initially for use by the U.S. Border Patrol to aid in detecting people smuggled into the U.S. in motor vehicles it also has applications in prisons, defense plants, nuclear plants or any other facility with high security requirements. The ESD's principle of operation is based upon the fact that with each beat of the human heart a force is imparted to the reminder of the body. This force, called the ballistocardiogram, is in turn coupled to any surface with which the body is in contact. The motion of the surface in response to the force although small is detectable with sophisticated signal processing procedures. The ESD employs a sensitive geophone. The resulting signal is first digitized and then filtered. The power in several overlapping time increments is then calculated. The detection criteria is based upon the observation that if the enclosure is enpty the signal will be primarily random noise and the power will vary widely from sanple to sauple. If, however, an enclosure is occupied then the signal will exhibit less variation.","","","10.1109/CCST.1989.751967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=751967","","Detectors;Electrostatic discharge;Vehicle detection;Containers;Space vehicles;Humans;Heart;Signal detection;National security;Costs","","","","4","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People use mobile devices for fun, for work, and for organizing and managing their lives, including their finances. This has become possible because over the past two decades, mobile phones evolved from closed platforms intended for voice calls and messaging to open platforms whose functionality can be extended in myriad ways by third party developers. Such wide-ranging scope of use also means widely different security and privacy requirements for those uses. As mobile platforms gradually opened, platform security mechanisms were incorporated into their architectures so that the security and privacy requirements of all stakeholders could be met. The time is therefore right to take a new look at mobile platform security, which is the intent of this monograph. The monograph is divided into four parts: firstly, the authors look at the how and why of mobile platform security, and this is followed by a discussion on vulnerabilities and attacks. The monograph concludes by looking forward and discussing emerging research that explores ways of dealing with hardware compromise, and building blocks for the next generation of hardware platform security. The authors have intended to provide a broad overview of the current state of practice and a glimpse of possible research directions that can be of use to practitioners, decision makers, and researchers. The focus of this monograph is on hardware platform security in mobile devices. Other forms of Security, such as OS Security, are briefly covered, but from the perspective of motivating hardware platform security. Also, specific high-level attacks such as jail-breaking or rooting are not covered, though the basic attacks described in Part III can, and often are, used as stepping stones for these high-level attacks.","","9781680839777","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9792143.pdf&bkn=9792142&pdfType=book","Privacy and Security","","","","","","","9 Jun 2022","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

By leveraging generative transformer-based LLMs, we present a formal approach to prompt engineering that validates complex specifications and implements formal verification techniques to detect and eliminate hallucinations. Our approach is agnostic to specific LLMs, with performance comparisons across currently popular models. We thoroughly examine the human processes involved to identify entry points where Prompt Engineering can reduce process overhead.

Moreover, fleet of EVs batteries maximum capacity depends upon constraints, such as state of charge (SoC), random arrival, and departure patterns. Hence, to accomodate EVs' batteries with droop controller, it has been enhanced with communication links and feedback mechanism and referred as modified droop controller (MDC). This MDC would be now able to dispatch reference signals to both DES and EVs. However, for meeting reference signal given to fleet of EVs, an aggregator (AG) is proposed. AG can alter the charging and discharging rates of EVs' thereby satisfying EVs' needs in terms of battery's SoC. Extensive simulations have been done using the proposed scheme on data available from Santa Rita Jails' MG.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2651906","Thapar University, Patiala, India; Department of Science and Technology, India(grant numbers:DST/TM/CERI/D48(G)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814324","Charging station (CS);distributed energy sources (DES);electric vehicles (EVs);microgrid (MG) and modified droop controller (MDC)","Frequency control;Batteries;Generators;Voltage control;Microgrids;Electric vehicles","","58","","30","IEEE","11 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The utility of this methodology is demonstrated, analyzing the throughput of virtualized routers by four different virtualization platforms that use two different techniques, which are the paravirtualization (Xen and Citrix Xen) and the OS-level virtualization (Linux Containers and Jails). The results indicate that the virtualization platforms behave differently to distribution of traffic load among virtual routers. Finally, the need for the proposed methodology is motivated by performing extensive throughput tests on the aforementioned platforms at different work points of the network device (i.e. different offered traffic load distribution between virtual routers).","1938-1883","978-1-4673-6432-4","10.1109/ICC.2015.7249425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7249425","virtual router;test methodology;throughput","Virtualization;Throughput;Kernel;Performance evaluation;Telecommunication traffic;Hardware","","22","","16","IEEE","10 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If the communication infrastructure breaks down, however, they become almost useless as most services rely on Internet connectivity. Building post-disaster networks based purely on smartphones remains a challenging task, and, as of today, no practical solutions exist. The rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT) offers the possibility to improve this situation. With an increase in smart spaces such as smart homes and smart offices, we move towards digital cities that are deeply penetrated by IoT technology. Many IoT devices are battery powered and can aid in mediating an emergency network. In scenarios where the electrical grid is still operational, yet communication infrastructure failed, non-battery powered IoT devices can similarly help to relief congestion or build a backup network in case of cyber attacks. With the recent release of the Bluetooth Mesh standard, a common interface between mobile devices and the IoT has become available. The key idea behind this standard is to allow existing and new devices to build large-scale multi-hop sensor networks. By enabling hundreds of devices to communicate with each other, Bluetooth Mesh (BT Mesh) becomes a practical technical solution for enabling communication post disaster. In this paper, we propose a novel emergency network concept that utilizes the parts of digital cities that remains operational in case of disaster, thus mediating large-scale post-disaster device-to-device communication. Since the Bluetooth Mesh standard is backwards compatible to Bluetooth 4.0, most of today's mobile devices can join such a network. No special hardware or software modifications are necessary, especially no jail-breaking of the smartphones.","2377-6919","978-1-7281-1780-5","10.1109/GHTC46095.2019.9033063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033063","Bluetooth Mesh;smart environments;post-disaster communication systems","Bluetooth;Standards;Mesh networks;Mobile handsets;Smart homes;Trade agreements;Protocols","","17","","29","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But distressing news, e.g., COVID-19 death tolls, may trigger negative emotions in public, discouraging them from following the news, which, in turn, can limit the effectiveness of the media. To understand people’s emotional response to the COVID-19 news, we have investigated the prevalence of basic human emotions in around 19 million user responses to 1.7 million COVID-19 news posts on Twitter from (English-speaking) media across 12 countries from January 2020 to April 2021. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify news themes on Twitter. Also, the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model was used to identify emotions in the tweets. Our analysis of the Twitter data revealed that anger was the most prevalent emotion in user responses to the news coverage of COVID-19. That was followed by sadness, optimism, and joy, steadily over the period of the study. The prevalence of anger (in user responses) was higher for the news about authorities and politics while optimism and joy were more prevalent for the news about vaccination and educational impacts of COVID-19 respectively. The prevalence of sadness in user responses, however, was the highest for the news about COVID-19 cases and deaths and the impacts on the families, mental health, jails, and nursing homes. We also observed a higher level of anger in the user responses to the (COVID-19) news posted by the USA media accounts (e.g., CNN Politics, Fox News, MSNBC).

Because physical contact that occurs daily critically accelerates the spread of this disease, a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was specially designed to control civilians’ outdoor social activities through large-scale social distancing methods. Individuals who violate the order will be fined with a compound of not more than RM 1,000 or a jail term of not more than six months or both. This paper presents a mobile application which aims to help civilians control their physical distance towards other individuals, to accelerate social distancing and flatten the curve of increasing cases. In this era where smart devices are largely accessible by people of all backgrounds and age groups, this project can make use of the modern technology that found in the smartphones to notify users and also enable them to monitor the other individuals to avoid physical contact from each other. This project also provides two different types of mediums in order to monitor the distances of users, first mediums is by utilizing the Bluetooth sensor as a beacon that allows users to know if there are other Bluetooth-enabled devices which are too close in contact. Another medium is visually enabling the users to monitor their distance in the physical location based on the camera module through the Augmented Reality.

Sandboxing is designed to thwart such threats as (1) a program created by an attacker or (2) an input crafted to exploit a security vulnerability in a program. Examples of the later include input containing interpreted code or machine language to be injected via a buffer overflow. Traditionally, sandboxes are created by an invoking process. This is effective for (1) but only partially so for (2). For example, when a file is downloaded by a browser or processed as a mail attachment, the invoking process can sandbox it. However, sandboxing protections can be circumvented when the file is copied outside the sandbox. The problem is that traditional sandboxes do not provide complete mediation. We introduce dynamic sandboxes, and show how even when data is saved and/or copied, sandboxing protections are not lost. In addition, and in contrast to traditional sandbox implementations, dynamic sandboxes are implemented using general purpose access controls. Not only does this provide a more flexible sandbox mechanism, and enable complete mediation, but these same primitives can be used to build other (non-sandbox) authorization policies.","1063-9527","978-0-7695-3060-4","10.1109/ACSAC.2007.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4412990","","Protection;Mediation;Access control;Authorization;Operating systems;Buffer overflow;Postal services;Permission;Computer security;Application software","","3","","48","IEEE","2 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Purse seine boats composed the fleet and landings have fluctuated between 14,344 and 48,589 tons during the period between 2006 and 2014. The stock assessment of the austral sardine utilizes a Statistical Catch-at-Length model and this method requires independent estimates of abundance. In order to evaluate the abundance of the austral sardine in the inner sea of the Chilean Patagonia, an acoustic assessment was carried out in Autumn 2013. The study area covered the coastal zone of two administrative regions of Chile, the Los Lagos region in May 2013 and the Aysen region in June 2013. An EK-60 echo sounder permitted to obtain the acoustic data with transducer of 38 and 120 kHz from which echograms were examined to obtain NASC data. A total of 25 fishing set allowed to estimating the species composition and the length structure of the pelagic fish. In addition, fish confined in a jail allowed to estimating the target strength (TS) of the austral sardine. The fishing data and the NASC permitted to evaluate the acoustic biomass of the austral sardine, as well as the biomass of the anchovy (Engraulis ringens) and the common sardine (Strangomera bentincki). The biomass was estimated according to a stratified sampling design, the Gaussian Likelihood Geostatistics technique, and the fit to probability density models. The stratified design included six strata in the Los Lagos region and five strata in the Aysen region, as well as four depth strata (0–50, 50–100, 100–150 and 150–200 m). The stratified estimates of the austral sardine biomass were 118,173 tons (CV=11.6%) in the Los Lagos region and 101,630 tons (CV=9%) in the Aysen region. The estimates of biomass based on Gaussian geostatistics were 122,469 tons (CV=7.6%) in the Los Lagos region and 92,890 (70%) tons in the Aysen region. The best fitting of probability density functions to the acoustic density was log-normal, and allowed to estimate 100,145 tons of austral sardine in the Los Lagos region and 81,965 tons in the Aysen region. The biomass of anchovy was 50,079 tons in the Los Lagos region and 18,668 tons in the Aysen region. The biomass of common sardine was minimal with 5,327 tons in the Los Lagos region only. The estimate of the TS for the austral sardine was −67.59 dB and represented fish between 9 and 17 cm. The study area is spatially heterogeneous, and hydrographical features could determine behaviors of the austral sardine that have not yet described. Therefore, the estimates of biomass here obtained must be regarded as a relative abundance. The basis here obtained will be of importance for monitoring yearly changes in the abundance of the sardine austral.","","978-1-4673-7019-6","10.1109/RIOAcoustics.2015.7473633","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7473633","","Acoustics;Biomass;Transducers;Boats;Sea measurements;Recruitment;Electronic mail","","2","","23","IEEE","19 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analyzing this as a Stackelberg game, we examine what kinds of rights for primaries and secondaries we can credibly enforce. While the primary cannot possibly be made to trust that secondaries will always be honest, it can trust that it will be protected from too much harmful interference and we show how the enforcer can set the ex-post enforcement parameters to do this no matter which secondary user becomes capable of using the band. Similarly, it is impossible to give a universal guarantee to all secondary users that the primary will never make false reports (“cry wolf”) against them. However, it is possible to show that “compatible” secondary users will trust that the primary user will not make false reports against them when the spectrum opportunity is sufficiently attractive for them to use.","","978-1-5090-2830-6","10.1109/DySPAN.2017.7920755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920755","","Interference;Runtime;Games;Mathematical model;Dynamic spectrum access;Biological system modeling;Cost function","","1","","35","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on our observations, in practice, most validators are often geographically concentrated in close proximity. Furthermore, we observed that minority validators tend not to meet the performance requirements, often misidentified as crash failures. Consequently, they are subject to punishment by jailing (removal from the validator set) and/or slashing (penalty in native tokens). Our emulations, under controlled conditions, demonstrate the same results, raising serious concerns about the potential for the geospatial centralization of validators.

Moreover, after the increase of various threats and risks to international supply chains especially after the nine eleven, firms became more responsible and accountable to their respective government for providing specific information regarding the imported or exported products. Penalties for non-compliance can be severe and may result in fines, jail time or loss of markets. That's why we saw appear new configurations at the international supply chain that give more importance to certain non-profit public sector actors, such as Customs. This new form of cooperation and / or public - private partnership for example, through the status of the Authorized Economic Operator “AEO” increase the challenge of piloting and securing flows throughout the international supply chain. Based on the theory that achievement of an integrated international supply chain depends not only on the integration of private companies that form the links in this chain but also the other category of stakeholders such as customs of export country, customs of import country, border protection police, sanitary control authorities, the port authority, this work aims to develop new management ideas for the international supply chain. In fact the importance of international supply chain continues to increase with the globalization of the economy and the growth of international trade and consequently the risk and vulnerability. The purpose of this work is to study the impact of this new integration processes throughout the supply chain such as customs procedures facilitations and in particular through “AEO” certification for a continuous flow of goods and information in the global supply chain and by so to the competitively and performance of firms.","","978-1-4799-4839-0","10.1109/ICAdLT.2014.6864112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864112","“AEO”;customs facilitations;Firm performance;global supply chain;cooperation","Certification;Supply chains;Companies;Security;Economics","","1","","13","IEEE","26 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In short, US experience with spacecraft crew sleep quarters is limited. With few available standards to guide their design, there is significant uncertainty facing spacecraft currently in development, several of which face substantial mass and volume challenges. Those spacecraft developments will face considerable pressure to minimize crew quarters size, including those intended for use on the lunar surface. Given that a crew quarters is the only space a crew member can call his or her own during missions that can last weeks to years in duration, providing an appropriate volume is especially important and the reality is that all crew quarters flown to date have been smaller than minimum standards for US jail cells. This research will categorize functional capabilities of crew quarters and explore physical and virtual prototypes of small crew quarters that have attempted to include these capabilities. The Exploration Atmospheres Test at NASA Johnson Space Center represents the first opportunity to collect multi-day test data on crew quarters of this size in a gravitational environment. Intended to validate exploration prebreathe protocols, this test will house eight people inside a vacuum chamber that has been outfitted as a habitat prototype for twelve days. In addition to their other test activity, the crew will evaluate the acceptability of their crew quarters.

It is often supported by visual analytics. For various reasons (e.g., system failure, interrupted network, intentional information hiding, or bias), visual analytics for sensemaking of data involves missingness (e.g., data loss and incomplete analysis), which impacts human decisions. For example, missing data can cost a business millions of dollars, and failing to recognize key evidence can put an innocent person in jail. Being aware of missingness is critical to avoid such catastrophes. To fulfill this, as an initial step, we consider missingness in visual analytics from two aspects: data-centric and human-centric. The former emphasizes missingness in three data-related categories: data composition, data relationship, and data usage. The latter focuses on the human-perceived missingness at three levels: observed-level, inferred-level, and ignored-level. Based on them, we discuss possible roles of visualizations for handling missingness, and conclude our discussion with future research opportunities.","2771-9553","978-1-6654-8812-9","10.1109/VIS54862.2022.00031","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-2002082,DMS-2152070); Northern Illinois University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973227","Missingness;missing data visualization;sensemaking;visual analytics","Systematics;Costs;Visual analytics;Decision making;Data visualization;Medical treatment;Big Data","","","","49","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although, managing mobility within heterogeneous networks has been a challenge to network operators and manufacturers to ensure quality of service QoS to users, a new challenge has raised in recent years in some countries to control this ubiquitous connectivity in some restricted areas such as exam centers, jails, etc. For example, in Algeria internet is restricted during the national baccalaureate exam disrupting the wireless internet of all the country for almost a week. The same phenomenon is observed in Iraq, Jordan, Syria. Internet disruption causes economic losses and generates a feeling of frustration among people.

These tasks may be extremely useful in several video surveillance scenarios, such as psychiatric wards, prisons, or even in personal camera smartphones. Their potential usability has led to a surge of interest in developing fight or violence detectors. One of the key aspects in this case is efficiency, that is, these methods should be computationally fast. “Handcrafted” spatio-temporal features that account for both motion and appearance information can achieve high accuracy rates, albeit the computational cost of extracting some of those features is still prohibitive for practical applications. The deep learning paradigm has been recently applied for the first time to this task too, in the form of a 3D convolutional neural network that processes the whole video sequence as input. However, results in human perception of other's actions suggest that, in this specific task, motion features are crucial. This means that using the whole video as input may add both redundancy and noise in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a hybrid “handcrafted/learned” feature framework which provides better accuracy than the previous feature learning method, with similar computational efficiency. The proposed method is compared to three related benchmark data sets. The method outperforms the different state-of-the-art methods in two of the three considered benchmark data sets.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2018.2845742","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad(grant numbers:TIN2011-24367); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8375994","Fight recognition;violence recognition;Hough forests;deep learning;2D convolutional neuronal network","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Video sequences;Machine learning;Convolutional neural networks;Detectors","Human Activities;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Neural Networks, Computer;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording;Violence","97","","54","IEEE","8 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sense of presence obtained through an immersive system (whether a Cave or head-tracked head-mounted displays [HMD] and online virtual worlds, such as video games and online virtual worlds) affords the participant unprecedented access to the sights and sounds, and possibly feelings and emotions, that accompany the news. This paper surveys current approaches to immersive journalism and the theoretical background supporting claims regarding avatar experience in immersive systems. We also provide a specific demonstration: giving participants the experience of being in an interrogation room in an offshore prison.

However, the HAR system still has some deficiencies in the aspects of platform algorithms and wireless access technologies. On the one hand, some state-of-the-art frameworks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been proven successfully in classification tasks of HAR, while those frameworks just identify the feature data of activity but ignore the spatial relationship among features, which may lead to incorrect recognition. On the other hand, some existing transmission modes, such as Bluetooth and 4G, are difficult to realize real-time transmission in the case of a large range and low-power consumption. In this paper, a real-time human activity recognition system based on capsule and “long range” (LoRa) is presented, which pioneers the application of capsule to HAR. The capsule framework encapsulates the multiple convolution layers in parallel to solve the defect that current frameworks cannot identify the spatial relationship among features. Simultaneously, the combination of long-distance transmission and low-power consumption is achieved by using LoRa networking technology instead of other existing transmission modes. The experiments are performed on the dataset WISDM that is collected by the Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab in Fordham University, and the results demonstrate that the proposed capsule framework achieves a higher classification result than CNN and RNN, and the proposed system makes the real-time HAR based on intelligent sensor devices possible in some special scenarios such as smart prison.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.3004411","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0831001,2017YFC0803403); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771292); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China(grant numbers:ZR2016FM29); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123413","Human activity recognition (HAR);convolutional neural network (CNN);recurrent neural network (RNN);capsule;long range (LoRa)","Activity recognition;Real-time systems;Data mining;Deep learning;Feature extraction","","17","","47","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is tremendously challenging because on one hand, faces in TV-series are captured in largely uncontrolled conditions with complex appearance variations, and on the other hand, retrieval task typically needs efficient representation with low time and space complexity. To handle this problem, we propose a compact and discriminative representation for the huge body of video data, named compact video code (CVC). Our method first models the face track by its sample (i.e., frame) covariance matrix to capture the video data variations in a statistical manner. To incorporate discriminative information and obtain more compact video signature suitable for retrieval, the high-dimensional covariance representation is further encoded as a much lower dimensional binary vector, which finally yields the proposed CVC. Specifically, each bit of the code, i.e., each dimension of the binary vector, is produced via supervised learning in a max margin framework, which aims to make a balance between the discriminability and stability of the code. Besides, we further extend the descriptive granularity of covariance matrix from traditional pixel-level to more general patch-level, and proceed to propose a novel hierarchical video representation named spatial pyramid covariance along with a fast calculation method. Face retrieval experiments on two challenging TV-series video databases, i.e., the Big Bang Theory and Prison Break, demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed CVC over the state-of-the-art retrieval methods. In addition, as a general video matching algorithm, CVC is also evaluated in traditional video face recognition task on a standard Internet database, i.e., YouTube Celebrities, showing its quite promising performance by using an extremely compact code with only 128 bits.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2616297","973 Program(grant numbers:2015CB351802); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61390511,61222211,61379083,61271445); Strategic Priority Research Program of CAS(grant numbers:XDB02070004); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS(grant numbers:2015085); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China(grant numbers:LQ15F020005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587408","Face video retrieval;covariance matrix;spatial pyramid covariance;compact video code;binary code learning","Face;Binary codes;Covariance matrices;Face recognition;Databases;Data models;Stability analysis","","16","","58","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conflicts pose high risk and hazard to human lives and assets as they ma may result in financial and human loss. The proposed rule-based conflict management model consists of three main stages. The first stage includes strategic deconfliction during the flight plan generation. The second stage, pre-tactical deconfliction, applies a ground delay to the agent to resolve the conflict. The third stage corresponds to the tactical deconfliction, where the drone hovers or loiter in the last waypoint before the conflict area until the conflict time window passes. The proposed method differs from most existing conflict management approaches in that it applies deconfliction methods sequentially using a rule-based strategy. Furthermore, a high number of published studies do not consider realistic airspace constraints and potential airspace modernization concepts such as dynamic flight restrictions Assessment and validation are performed in three simulation scenarios that consider different patterns of the airspace availability in the areas where flights may be restricted, such as airfields, recreational areas, and prisons. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was used for drone path planning. For the simulated scenarios all of the conflicts were resolved after implementation of the proposed method.

Robots are becoming important part of our world, and are starting to interact in domains in which authority is an important aspect, as healthcare, teaching or law enforcement. Yet, there is little research on how people behave when robots show authority. In particular, although extensive investigations have been carried out on how authority can circumvent people's morality with experiments such as Milgram's or Stanford Prison, almost no research evaluated the effect of robots pushing the limits of people's own morality. This experiment tries to study this aspect by using a robot (geminoid) with the appearance, and thus authority of a famous person, and by pushing the boundaries asking morally controversial requests. The results show that, even though most people hesitate and recognize the requests as socially inappropriate, they obey to robots with authority. This suggests that the authority of the robot can push people to perform tasks usually considered as inappropriate.","1944-9437","978-1-5386-7980-7","10.1109/ROMAN.2018.8525744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8525744","","Robots;Education;Task analysis;Law enforcement;Psychology;Hospitals","","11","","59","IEEE","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper addresses the development and deployment of three types of acoustic and vibration based smart sensors to identify and report sequential approaching threats prior to the intrusion. More specifically, we have developed: a) acoustic based long range sensor with which vehicles' engine sound and type can be identified, b) vibration based seismic analyzer which discriminates between human footsteps and other seismic events such as those caused by animals, and c) fence breaching vibration sensor which can detect intentional disturbances on the fence and discriminate between climb, kick, rattle, and lean. All of these sensors were designed with several issues in mind, namely, optimized low power usage, a low number of false positives, small size, secure radio communication, and milspec. The developed vibration based system was installed in an airport with unprotected shore lines in the vicinity of taxi- and run-ways. The system reported an average of less than two false positives per week and zero false negative for the duration of forty-five days. Six fence sensors were installed on the terminal area and end-of-runway chain-link fences where there was possibility of intentional fence climbing. The fence sensors reported no false positives for the duration of forty-five days which included several days of seasonal storms.","","978-1-4244-6048-9","10.1109/THS.2010.5654931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5654931","breach detection;smart sensor;Hebbian learning;Nonhomogeniuos HMM","Vehicles;Training;Humans;Vibrations;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Mathematical model","","11","1","3","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, fairness testing has become an important research topic in DNN testing. At the same time, the neural network coverage criteria (such as criteria based on neuronal activation) is considered as an adequacy test for DNN white-box testing. It is implicitly assumed that improving the coverage can enhance the quality of test suites. Nevertheless, the correlation between DNN fairness (a test property) and coverage criteria (a test method) has not been adequately explored. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic empirical study on seven coverage criteria, six fairness metrics, three fairness testing techniques, and five bias mitigation methods on five DNN models and nine fairness datasets to assess the correlation between coverage criteria and DNN fairness. Our study achieved the following findings: 1) with the increase in the size of the test suite, some of the coverage and fairness metrics changed significantly, as the size of the test suite increased; 2) the statistical correlation between coverage criteria and DNN fairness is limited; and 3) after bias mitigation for improving the fairness of DNN, the change pattern in coverage criteria is different; 4) Models debiased by different bias mitigation methods have a lower correlation between coverage and fairness compared to the original models. Our findings cast doubt on the validity of coverage criteria concerning DNN fairness (i.e., increasing the coverage may even have a negative impact on the fairness of DNNs). Therefore, we warn DNN testers against blindly pursuing higher coverage of coverage criteria at the cost of test properties of DNNs (such as fairness).","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3349001","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62141208,62202414); Key R&D Program in Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2023-YBGY-262); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10384481","Software testing;deep neural networks;deep learning fairness;neuron coverage criteria;bias mitigation","Testing;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Correlation;Measurement;Software;Deep learning","","11","","79","IEEE","8 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such capability may be extremely useful in some video surveillance scenarios like in prisons, psychiatric centers or even embedded in camera phones. Recent work has considered the well-known Bag-of-Words framework often used in generic action recognition for the specific problem of fight detection. Under this framework, spatio-temporal features are extracted from the video sequences and used for classification. Despite encouraging results in which near 90% accuracy rates were achieved for this specific task, the computational cost of extracting such features is prohibitive for practical applications, particularly in surveillance and media rating systems. The task of violence detection may have, however, specific features that can be leveraged. Inspired by psychology results that suggest that kinematic features alone are discriminant for specific actions, this work proposes a novel method which uses extreme acceleration patterns as the main feature. These extreme accelerations are efficiently estimated by applying the Radon transform to the power spectrum of consecutive frames. Experiments show that accuracy improvements of up to 12% are achieved with respect to state-of-the-art generic action recognition methods. Most importantly, the proposed method is at least 15 times faster.","","978-9-8975-8133-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7294968","Action Recognition;Violence Detection;Fight Detection","Acceleration;Feature extraction;Motion pictures;Cameras;Radon;Blood;Transforms","","10","","26","","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Just as spread spectrum technology has revolutionized the communications industry UWB is dramatically changing radar signal processing. These advanced signal processing techniques are adapted to leaky coaxial cable technology in the next generation GUIDAR to provide new features and enhanced performance. At the core of the new technology is an ultra high-speed digital correlator implemented in a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Complementary orthogonal codes based on Golay codes are used to produce thumbtack correlation functions simultaneously in multiple range bins. The net result is ""near continuous wave (CW)"" performance (97% duty cycle) in forty to eighty 11.6-meter long-range bins with targets located within one meter along the length of cable. This is a dramatic improvement over the 3% duty cycle of the original GUIDAR and the typical 100 to 200 meter long zones of current CW leaky cable sensors. Orthogonal complementary codes are transmitted on each of two leaky coaxial cables. The responses from the parallel receive cables are fed to a direct digital receiver. The orthogonal nature of the code allows the composite coded pulse response to be de-multiplexed into the independent response for each of the two cables. This ultra-high speed correlation process involves the addition and subtraction of the sampled in-phase and quadrature-phase responses to the multiple range bin accumulators at 10 million samples per second. Synchronous sampling at twice the chip rate ensures that each target is observed in three adjacent sample bins. The phase and amplitude response in the three adjacent samples are combined to precisely pinpoint (within 1 meter) the locations of targets along the length of each of the two cables. The ability to precisely locate and track multiple simultaneous targets on each of two cables leads to numerous new features and performance benefits relative to existing leaky cable sensors. With a separate calibrated threshold for every meter of cable the sensor sensitivity is much more uniform and installation restrictions on burial depth, cable spacing, and medium homogeneity can be relaxed. Potential sources of nuisance alarms can easily be located and overcome. The pinpoint location can be used to provide better CCTV assessment, target capture for video motion sensors and more effective response to intrusions. Through the use of parallel cables the sensor can be used to detect the direction of crossing and to classify targets such as small animals, people, and vehicles. This patented next generation of GUIDAR technology represents a dramatic step forward from that which was introduced at the 1976 Carnahan Conference in Lexington, Kentucky, and the numerous CW leaky coaxial cable sensors that evolved from that work.

This paper proposes a novel architecture of end-to-end CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory) model that can run on low-cost Internet of Things (IOT) device such as raspberry pi board. The paper utilized CNN to learn spatial features from video's frames that were applied to LSTM for video classification into violence/non-violence classes. A complex dataset including two public datasets: RWF-2000 and RLVS-2000 was used for model training and evaluation. The challenging video content includes crowds and chaos, small object at far distance, low resolution, and transient action. Additionally, the videos were captured in various environments such as street, prison, and schools with several human actions such as eating, playing basketball, football, tennis, and swimming. The experimental results show good performance of the proposed violence detection model in terms of average metrics having an accuracy of 73.35 %, recall of 76.90 %, precision of 72.53 %, F1 score of 74.01 %, false negative rate of 23.10 %, false positive rate of 30.20 %, and AUC of 82.0 %.

This growing use raises concerns about the threats drones pose to the security of sensitive areas such as airports, prisons, industrial and military facilities. In response to these threats, drones detection methods are being actively developed. In particular, most camera-based methods rely on appearance to perform detection. They are therefore prone to error due to the great similarity between drones and some other flying entities such as birds. However, from a kinematic perspective, unlike birds, drones, especially multicopters, have a propeller rotation speed. The method proposed in this paper uses the propeller rotation speed as the key physical parameter on which to rely to unambiguously distinguish drones from other flying entities. The basic idea consists in using discrete Fourier transform to determine the propellers rotation speed from high frame rate videos, and extracting the propellers induced drone signature as a quantitative camera-based drone signature. The proposed algorithm proceeds as follows: flying entities are continuously tracked in the sky; discrete Fourier transform, applied to the video stream within a time window ending at the current instant (frame), is used to extract the propellers induced drone signature which unambiguously confirm each flying entity as being a drone or not. Experimental results obtained using a consumer-grade camera at a frame rate of  $240Hz$  demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3170481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762904","Drone detection;discrete Fourier transform;high speed camera;propellers induced drone signature;propeller rotation speed;unambiguous drone signature","Drones;Propellers;Cameras;Videos;Radar tracking;Radar;Radar detection","","5","","72","CCBYNCND","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At first, this is surprising, as the underlying technology has been known for years and solutions already exist based on WiFi or Bluetooth beacons. A major problem is, that the locations of those beacons need to be highly tailored to the specific indoor floorplan for high positioning accuracies, which directly contradicts the need for a cheap installment.

Software engineering could take lessons from either discipline, and this is not simply an academician's lament; the cost of software is enormous and risk to public safety daunting. Many of us regard the 1968 NATO conference as the birth of software engineering, which was then regarded as the design of computer programs and software-intensive systems within a performance, quality, and economical framework. Like circuit and genetic engineers, software engineers should look first to the underlying science for vocabulary, methods and tools. Software is the hope and means for progress in science and in better industrial products, yet software engineering seems to be languishing in a dark prison of its own making. Professional societies, industry associations and government regulators must certify products in narrow specializations. Programming language compilers is an area that is sufficiently mature to support effective certification protocols.

Many techniques from Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) have been used to clarify the ambiguity. With these techniques, the correct sense of a word according to its particular context can be determined. In English, there exist many ambiguous words. For example, the word cell may have different meanings based on its context. For instance, it may mean the basic structural unit of all organisms in biology domains, or it may mean a device that delivers an electric current as the result of a chemical reaction in textual materials about technology or electricity, or it completely means another different thing: a room where a prisoner is kept in textual materials about prison. In this study, to enhance the performance of the WSD task, we develop a methodology with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), including normalization, thresholding, and regularization modules. We attempt to improve the traditional Text GCN algorithm with a semantic diffusion process, which increases the classification performance of the WSD task. As far as we know, there is no work for such a comprehensive classifier for the WSD task in English. To show the effect of the suggested model, we performed experiments on the SensEval dataset, which is a very popular dataset and benchmark in the WSD domain.

Our aim is to identify efficient jamming strategies against LTE that can be implemented in commercial jammer. Firstly, we study the vulnerabilities of the 6 channels and signals presented in the literature as the weakest points of LTE to jamming. Secondly, through experiments carried out on real life LTE networks, we observe that although these channels and signal seems strongly vulnerable to jamming with regard to the specification, they are not so vulnerable in practice due to some constructors specific mechanisms.

To ensure that intelligent Contracts can function in a compliant way, comprehensive legal frameworks should be advanced and included to define liabilities, establish enforcement procedures, and defend the parties’ rights. A sizable task in this manner is that clever Contracts aren’t necessarily sure by the prison framework of a specific jurisdiction and may be concerned with exclusive legal guidelines relying on the parties’ agreement and the geographic places of the events. As such, felony frameworks should be transportable throughout jurisdictions to ensure a steady and harmonized regulatory panorama.

Charged with overseeing shipbuilding and various manufacturing ventures, Samuel conceived of a unique solution for the challenge his supervisors faced: how to train and monitor workers who were inexperienced in their craft. Through a series of letters and conversations, the brothers refined the design of the panopticon, a structure that would allow a single person in a middle tower to oversee the doings of the individuals in various rooms around the tower, built as a tiered rotunda. In England, Jeremy furthered the design, and with his interest in social reform, applied the panopticon structure to a prison, wherein a central tower would be surrounded by all the prisoners' cells. All the cells would be open to the watchful eye of the guard, but because of the panopticon's design, none of the inmates would know if they were being watched. A key feature of the design was its potential effect on those being watched: it was assumed that because inmates would not be able to discern whether or not they were being surveilled, they would regulate their own behavior. Panopticism therefore emerged as both an architectural design that would be helpful to those wanting to observe others' behavior and a theoretical construct of surveillance.","","9780262368896","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9758098.pdf&bkn=9743998&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","15 Apr 2022","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

This paper aims to uncover the aspirational requirements in the implementation of integrated criminal justice systems (ICJS) in Indonesia. It involved four main agencies: police, prosecutor office, court, and prison, as well as some auxiliary agencies. The research is contrasting the aspiration-based design with rational alignment needs as defined in the classic Strategic Alignment Model. The extension of this classic IT alignment framework provides the inter-relationship discourses between business strategy, business infrastructure, technology strategy, and technology infrastructure in the inter-organizational context. This paper found out that multi-organizational IT alignment framework not always suitable in multi-organizational IT implementation. Improving the alignment inside the respective organization may be provide better answer to address the misaligned situation.

However, with the acceleration of this technology ethical issues are starting to come to the forefront of the conversation. Editing people’s genes has the potential to harken back to the times of Francis Galton who argued that society should be pushing marriages between the most intelligent and fit of society [2]. As this technology continues to outpace the legal and ethical discussion, it is critical to have a thorough conversation as a scientific community as to what is acceptable in this field.On November 25th, 2018, Dr. He Jiankui announced to the world that his team successfully created the first genome-edited babies. Lulu and Nana were twins born to an HIV positive Dad and an HIV negative Mom with embryos that were made resistant to the M-tropic strain of HIV [3]. Dr. He’s research was unprecedented, and it was met with near unanimous condemnation from both the Chinese scientific community as well as the world at large. The outrage in the community brings up an interesting ethical discussion on whether the suffering of a small group of people for the greater good is acceptable. Act-utilitarianism discusses this in depth by saying that things are ethical and virtuous if the experiment has a net positive on society. However, those that champion rule-utilitarianism would shout act-utilitarianism down by saying we must follow rules even if the exception would be beneficial to the rule breaker [4].Analyzing Dr. He’s actions through the lenses of act and rule utilitarianism, it offers different perspectives on the ethical implications of his actions. According to act utilitarianism, proponents might argue that his practice was successful in conferring resistance to HIV and could potentially benefit the individuals involved by preventing them from contracting the virus. However, critics might argue that the ‘potential’ benefits were speculative, while the harms, long-term or immediate, were significant. The lack of transparency raises concerns about the well-being of the individuals involved and the broader societal implications of human germline editing. The rule utilitarianism perspective might argue that Dr. He’s actions violate fundamental ethical norms governing human experimentation and genetic manipulation. On the other hand, one might contend that rigid adherence to rules can lead to suboptimal outcomes when exceptions could result in greater overall happiness [4]. Under this lens, the breach of ethical principles outweighs potential benefits, given the risks associated with human germline editing. This paper seeks to explore how a middle ground can be found between shifting society towards eugenics and the amazing potential that gene editing has on increasing lifespan, decreasing suffering, and improving quality of life for tens of millions of people across the world. Analyze this specific case from multiple perspectives is especially important because following Dr. He’s prison release in April 2022, he stated that he would continue his practice [5].","2994-3531","979-8-3503-8514-4","10.1109/SIEDS61124.2024.10534729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534729","","Ethics;Pediatrics;Embryo;Law;Genomics;Oral communication;Bioinformatics","","","","14","IEEE","21 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prisons and correctional departments play a critical role in ensuring low crime levels while minimizing the incarcerated population. This paper examines recidivism using data from the Namibia Correctional Service (NCS) to understand the factors influencing recidivism. The analysis reveals insights into factors such as socioeconomic conditions and deficiencies in the Correctional Service. Feature importance methodologies, including Random Forest, Permutation Importance, and Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI), were employed to quantify the influence of each factor on recidivism. This approach is useful not only for predictive modeling but also for understanding the weighting of these factors, thereby providing a basis for prioritizing and allocating resources towards recidivism mitigation efforts. Five machine learning models were trained: Artificial Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with Naive Bayes exhibiting superior performance in terms of AVC-ROC value. This study contributes to the understanding of machine learning and its growing application areas. Specifically, it presents a comparative analysis of machine learning models for recidivism prediction. The observations underscore the need for robust models to handle complex criminal justice datasets. Besides enhancing our understanding of determinants impacting recidivism, the insights gained can also serve as a guide to policymakers and correctional authorities in their efforts to rehabilitate inmates for reintegration into society.","","979-8-3503-5326-6","10.1109/ETNCC63262.2024.10767433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767433","machine learning;recidivism;predictive modelling","Computational modeling;Prevention and mitigation;Impurities;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Market research;Bayes methods;Decision trees;Socioeconomics;Random forests","","","","22","IEEE","4 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are several programming tools that are usually used in schools, Scratch being one of the most famous. In general, Arduino boards are widely used in educational contexts, given their open hardware design as well as the myriad of technical and educational resources that are available freely, and that they allow to work with physical programming as well as with full scale projects. Arduino boards are usually programmed using the Arduino IDE, that is text-based, as well as with block based tools such as mBlock, proprietary tools for Arduino-compatible boards and even extensions of Scratch. Those tools have limitations in order to be used in schools, given that they require the learning of text or block syntax, even when the latter has a softer learning curve. Particularly, some block programming tools are specific to certain kits or boards, do not include a variety of blocks for generic sensors and actuators, have very few blocks that facilitate the programming or are not available in widely used languages such as Spanish. In this work we present the block based Arduino programming Arduino en la Escuela (AelE, that could be translated from Spanish as “Arduino at the School”), that excels in versatility, given that it was used with students from ages, sociocultural context, as well as previous knowledge. The tool was used for courses mostly with secondary school students, but it was also applied in other contexts as with younger children and adults, as well as with teachers and even as part of a prison education program.

One of the most prominent (and mind-bending) is the Liar's Paradox, a puzzle created by self-reference or our ability to make statements that refer to themselves. If a person says “I am a liar,” we are forced to conclude that the sentence is both true and false: a liar that tells the truth is not a liar; but then he is deceiving us, which confirms he is a liar after all, which in turn means he is telling us the truth, and so on. This circularity creates a prison for the mind, challenging our most entrenched intuitions of what truth and knowledge mean. The paradox presents an epistemological problem that has attracted constant attention over the centuries and has stirred many controversies in the attempts to solve it (Sainsbury 2008). As unnerving as the puzzle might be, however, its persistence has not been futile: it has encouraged philosophers and mathematicians to develop formal languages that do not fall into the contradictions of everyday talk. These formal languages, in fact, offer the encoding rules that make our current communication technologies possible—they are the languages that allow our computers to speak in their logically flawless way.","","9780262343459","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8290875.pdf&bkn=8278549&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","15 Feb 2018","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

The voice demodulated by a traditional algorithm based on 3×3 fiber coupler has unstable background noise intensity with the change of the working point of the interferometer. The unstable noise comes from the shot noise of photodetectors. The sound extraction method proposed in this paper uses the relation between shot noise and light intensity to smooth the unstable noise and does not affect the quality of voice monitoring. Voice monitoring systems using this algorithm have stable monitoring quality without any working point control technology. The fluctuation range of noise intensity in 300~3500 Hz decrease from 10 dB to less than 2 dB compared with the traditional demodulation algorithm.

The increase of ICT and digital data storage, in industrial, financial, healthcare or other application areas with the increasing amounts of collection of images, signals and other types of data certainly provides several research challenges. There is a need to design intelligent tools to extract the underlying information, predict, diagnose, estimate or make use of it in some other way, in order to optimize or improve services.

Let me begin with a disclaimer: I am making no legal excuses for the participants in the current scandal. I am only offering contextual background that places it in the broader academic, cultural, and political perspective required for understanding. It is only the most recent installment of a well-worn narrative: the controlling elite make their own rules and live by them, if they can get away with it. Unfortunately, some of the participants, who are either serving or facing jail time, didn’t know to not go into a gunfight with a sharp stick. Money alone is not enough to avoid prosecution for fraud: you need political clout. The best protection a defendant can have is a prosecutor who fears political reprisal. Compare how the Koch brothers escaped prosecution for stealing millions of oil dollars from Native American tribes1,2 with the fate of actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, who, at the time of this writing, face jail time for paying bribes to get their children into good universities.3,4 In the former case, the federal prosecutor who dared to empanel a grand jury to get at the truth was fired for cause, which put a quick end to the prosecution. In the latter case, the prosecutors pushed for jail terms and public admonishment with the zeal of Oliver Cromwell. There you have it: stealing oil from Native Americans versus trying to bribe your kids into a great university. Where is the greater crime? Admittedly, these actresses and their","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2019.2951211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8960931","","","","1","","23","IEEE","15 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The movie starts with Will getting married to his new wife (Grace Kelly) in a small western town in the late 1800s. He retired as a very successful sheriff and was leaving town forever with his new bride, when he found out that a bad guy, Frank Miller, was returning from jail (where Will sent him) on the noon train to meet some of his friends and kill the people who sent him to jail. The movie takes place in “real time:” less than two hours. The clock is regularly shown as Will attempts to get people in the town to help him confront the bad guys. The town people had a lot of respect for Will when he was sheriff, but when he postpones leaving in order to deal with Miller and his gang, Will finds that recruiting volunteers to help him confront the four armed men is impossible. Everyone has various excuses for not helping him, including, “It is not my problem.” Will had doubts about his decision and was very scared. At noon, Will goes to meet Miller and his gang all alone. After he kills the gang as the town watches from safety, he throws his sheriff's badge on the ground and rides away with his wife.","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2011.6138464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6138464","","Ethics","","","","","IEEE","26 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Argues that the emergence of new computer and information technologies since the 1970s through the current explosion of online access to global audiences and media outlets has radically changed the political, economic, and cultural landscapes to the detriment of society. Such change led to a diminished respect for the facts, a decrease in political discourse, and lack of critical thinking and analysis. The mass market audience is subject to media manipulation, questionable facts, targeted messaging, false advertising, and a lack of values. ""Perhaps most importantly, through private ownership of both the media and the means of social coordination, their power is used to dominate information dissemination. In this way, klepto-kakistocrats create an entrenched establishment and compliant media that frames politics and opinion in such a way that they can accumulate greater wealth, more power, rig markets with greater impunity, and so on. However: this too will pass. It will either end in tears or in jail terms, but in the aftermath, restoring respect for the facts, values, and dialogues in policy formation and decision-making will be a significant, but necessary challenge to address."" Hopefully, technology can be developed to counter these negative influences and developed and used in such a way that improves society.","1937-416X","","10.1109/MTS.2019.2894454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8664503","","Media;Ethics;Government;Economics;Education;Rhetoric;Communication effectiveness;Public speaking","","2","","18","IEEE","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Simply consider as examples its use in car navigation systems or walking around city streets with the help of a smart phone. However, GPS is unavailable inside buildings, in urban canyons, underground, and underwater. Developing complementary location and tracking technologies for these environments would unleash the use of such capabilities in many applications in the military, public safety, and commercial arenas. Within residences and nursing homes, for example, there is an increasing need for indoor geolocation systems to track people with special needs, the elderly, and children to relieve the need for around-the-clock visual monitoring. Other applications include systems to assist the visually impaired, locate instrumentation and other equipment in hospitals, and track specific items in warehouses. In first responder/public safety and military applications, indoor geolocation systems are needed to monitor inmates in prisons, locate miners trapped in mines, and track/guide first responders and soldiers inside buildings. Given the growing interest in sensor networks and radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies, one can also envision wider-ranging applications such as locating unwanted chemical, biological, or radioactive materials using sensor networks, and tracking specific items such as controlled pharmaceuticals in their containers using RFID tags.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.2011.5751290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751290","","Special issues and sections;Tracking;Global Positioning System;Radiofrequency identification;Mobile radio mobility management","","20","","","IEEE","15 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Did you get your vaccination yet? Affluenza infects more people than you think. Statistics dramatically understate the epidemic. There was a devastating case in Texas that killed four people (http://www.forbes.com/sites/dalearcher/2013/12/16/the-affluenza-epidemic/). A 16-year-old boy from a rich family was drunk from drinking beer he stole from a Wal-Mart store when he drove his vehicle into four people and killed them. He confessed to intoxication manslaughter and was found guilty. The evidence to convict the boy was overwhelming. During the sentencing, a psychologist testifed that the boy suffered from affluenza. Affluenza infects children of wealthy families. Symptoms include a sense of entitlement and irre sponsibility. The infected make excuses for poor behavior because parents have not set proper boundaries. The term affluenza originated in the 1970s by blending the words “affluent” and “influenza“ (http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/affluenza). Rather than giving him the maximum 20-year prison sentence prosecutors were seeking, the judge gave him 10 years of probation. His harsh sentence requires therapy at a treatment facility in California, for which his parents will reportedly pay more than $450,000 a year. Will health insurance cover that?","1558-4143","","10.1109/MAP.2014.6821787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821787","","Ethics;Economics","","","","","IEEE","29 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
