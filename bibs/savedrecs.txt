AB Federal prisons in the early 20th century used the technology of radio
   for distinct ends. The prison at Atlanta facilitated a broadcast concert
   at the local radio station, with an entirely incarcerated band. At
   Leavenworth, in Kansas, a warden tried to maintain control over his
   facility by permitting long radio listening hours for prisoners through
   individual headsets wired into cells rather than in areas where people
   could gather. Meanwhile, prison educators believed radio to be a
   powerful tool in their mission to reform their subjects. This moment of
   indetermination-for both radio and the new Federal Bureau of
   Prisons-offers insight into the role of media in the practice of
   incarceration, as well as in the struggle against it.

AB This article explores the effect that communications technology has on
   hegemonic power. The first section establishes a theoretical framework
   combining Foucault's carceral archipelago theory with Chiara Bottici's
   concept of the social imaginal describing the medium through which
   inter- and trans-subjective imagination occurs. The remainder employs
   this framework to examine how four technological innovations (print
   media, radio, television and Internet) impact the (re)production of
   discursive hegemonic ideology, integrating a variety of historical and
   contemporary theories on public discourse and ideological dominance. I
   conclude by arguing that each case demonstrates a dialectic pattern that
   explains the techno-social evolution of the carceral archipelago.

AB The UK government's Transforming Our Justice System agenda represents an
   emerging system of penal governance. Its cumulative impact, manifested
   through the mainstreaming of virtual hearings, a system of automatic
   online convictions and the Single Justice Procedure is a story yet to
   tell, with the potential impact on marginalised women simply a footnote.
   Such women, well-documented victims of the legal aid cuts as well as the
   digital divide, must comply with and negotiate the requirements of the
   carceral web alone. Pursuance of the reforms, representing the next
   instalment in the neo-liberal justice agenda, exposes another example of
   life at the penal-welfare nexus. This precarious territory has burgeoned
   since government-imposed austerity, with implications for
   self-criminalisation, net-widening and social justice. Reforms couched
   in the language of 'efficiency' and 'common sense' are likely to run in
   direct opposition to what marginalised women might need (or respond well
   to) and may jeopardise official reductionist strategies.

AB This inquiry explores how data analyses about US Federal sentences have
   transformed sentencing practice beginning in the mid-1980s. I consider
   this inquiry an early case of the datafication of law, a pervasive
   process that translates legal practice into data and embeds it in
   digital networks so it can be tracked and analyzed in real time. To
   explore datafication historically and in relation to legal practice and
   power, I consider it not as an objective and passive undertaking but,
   rather, as an ideological and performative process that encodes and
   enacts normative presumptions and desirable futures. The empirical
   inquiry traverses "levels of analysis" and thus bridges prominent
   perspectives in sociolegal research. In so doing, I identify four
   mechanisms that mediate "large-scale" processes and "local" practices:
   field assembly, symbolic projection, material inscription, and
   boundaries spanning. Substantively, I show how datafication has not
   simply described, but also transformed, sentencing practice according to
   a colorblind-carceral imaginary that strives to fix the present in
   place. By relentlessly translating decisions into data forms that derive
   from this carceral imaginary, datafication affects judicial action and
   partakes in sustaining legacies of oppression. Yet, like other
   technologies, datafication also reveals dialectic dimensions in opening
   up to new actors and subjecting its ideological underpinnings to
   contestation and change.

AB This article counters the view (albeit contested) of race as a natural
   empirical object with technology as a secondary, external entity applied
   to it. Instead, I posit race itself as a technology that is inherently
   discriminatory in motivation, design and function, as evident throughout
   its brutally effective history. Focusing on the post/genomic era, I
   consider contemporary forms of molecular racialization as the latest
   technological iteration of race as a disciplinary device. I characterize
   this biopolitical racial technology as operant through a carceral
   methodology in four stages: (a) the epistemological mutability of
   molecular racialization as reiterating the obscurantist claim of modern
   raciology to constitute a benign description of literal racial
   difference; (b) the ontological de-individualization of certain racial
   others as aggregated risky populations and legitimate targets of
   repressive management; (c) a predictive empiricism whereby molecular
   race is seen as indicative of potential behaviours that sanctions
   oppressive state interventions against specific populations; (d) a
   normative bioethical dissembling whereby state agencies' exploitation of
   target molecular racialized populations' vulnerabilities result in the
   debarment of proper ethical consideration and the right to justice.
   Drawing largely on criminal justice and immigration control examples,
   the article asserts that the carceral methodologies of molecular
   racialization demonstrate race as a repressive technology designed to
   (re)produce subaltern racial populations and propagate racism.

AB Scholars and policymakers have long debated whether electronic
   monitoring programs can be understood as a carceral experience. Recent
   changes to the technology that utilize 24/7 location monitoring through
   GPS are changing the nature of electronic monitoring. Given these
   changes, this article revisits the question of the "pains" of electronic
   monitoring and its comparison to incarceration. I focus on three
   practices of electronic monitoring programs: home searches,
   communication monitoring, and long-term data storage to illustrate the
   ways in which the loss of autonomy, one of Sykes's original pains of
   imprisonment, is reproduced and remade. Rather than focusing on the
   aspects of programs that confine or limit the mobility of individuals, I
   draw on the tradition in carceral geography to consider how these
   practices recreate carcerality in new spaces and highlight the ways in
   which the experience of electronic monitoring is made carceral through
   the privacy intrusions and infringements to the self.

PD DEC 2023
PY 2023
AB In virtually all areas of law, the home is the ultimate constitutionally
   protected area, at least in theory. In practice, a range of modern
   institutions that target private life-from public housing to child
   welfare-have turned the home into a routinely surveilled space. Indeed,
   for the 4.5 million people on criminal court supervision, their home is
   their prison, or what I call a "carceral home." Often in the name of
   decarceration, prison walls are replaced with restrictive rules that
   govern every aspect of private life and invasive surveillance technology
   that continuously records intimate information. While prisons have
   always been treated in the law as sites of punishment and diminished
   privacy, homes have not. Yet in the carceral home people have little
   privacy in the place where they presumptively should have the most. If
   progressive state interventions are to continue, some amount of home
   surveillance is surely inevitable. But these trends raise a critical,
   underexplored question: When the home is carceral, what is, or should
   be, left of the home as a protected area? This Article addresses that
   question. Descriptively, it draws on a fifty-state analysis of court
   supervision rules to reveal the extent of targeted invasions of intimate
   life in the name of rehabilitation or an alternative to prison,
   rendering the home a highly surveilled space. Normatively, it argues
   that allowing this state of affairs with no corresponding adaptations in
   legal doctrine is untenable.

AB The practice of credit scoring is ubiquitous in today's economy.
   Three-digit credit scores or their underlying data are applied well
   beyond the lending decisions for which they were originally designed and
   are routinely used in the contexts of employment, housing, and more.
   Drawing on carceral logics and abolitionist politics, we develop a
   framework to critically interpret the practice of credit scoring. We
   theorize credit scoring as a carceral practice and technology in the
   afterlife of slavery that expands anti-black discipline and punishment.
   We suggest that credit scoring is incapable of objectively assessing
   risk and that claims of objectivity legitimize an exploitative system of
   evaluation that mediates people's access to the means of survival.
   Moreover, credit scoring expands the scope of how people are conscripted
   into consumerism and disciplined and punished under racial capitalism.
   We review research literature on credit scoring as a step toward
   applying this framework and demonstrate how research provides an alibi
   for anti-black racism embedded in contemporary credit scores. We
   conclude with a call to abolish the practice of credit scoring and
   imagine new, abolitionist alternatives for people to live safely and
   with dignity.

   outcomes for persons with HIV involved in the carceral system in the
   USA, a population with high unmet HIV care needs.
   Recent Findings Few recent intervention studies focus on improving HIV
   care outcomes for this population. Successful strategies to improve care
   outcomes include patient navigation, substance use treatment, and
   incentivizing HIV care outcomes. Technology-supported interventions are
   underutilized in this population. Notable gaps in the existing
   literature include intervention research addressing HIV care needs for
   cisgender and transgender women and those under carceral supervision in
   the community.
   Summary Future research should address existing gaps in the literature
   and respond to emergent needs including understanding how the changing
   HIV care delivery environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and
   the approval of new injectable ART formulation shape HIV care outcomes
   in this population.

AB In spite of a growing interest in ethical approaches to computation,
   engineers and quantitative researchers are often not equipped with the
   conceptual tools necessary to interrogate, resist, and reimagine the
   relationships of power which shape their work. A liberatory vision of
   computation requires de-centering the data in "data ethics" in favor of
   cultivating an ethics of encounter that foregrounds the ways computation
   reproduces structures of domination. This article draws from a rich body
   of feminist scholarship that explores the liberatory potential of
   refusal as a practice of generative boundary setting. To refuse is to
   say no-to reject the default categories, assumptions and problem
   formulations which so often underpin dataintensive work. But refusal is
   more than just saying no; it can be a generative and strategic act, one
   which opens up space to renegotiate the assumptions underlying
   sociotechnical endeavors. This article explores two complementary
   modalities of refusal in computation: "refusal as resistance" and
   "refusal as recentering the margins." By exploring these two modes of
   refusal, the goal of this paper is to provide a vocabulary for
   identifying and rejecting the ways that sociotechnical systems reinforce
   dependency on oppressive structural conditions, as well as offer a
   framework for flexible collective experimentation towards more free
   futures.

AB In March 1980, fifty men suffocated to death in the back of a police
   van, known as a Black Maria, in Lagos, Nigeria. In the Black Maria
   Tragedy, as it came to be called, several currents of Nigeria's
   postcolonial history converged. They included the persistent problem of
   crime, the question of how much power to give men in uniform, and the
   problems of migration and regional integration (most of the victims came
   from neighboring countries). This article examines the 1980 incident not
   only for what it reveals about Nigeria, but about the larger workings of
   punishment in a postcolonial state. What techniques of punishment
   endured after the end of colonialism? Which of them did African
   governments find useful, and which did they discard? Where did the
   technology of the Black Maria come from, and what part did it play in

AB This article provides an analysis of sonic protest strategies used by
   anti-carceral feminist coalitions in Melbourne, Australia. Our research
   demonstrates that sound is a particularly powerful boundary-crosser that
   can challenge the exclusionary spatial ordering of the prison. Under
   certain political and geographical conditions, the carceral soundscape,
   which increasingly restricts 'who gets to hear what', can be temporarily
   breached, altered and re-made by protest noise, rhythm and music, and
   radio technology. Counter-carceral acoustemologies create alternative
   'soundtracks' of resistance that both reveal and momentarily displace
   carceral-spatial control, re-patterning the aural environment of the
   prison. Such breaches can be countered, however, by various modes of
   boundary fortification over time. We propose that a more nuanced
   understanding of carceral space and soundscapes-as relational and in
   flux-provides greater opportunities for denaturalizing the prison and
   challenging its seeming permanence in our political and cultural
   landscapes.

AB The over-reliance on incarceration in the USA is a racialized phenomenon
   which has affected millions of families - disproportionately people of
   colour - reconfiguring kinship around the criminal legal system. Mass
   incarceration, then, disrupts conventional modes of reproduction and
   threatens reproductive justice, separates families and funnels children
   into foster care, diverts funds from social services into prisons,
   restricts women's access to abortion and adequate pregnancy care,
   shackles women in childbirth, and incarcerates people during their prime
   reproductive years. Beyond these obvious disruptions to reproduction,
   incarceration also cultivates certain ways of being a parent. Much of
   the critical literature on mass incarceration focuses on men, largely
   because of fewer women and masculinist assumptions of the carceral
   system. This paper looks specifically at how women's reproduction is
   experienced and managed by carceral institutions, and how mass
   incarceration itself is a reproductive technology. Based on ethnographic
   fieldwork at a women's jail, I explore pregnancy and motherhood behind
   bars. Certain types of mothering are foreclosed, while an idealized
   version of maternal identity is simultaneously promoted. For many
   incarcerated women, jail is the only place where they can experience
   this form of motherhood, as forces of structural violence outside of
   jail often limit their ability to parent, such as involvement of child
   welfare institutions, addiction and homelessness. The myriad ways in
   which incarcerated women's reproduction is suppressed and enabled is a
   critical lens through which to understand how institutions and forces of
   racial oppression reinforce idealized notions of motherhood while making
   them categorically unattainable.

AB COVID-19 lockdowns accelerated the take up of video calls and other
   digital communication between people in prison and the outside world.
   This has altered relationships with families and practice within
   rehabilitative and reintegration services. Little work has discussed the
   significance of these changes or articulated a normative agenda for
   shaping changes in future. This article aims to identify strategies that
   might help reintegration services and justice system agencies maximise
   the benefits and minimise the harms from information communication
   technology (ICT) use between people in prison and their families and
   services. Drawing from empirical literature, practical insights from
   service delivery and theoretical insights from assemblage theory and
   carceral geography, this article proposes three strategies: design
   spatial, scheduling and security measures to minimise stigma and
   disruption; actively support ICT users to equitably access the potential
   of ICT systems; and develop program practices in parallel with the
   evolutions of the technology they employ. Each of these strategies is
   set out with sub-components and suggestions for further research.

AB As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different
   aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging
   increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately
   affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from
   incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral
   system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been
   exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been
   isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration.
   Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the
   incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison
   education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them.
   Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population.
   Consequently, womenin-transition face significant post-incarceration
   challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus
   have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against
   this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted
   empirical research as part of technology education offered to
   women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results
   from our interviews with 75 womenin-transition in the Midwest that were
   conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the
   women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of
   color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we
   discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program
   for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program.
   Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public
   libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March
   due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed
   primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort
   with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows
   that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of
   resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues
   that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among
   women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical
   implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other
   marginalized populations.

   populations and their social networks. This study uses visual and
   textual analysis of 245 images from the websites of 17 inmate package
   companies to explore electronic commerce strategies in US penal
   institutions. The inmate package industry uses electronic commerce
   strategies that address the distinctive conditions of penal confinement
   and deploys emotionally charged messages to encourage digital
   interactions with the penal system and elicit consumption. Several
   company websites also organize the experience of consumption along
   gender and racial lines. The emergent industry of inmate packages
   represents one among several contemporary practices of carceral
   consumption.

   these clips reflect a complexity of meaning and symbolic associations
   between violence, power and masculine identities. Nevertheless,
   profoundly unequal relations of power shape their production and viewing
   appeal. The embodied and affective dimensions of marginality and poverty
   are presented in Felony Fights as evidence of the animal brutality and
   carceral character of the fighters. This resonates with populist
   explanations for criminal violence and mainstream portrayals of male
   masochism in which white men are depicted as a victimized social group.

   digital carceral systems, Asian migrant massage workers utilize
   non-digital strategies to navigate their daily lives. This research

   hampering migrants from becoming asylum seekers and getting access to
   rights. Focusing on Greece, it explores which carceral mechanisms are
   enforced and sustained through the incorporation of digital technologies
   in refugee governmentality: it contends that it is key to investigate
   the specific harms that digital technologies generate on asylum seekers.
   The article intertwines scholarship on digital technologies in migration
   governance with carceral geography literature and shows that carceral
   mechanisms are enacted also through digital technologies. The paper
   draws attention to how in Greece asylum seekers' access to the asylum
   procedure and to financial and humanitarian support is further
   obstructed due to forced technological intermediations. In the second
   part, it investigates refugees' carcerality considering the increasing
   use of technology in refugee camps and in the asylum procedures: it
   contends that carceral mechanisms enforced beyond detention and shows
   that these work by debilitating and choking refugees' lives and stealing

AB Background: Individuals released from carceral facilities have high
   rates of hospitalization and death, especially in the weeks immediately
   after their return to community settings. During this transitional
   process, individuals leaving incarceration are expected to engage with
   multiple providers working in separate, complex systems, including
   health care clinics, social service agencies, community-based
   organizations, and probation and parole services. This navigation is
   often complicated by individuals' physical and mental health, literacy
   and fluency, and socioeconomic status. Personal health information
   technology, which can help people access and organize their health
   information, could improve the transition from carceral systems to the
   community and mitigate health risks upon release. Yet, personal health
   information technologies have not been designed to meet the needs and
   preferences of this population nor tested for acceptability or
   use.Objective: The objective of our study is to develop a mobile app to
   create personal health libraries for individuals returning from
   incarceration to help bridge the transition from carceral settings to
   community living.Methods: Participants were recruited through
   Transitions Clinic Network clinic encounters and professional networking
   with justice-involved organizations. We used qualitative research
   methods to assess the facilitators and barriers to developing and using
   personal health information technology for individuals returning from
   incarceration. We conducted individual interviews with people just
   released from carceral facilities (n= similar to 20) and providers
   (n=similar to 10) from the local community and carceral facilities
   involved with the transition for returning community members. We used
   rigorous rapid qualitative analysis to generate thematic output
   characterizing the unique circumstances impacting the development and
   use of personal health information technology for individuals returning
   from incarceration and to identify content and features for the mobile
   app based on the preferences and needs of our participants.Results: As
   of February 2023, we have completed 27 qualitative interviews with
   individuals recently released from carceral systems (n=20) and
   stakeholders (n=7) who support justice-involved individuals from various
   organizations in the community.Conclusions: We anticipate that the study
   will characterize the experiences of people transitioning from prison
   and jails to community settings; describe the information, technology
   resources, and needs upon reentry to the community; and create potential
   pathways for fostering engagement with personal health information
   technology.

AB Neighborhood digital platforms - such as Nextdoor, Citizen, Neighbors,
   anti-crime Facebook groups, Ring surveillance technology, and 311
   see-click-fix applications - are recent entrants into urban life.
   Existing accounts suggest they help build intra-community relationships,
   but that they also amplify paranoia, racism, and carceral impulses of
   American homeowners. We ask: how is the new technology increasing
   solidarity and exclusionary impulses, and what role does it play in the
   changing American urban landscape? Using offline and online ethnography
   of one community's year-long contestation over public space, we find
   that three effects of the platforms help explain the maintenance of
   urban order in this case. First, the platforms push residents to see
   disparate instances of urban disorder as a linked manifestation of
   organized crime. Second, the platforms help to turn fleeting and
   uncorroborated accounts into durable events that foster community
   efficacy. Third, by increasing perceptions of urban disorder and greater
   community efficacy, the platforms facilitate the accrual of offline
   material resources. We suggest that in highly contested areas of
   American cities - areas where wealthy residents vie with a largely Brown
   and Black working-class for use of space - neighborhood digital
   platforms help to funnel services that support property value into
   smaller sections of otherwise disinvested neighborhoods.

AB This article situates the (human) body as a signifier for society at
   large, arguing that developments in many societies of structural and
   systematic violence that targets minorities such as refugees and first
   nation peoples, points to a failure of democratic values. Using two
   examples, we elaborate technology and digital devices as prosthesis of
   the body, that are also acting as proxy for state violence. The first
   example is from the carceral archipelago of Manus Island as a site of
   remote detention of refugees carried out by the Australian government.
   Refugees held on Manus Island describe the treatment they experience as
   torture. The second example is drawn from the Australian mainland,
   telling the stories of First Nations children subjected to abuse and
   violence in juvenile detention centers. A judicial inquiry (Royal
   Commission) found that a systematic approach aimed at punishing children
   constituted torture. The concepts developed in this article are those of
   bordering and racialization, while the intertwining of human and '' more
   than human life '' helps to understand and challenge the necropolitical
   power evident in (liberal) capitalism.

AB The practice of identifying people by ID numbers rather than their
   names, which the authors term here "numbering," has been extensively
   recorded in carceral and bordering institutions. While the argument for
   using identification numbers (ID numbers) is that they enable the
   reliable mapping between a person and designated institutional
   artifacts, according to people who have been subjected to numbering, its
   effect is to dehumanize, erasing individuals' identities so that they
   might be more effectively abused as objects. To explore these logics,
   our article provides a critical reading of Boat IDs in Australia's
   notorious border regime based on the first-hand accounts of people
   subjected to numbering. We apply a 'technology-in-practice' lens to
   analyze ID numbers as biopolitical apparatuses of carceral recognition
   and erasure that work to materialize power relations of domination and
   subjugation.

AB As dating apps continue to receive pressure from civil society, media
   and governments to address a range of safety concerns, technology
   companies have developed and deployed a spate of new safety features.
   Taken together, these features rely upon increased surveillance and
   partnerships with both technology start-up companies and law enforcement
   agencies proposed as responses to sexual harassment and abuse. In this
   article, we draw on empirical accounts of app use - and popular media
   reporting - to problematise commonsense assumptions about dating apps,
   safety, technology, policing and surveillance. Where so-called safety
   features involve increased surveillance and techno-carceral solutionism,
   there is potential to make users less safe - particularly for app users
   who are marginalised or stigmatised on the basis of their race,
   sexuality, gender, health status, employment or disability. Instead of
   the impetus to 'datafy' consent by documenting evidence of sexual
   transactions, or to monitor users by sharing data with police, we argue
   that a more effective approach to safety must extend the notion of
   'consent culture' to encompass a consent-based approach to collecting,
   storing, and sharing user data - including seeking consent from users
   about how and whether their data is sold, monetised or shared with third
   parties or law enforcement.

AB Globally, sex workers have highlighted the harms that accompany
   anti-prostitution efforts advanced via anti-trafficking policy, and
   there is a growing body of social science research that has emerged
   documenting how anti-trafficking efforts contribute to carceral and
   sexual humanitarian interventions. Yet mounting evidence on the harms of
   anti-trafficking policies has done little to quell the passage of more
   laws, including policies aimed at stopping sexual exploitation
   facilitated by technology. The 2018 passage of the Allow States and
   Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the U.S. House of
   Representatives, and the corresponding Senate bill, the Stop Enabling
   Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), is a case study in how efforts to curb
   sexual exploitation online actually heighten vulnerabilities for the
   people they purport to protect. Drawing on 34 months of ethnographic
   fieldwork and interviews with sex workers and trafficked persons (n =
   58) and key informants (n = 20) in New York and Los Angeles, we analyze
   FOSTA/SESTA and its harmful effects as a launchpad to more broadly
   explore how technology, criminalization, shifting governance
   arrangements, and conservative moralities cohere to exacerbate sex
   workers' vulnerability.

AB The rise of neuroplasticity has led to new fields of study about the
   relation between social inequalities and neurobiology, including
   investigations into the "neuroscience of poverty." The neural phenotype
   of poverty proposed in recent neuroscientific research emerges out of
   classed, gendered, and racialized inequalities that not only affect
   bodies in material ways but also shape scientific understandings of
   difference. An intersectional, sociomaterial approach is needed to grasp
   the implications of neuroscientific research that aims to both produce
   and repair neurobiological difference. Following Benjamin's critique of
   the "carceral imagination" of technoscience, this article considers how
   such research may fix in terms of helping, or in contrast, fix by
   classifying and reifying, vulnerable subjects. I address the potential
   for biosocial determinism in linking neural phenotypes and social
   problems. I use an intersectional approach to consider the presence and
   absence of race in this body of research and explore how some
   methodological and conceptual framings of the "brain on poverty" mark
   poor and minority children for intervention in concert with neoliberal
   approaches to poverty.

AB Metal detectors became ubiquitous throughout the United States after
   their use in airports during the late-1960s and early 1970s when they
   were installed to address hijackings. While earlier perceptions of the
   technology's invasiveness prevented the metal detector's deployment in
   the United States beyond jails and prisons, security officials came to
   identify the device as a means to address the carceral-security state's
   legitimacy crises and square mass surveillance with demands for civil
   and political rights. Those designing and implementing the first airport
   security program understood hijackings as elements of global rebellions
   against U.S. empire and drew from policing efforts at home and abroad in
   their efforts to securitize airports. Officials and courts argued that
   the universality and objectivity of the machine that determined
   potential danger solely through the presence of metal removed individual
   police discretion and was thus race-neutral. Claims of the technology's
   novelty not only obscured its carceral and counterinsurgent origins but
   helped propel the metal detector's deployment to new spaces including
   public schools and workplaces. The metal detector reproduced existing
   class and racial hierarchies and strengthened police discretionary
   authority.

AB How should society respond to police surveillance technologies? This
   question has been at the center of national debates around facial
   recognition, predictive policing, and digital tracking technologies. It
   is a debate that has divided activists, law enforcement officials, and
   academics and will be a central question for years to come as police
   surveillance technology grows in scale and scope. Do you trust police to
   use the technology without regulation? Do you ban surveillance
   technology as a manifestation of discriminatory carceral power that
   cannot be reformed? Can you regulate police surveillance with a
   combination of technocratic rules, policies, audits, and legal reforms?
   This Article explores the taxonomy of past approaches to policing
   technologies and-finding them all lacking-offers the "tyrant test" as an
   alternative.
   The tyrant test focuses on power. Because surveillance technology offers
   government a new power to monitor and control citizens, the response
   must check that power. The question is how, and the answer is to assume
   the worst. Power will be abused, and constraints must work backwards
   from that cynical starting point. The tyrant test requires institutional
   checks that decenter government power into overlapping community
   institutions with real authority and enforceable individual rights.
   The tyrant test borrows its structure from an existing legal framework
   also designed to address the rise of a potentially tyrannical power-the
   U.S. Constitution and, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment. Fearful
   of a centralized federal government with privacy invading intentions,
   the Fourth Amendment-as metaphor and methodology-offers a guide to
   approaching surveillance; it allows some technologies but only within a
   self-reinforcing system of structural checks and balances with power
   centered in opposition to government. The fear of tyrannical power
   motivated the original Fourth Amendment and still offers lessons for how
   society should address the growth of powerful, new surveillance
   technologies.

AB Background: This research aimed to provide young people in a juvenile
   rehabilitation centre (JRC) with access and exposure to virtual reality
   (VR) as a growing media technology industry, to offer media education
   that was fun and engaging, and to introduce the digital arts to
   participants as a potential career path. The project evolved through a
   partnership with the Washington State Librarian who, as a part of her
   role overseeing public library activities, wanted to ensure that newly
   acquired VR equipment was made available to as many people as possible.
   This effort included libraries within sites of incarceration. Analysis:
   This article presents a reflective and analytical discussion on the
   success and challenges of creating, implementing, and researching a VR
   art design program in a JRC. Conclusions and implications: Carceral
   logics are entangled in research and education, in constant tension with
   anti-oppressive methods in place. Improvisational action as a design
   method in media education programs, including VR art design with
   incarcerated youth, may support greater participation and stronger
   research outcomes.

AB The 1946 Bataan Rice Enrichment Project illuminates the intimate
   connections between Euro-American empire, scientific nationalism, and
   post-war demonstration in the Philippines. The project was conducted by
   former American colonial chemist turned philanthropist Robert R.
   Williams, who sought to prove the efficacy of synthetic-thiamine
   fortified rice in the fight against beriberi. Yet by willfully exposing
   half of Bataan's food scarce residents to beriberi, Williams effectively
   recreated the prisons and asylums that Euro-American researchers had
   used as living laboratories to induce beriberi in unwilling subjects.
   These 'carceral laboratories' were highly contested by the people
   imprisoned within and by nationalist Philippine physicians who
   understood deficiency disease as a symptom of colonialism. Returning the
   carceral laboratory to the making of nutritional science explains the
   post-war Philippine rejection of mandatory rice fortification and is a
   reminder that the Asian countryside was a creation of colonial modernity
   and a contested space long before the Cold War.

AB Theorizing situates bystander intervention approaches to combatting
   street sexual harassment as either an anti-carceral mode of social
   justice concerned with citizen responsibility and reshaping community
   norms or a carceral practice that shifts forms and sites of penal power.
   This article examines the intersection and effect of carceral and
   anti-carceral framing techniques in the 2015 "The Harasser is a
   Criminal" media campaign deployed by the Egyptian anti-sexual harassment
   initiative HarassMap to promote bystander intervention. Situated within
   a sphere of Egyptian gender activism that is transnational, secular, and
   feminist-oriented, and operating within a militarized, authoritarian
   political context, HarassMap's campaign complicates how bystander
   intervention is instrumentalized as a technology of power to shape
   subjective and intersubjective responses to Egypt's street sexual
   harassment problem. Carceral and anti-carceral currents flow together in
   their campaign not to promote a reliance on police or juridical
   structures for redress, but to cultivate new ethical dispositions as a
   means of mobilizing individuals to act. Through the figure of the
   bystander, HarassMap is engaged in a biopolitical project which seeks to
   create new neoliberal subjects who police themselves and assume
   responsibility for their own behavior in public space.

AB Technofixes that promise to improve racism in the prison industrial
   complex (PIC) frequently perpetuate it instead. This article argues that
   carceral technofixes undermine their promises when they attempt to solve
   social problems by pacifying the people that these problems affect. It
   offers a reading of physicist Alvin Weinberg's writings on technofixes,
   which, he believed, could improve social problems better than people
   because they appeared objective. This appearance emerged through the
   process of scientific reduction, which simplifies social complexity to
   help designers identify symptoms of problems amenable to technological
   intervention. This article claims that scientific reduction orients
   technofixes to make systemic power in the PIC invisible and to silence
   radical calls for system reform. I explore these tendencies through two
   examples: (1) Weinberg's hypothesis that air conditioning could prevent
   Black uprisings in the 1960s and (2) the COMPAS recidivism algorithm at
   use in Florida today, which attempts to pacify critics of the PIC by
   framing the subjective assessments of judges as the source of racist
   sentencing disparities. The article also shows how COMPAS limited
   radical critiques of the PIC even after it reproduced racist sentencing
   disparities as it directed the conversation of algorithmic racism around
   questions of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and accountability.

AB The social movement for #PoliceFreeSchools (and the adjacent campaign on
   college and university campuses called #PoliceFreeCampuses) welcomes an
   opportunity to reimagine school discipline and safety in
   contradistinction to current carceral forms. Scholars have moved away
   from notions of "school to prison pipeline" by demonstrating the many
   ways schools are organized as carceral spaces (e.g., school-prison
   nexus). A conceptual framework of Anti-carceral leadership is put
   forward in this paper to underscore the need for a leadership paradigm
   that actively refuses the logics of the carceral state (e.g., social
   control). The paper underscores how the logics of antiblackness may
   sustain mechanisms of social control in education policy intended to
   undo racialized harm. The tensions of be(com)ing an anti-carceral leader
   and its significance for undoing technologies of punishment,
   confinement, and constraint that reinforce schooling as a site of Black
   pain and suffering are discussed.

AB Critical social science research on conservation practice has long
   articulated the tactics that emerge out of a history of carcerality,
   environmental racism, colonialism, and violence against oppressed
   peoples. Despite these critiques, there has been little change in how
   conservation is conceptualised and implemented, resulting in the
   continuation of violence, racism, and injustice. Abolition ecologies
   offer a framework to see the world through a carceral lens and imagine
   an abolitionist future for conservation. Using Kenya as a case study, we
   outline the three ways that carcerality is apparent in and integral to
   contemporary conservation practices: legal/juridical, technoscience, and
   privatisation. Illuminating the carcerality of conservation practices,
   we posit, allows scholars and practitioners to begin to imagine and work
   towards a more just and liberatory conservation movement, one that
   minimises the perpetuation and reproduction of white supremacy,
   violence, and environmental injustice.

AB In the current study, we explored the prison design and infrastructural
   changes that Canadian correctional officers consider to be essential in
   the construction of a new provincial correctional institution intended
   to replace Her Majesty's Penitentiary (HMP) in the Canadian province of
   Newfoundland and Labrador. Analyzing 28 semi-structured interviews
   conducted with correctional officers employed at HMP, we found the poor
   working conditions within HMP are, at least in part, related to the
   physical design of the prison, including inadequate lighting, poor air
   quality and temperature, high sound levels, and other spatial
   limitations. Building on the prison design literature, findings suggest
   that while prison design requires attention to physical security at the
   forefront, there are ways to improve the space, recognizing how an
   uncomfortable workplace and living conditions also pose a potential
   threat to the well-being and safety of correctional officers and people
   who are incarcerated.
   Dans cette & eacute;tude, nous explorons l'am & eacute;nagement et

   analysant les 28 entrevues semi-structur & eacute;es men & eacute;es
   avec des agents correctionnels employ & eacute;s au HMP, nous avons
   constat & eacute; que les mauvaises conditions de travail sont, au moins
   en partie, caus & eacute;es par les caract & eacute;ristiques d'am &
   eacute;nagement de la prison, notamment un & eacute;clairage inad &

   implique une attention prioritaire & agrave; la s & eacute;curit &

   Correctional officers at HMP believe poor working conditions within the
   prison in part are affected by the physical design of the prison. Safety
   for both officers and prisoners is at risk due to infrastructure,
   technology, and air quality issues within the prison. Carceral space,
   particularly the physical design of a prison, should contribute to the
   well-being of all its occupants, prisoner or staff.

AB In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officially launched
   its online locator system, an internet-based public tool designed to
   assist attorneys, family members, and interested entities in locating
   detained individuals in ICE custody. In November 2019, Freedom For
   Immigrants (FFI), an immigrant rights organization, conducted surveys of
   individuals and organizations attempting to locate detainees and found
   698 instances of migrants disappearing from the online locator system,
   with the search stating "zero matching records." With this in mind, this
   essay explores technologies of invisibility of the carceral web through
   ethnographic observation and testimonies collected in immigration
   detention. I use the term "carceral web" by Susila Gurusami to refer to
   the spatial intersection between carceral institutions and digital
   technologies that unveil the entanglements and workings of the carceral
   edgelands. I argue that the ICE locator system, a public tool for
   migrant identification and placement, not only showcases state-enforced
   disappearance but reveals a process of invisibilization and structural
   violence temporally and spatially at work.

AB This article argues that classical Hollywood prison films narrativise
   sound towards counter-carceral ends. Building on sound's uniquely fluid
   relationship to the penitentiary's hard spatial boundaries, it finds
   that prison films of the classical Hollywood era are full of inmate
   characters who deploy sound strategies and sound technologies to
   protest, oppose, or escape from carceral systems.Structured around case
   studies of Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and Caged! (1950), films in
   which sound plays a critical narrative function, the article develops
   the work of film and media scholars who have emphasised film sound's
   ability to draw the spectator into a phenomenological/affectual
   relationship with imprisoned characters. However, by shifting focus from
   affect and experience to narrative and resistance, this investigation
   also engages current developments in the study of prison sound in
   theoretical criminology and carceral abolitionist scholarship. This
   literature encourages a pursuit of how prison films may depict convicts
   enacting 'counter-carceral acoustemologies'. This leads the article to
   posit that sound is not only an avenue for audiences to experience the
   acoustics of imprisonment but a narrative and political tool that can be
   used by prisoners (real or fictional) against imprisonment.

AB This article explores the use of smuggled digital technologies by
   prisoners in Lebanese carceral spaces. Since 2012, prisoners have
   smuggled cellphones to document and share their experiences and
   protests, despite efforts by authorities to restrict this access. The
   study adopts Mart & iacute;n-Barbero's mediaciones and Mattoni's
   activist media practices, to propose "prison media mobilization"-the
   strategic and illicit reconfiguration of digital technologies by
   prisoners to subvert constraints and amplify dissent. The analysis
   focuses on four approaches: representation, production, circulation, and
   material practices. By examining recordings and contextual information
   from significant events in Lebanese prisons, the research shows how
   contraband digital technologies catalyze mobilizations. These
   technologies document, incite, propagate, and aid prisoners perform acts
   of defiance against prison conditions. The study highlights the
   complexity and innovation in prisoners' media practices, calling for a
   comprehensive framework to understand media mobilizations in carceral
   spaces.

AB The United States has one of the highest incarceration rates in the
   world, with approximately 1.7 million individuals detained in jails or
   federal or state prisons. Chronic medical conditions are more prevalent
   among adults in custody than among their nonincarcerated counterparts,
   resulting in needs that often surpass the on-site medical treatment
   capabilities of carceral facilities. For this reason, many
   community-based health care professionals will encounter incarcerated
   patients in an ambulatory or inpatient setting. Yet, although carceral
   status engenders pragmatic and ethical complexities in patient care,
   health care professionals in academic and community settings receive
   little or no education about correctional health. This special article
   seeks to address this knowledge gap by providing demographic and patient
   characteristics of this population, describing health care delivery in
   the criminal legal system, summarizing incarcerated patients' health
   care rights, conveying the current state of oversight and regulation for
   correctional health care, and presenting the role of health care
   professionals in advocating for the ethical care of incarcerated
   patients. By equipping themselves with this knowledge, clinicians may
   provide holistic and ethical care for persons involved in the criminal
   legal system. (c) 2024 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and

AB We theorize state governance through population spatial trajectories to
   capture how seemingly disparate systems of punishment employ the same
   set of punishment logics and technologies to spatially regulate
   populations of color, which produces and reifies racial projects.
   Advancing a theoretical framework called carceral migrations, we argue
   that governments use legal punishment to force, restrict, and prevent
   movement as a racializing project of settler empire and anti-Blackness.
   Carceral migrations extend understandings of mass incarceration beyond
   confinement and holding by articulating three major points. First, the
   state's regulation of populations' spatial trajectories is punishment by
   design. Second, these spatially-oriented punishments operate as
   race-making and reinforcing technologies by producing punitive and
   recognizable spatial trajectories (or nontrajectories) for groups of
   people of color. Third, despite appearing race neutral in language, the
   development and application of legal codes and policies have disparate
   impacts on the spatial trajectories of people of color.

AB In this article, we focus on the agro-environmental dimensions of
   plantation agriculture in the U.S. South, examining the ways carceral
   relations constrain foodways through the interrelated control of human
   and non-human life, the racialized monopolization of land, and the
   production of hunger. Through a focus on the chemicalization of cotton
   plantation agriculture and the transformation of chicken to poultry, we
   show how the racialized control of life and labor has been extended
   temporally and spatially by means of agricultural technologies. In the
   decades following the abolition of slavery, white landowners enrolled
   legal structures of racialized coercion and agricultural technologies in
   the service of continued plantation production. Combining archival and
   ethnographic methods, we trace these dynamics in cotton and poultry
   production in the 20th century, we show how technologies putatively
   oriented toward agricultural "productivity" extended the carceral
   dynamics of prisons through agro-environmental racism, the control of
   land and labor, and the production of hunger. Cotton chemicals and
   poultry plant speedups, we argue, represent racial and spatial relations
   of material and ideological control and containment that displace
   nourishing and liberatory ways of living and relating.

AB Prisons are on the cusp of a technological transformation as
   twenty-first-century digital connectivity in 'free' society permeates
   prison design and offender management. This article will begin with an
   overview of the digital technologies in 'smart' prisons. Two limbs are
   emerging: technologies that are embedded into the infrastructure of
   prisons to benefit authorities through heightened security, and
   technologies that may benefit prisoners by providing them with positive
   opportunities to access justice, maintain family relationships and
   engage in programs aimed at optimising their post-release circumstances
   and rehabilitation. However, recent case law paints a picture of prison
   life devoid of human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing
   isolation and heightened anxiety. Through the lens of emergent
   conceptions of digital criminology, this article will analyse Australian
   case law to examine whether the automated, smart or digital prison
   offers a utopian vision of safe detention and rehabilitation or a
   dehumanised and punitive dystopia.

   attention on the role of communication in mass incarceration's
   racialized, criminal justice process. To argue that a communication
   perspective helps explain how individuals, neighborhoods, and prisons
   are linked together, the article uses publicly available indictments
   that charged three New York City youth gangs with violent crimes. It
   identifies three facets of carceral communication to demonstrate how and
   why mass incarceration is a communicative phenomenon. First,
   computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become the most sought-after
   type of criminal evidence because of its visibility and permanence.
   Second, law enforcement uses the interpersonal communication and
   neighborhood networks of incarcerated Black men for crime control and
   surveillance purposes. Third, carceral communication operates as a
   communication feedback process, in which marginalized, young, Black men
   under surveillance know they are being watched and respond to that
   surveillance with resistance that is also subject to criminalization.

AB This study looks into Paul Beatty's 2016 Man Booker Prize winning novel
   The Sellout (2015) as a powerful literary elaboration on the politics of
   racial identity. In naturalizing slavery and segregation in current U.S.
   society-the idea at the core of The Sellout-Beatty deploys racism along
   a continuum from the past to the present, rather than something in the
   past or a memory in the contemporary so-called post-racial world. The
   present analysis examines how the literary devices of parody and
   allegory assist in the creation of a satire, particularly of the U.S.
   carceral system. The fictional events at Dickens, as well as Bonbon Me's
   story, it is argued, are only the first layer of signification in a plot
   that allegorizes what is perhaps the most racialized criminal system in
   the world, one that several critics see as the most efficient apparatus
   of social control after Jim Crow. Through a second layer of meaning, the
   most controversial representations in the novel, namely slavery and
   segregation, are explored. The signs of parody in his use of hyperbole
   and stereotype, are also marks of a black post-blackness critique that
   registers Beatty's literary voice in the current debate on 'blackness'
   as identity.

AB While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery everywhere,
   persons with carceral system involvement and opioid use disorder (OUD)
   were disproportionately impacted and vulnerable to severe
   COVID-associated illness. Carceral settings and community treatment
   programs (CTPs) rapidly developed protocols to sustain healthcare
   delivery while reducing risk of COVID-19 transmission. This survey study
   assessed changes to OUD treatment, telemedicine use, and re-entry
   support services among carceral and CTPs participating in the National
   Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded study, Long-Acting Buprenorphine
   vs. Naltrexone Opioid Treatments in Criminal Justice System-Involved
   Adults (EXIT-CJS) study. In December 2020, carceral sites (n = 6; median
   pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 3468 people) and CTPs (n = 7; median
   pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 550 patients) participating in EXIT-CJS
   completed a cross-sectional web-based survey. The survey assessed
   changes pre- (January-March 2020) and post- (April-September 2020)
   COVID-19 in OUD treatment, telemedicine use, re-entry supports and
   referral practices. Compared to January-March 2020, half of carceral
   sites (n = 3) increased the total number of persons initiating
   medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) from April-September 2020,
   while a third (n = 2) decreased the number of persons initiated. Most
   CTPs (n = 4) reported a decrease in the number of new admissions from
   April-September 2020, with two programs stopping or pausing MOUD
   programs due to COVID-19. All carceral sites with pre-COVID telemedicine
   use (n = 5) increased or maintained telemedicine use, and all CTPs
   providing MOUD (n = 6) increased telemedicine use. While expansion of
   telemedicine services supported MOUD service delivery, the majority of
   sites experienced challenges providing community support post-release,
   including referrals to housing, employment, and transportation services.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic, this small sample of carceral and CTP
   sites innovated to continue delivery of treatment for OUD. Expansion of
   telemedicine services was critical to support MOUD service delivery.
   Despite these innovations, sites experienced challenges providing
   reintegration supports for persons in the community. Pre-COVID
   strategies for identifying and engaging individuals while incarcerated
   may be less effective since the pandemic. In addition to expanding
   research on the most effective telemedicine practices for carceral
   settings, research exploring strategies to expand housing and employment
   support during reintegration are critical.

AB Refugee camps are among the most prevalent institutional responses to
   global displacement. Despite a quasi consensus among scholars,
   activists, and humanitarians that camps are undesirable, and should only
   ever be temporary, little work has charted the political project and
   practices of camp abolition that challenge their spatial unfreedom.
   Rather than life-supporting spatial technologies of care that
   unwittingly signal political failures of inclusion, camps form part of a
   calculated system of "carceral humanitarianism". This article draws on
   experiences from Kenya where aid interventions have shaped politics,
   social dynamics and economic life since the 1990s. Kakuma camp and
   Kalobeyei settlement serve as empirical windows to explore the limits of
   institutional decampment and reform policies, while demonstrating that
   more radical, abolitionist struggles are enacted through everyday
   mobilisation and acts of fugitivity among refugees themselves. Advancing
   critical studies of humanitarianism and forced migration, this article
   contends that only abolishing camps and their carceral logics helps to
   build more viable, safe, and humane futures for people on the move.

AB This article explores the phenomenon of "carceral accuracy" in order to
   index how minoritarian participation into state antiviolence measures
   continues to reproduce and prioritize social scientific, criminological,
   and quantitative data-driven efforts to rationalize crime and punishment
   as a necessity for disrupting bias-motivated violence. In Los Angeles
   from 2014 to 2015, in the span of just five months the premature and
   violent deaths of three transgender women of color would exacerbate
   longstanding political rifts in the trans and queer community. These
   rifts formed along the lines of either divestment or reinvestment in
   criminal policy and legislation via a call for prosecution of
   "anti-trans hate crimes." Considering that over the last four decades
   Los Angeles has been lauded for its progressive LGBT policies and
   inclusive policing reforms, this article traces how trans and queer
   community safety agendas have become so easily conflated with policing
   and imprisonment technologies that presume to speculate, track, manage,
   and inoculate social risk. Focusing on examples such as former LAPD (Los
   Angeles Police Department) Chief Charlie Beck's 2012 LGBT Police Forum
   proclamation of a "transgender progressive paramilitarism" to the LAPD's
   2015 "Transgender Walk of Remembrance," these instances of "trans
   inclusive" pro-policing efforts demonstrate how antiviolence coalitions
   remain tied to carceral outcomes by way of routinized and compulsory
   participation in criminological discourse and technologies cloaked in
   the rhetoric of public safety. In conclusion, this article asks how
   carceral coalitions are maintained through law enforcement agencies'
   control of select community partnerships that prioritize how we count
   crime and who is represented in crime data. Carceral accuracy thus
   wrestles with the shared cultural preoccupation with upholding a mythos
   that "cold calculations," such as the counting of trans deaths, can
   provide any relief or disruption to anti-trans violence. In the end,
   what remains unshakeable in the wake of such violence is a
   heteropatriarchal and white supremacist possessive investment in
   improving criminal data.

AB In May 2019, 75 distressed migrants fleeing Libya were rescued by the
   merchant vessel Maridive 601 in the central Mediterranean Sea. With
   Italy, Malta, and Tunisia denying permission to disembark, the merchant
   vessel turned from a floating refuge into an offshore carceral space,
   leaving the migrants stranded near the Tunisian coast for 19 days. This
   article traces the migratory trajectories of the Maridive 75, as I will
   collectively refer to them, in order to show how EUrope's desire to
   deter, capture, and contain migrant mobilities has transformed the
   Mediterranean Sea into a carceral seascape. While offshore carcerality
   is not specific to EUrope's southern maritime border and also not a
   novel phenomenon, increasingly restrictive migration policies have
   dramatically reshaped the Mediterranean borderzone over recent years,
   multiplying infrastructures, technologies, and spaces of confinement.
   Interrogating the Mediterranean Sea as a carceral space generates
   insights into an ever-growing panoply of carceral but mobile forms of
   governance seeking to discipline and police unauthorised and precarious
   human movements, both at sea and on land. At the same time, as this
   article demonstrates, unruly migrant mobilities and struggles at sea
   continue to expose the often-conflictual processes at work in the
   production of the Mediterranean carceral seascape.

AB This article argues that criminal justice and health institutions under
   settler colonialism collude to create and sustain "truths" about First
   Nations lives that often render them as "bare life," to use the term of
   Giorgio Agamben (1998). First Nations peoples' existence is stripped to
   its sheer biological fact of life and their humanity denied rights and
   dignity. First Nations people remain in a "state of exception" to the
   legal order and its standards of care (Agamben 1998). Zones of exception
   place First Nations people in a separate and diminished legal order.
   Medical and health agencies have been instrumental in shaping colonial
   "biopower," both in and beyond carceral settings to ensure that First
   Nations lives are managed in accordance with the colonial settler state
   project. This project is able both to threaten First Nations rights to
   live and to maintain settler self-perceptions of decency and care. We
   illustrate this discussion with reference to the tragic and unnecessary
   deaths in custody of twenty-two-year-old Yamatji woman Ms Dhu in 2014 in
   South Hedland Police Station, Western Australia, and twenty-six-year-old
   Dunghutti man David Dungay Jnr in Long Bay jail in Sydney, NSW, in 2015.
   Health professionals and police demonstrated callous disregard to Ms Dhu
   and Mr Dungay-treating them as "bare life."

   is an attempt to piece together various pieces of literature that offer
   theoretical explorations of mass incarceration, as well as, how
   punishment and the logics of prison have informed economic, political,

AB This article discusses findings from an ethnographic study of a bail and
   remand court in Victoria, Australia. Through a focus on the sensory
   dimensions of forced movements within and through the bail court, the
   article contributes to the burgeoning sub-field of sensory criminology
   and develops the concept of 'carceral churn'. The article argues that
   the bail court's churn reproduces criminal and carceral subjects and is
   implicated in a project of carceral buildup. The churn of the bail court
   involves forms of mobility and exchange via the inter- and
   intra-carceral spaces that variously dull, distort, deprive or assault
   the senses with oppressive effects. This includes both 'new' and 'old'
   penal technologies such as holding cells, the custody dock, AV links and
   court-prison transport. The analysis of sensory violence challenges the
   notion that court 'efficiency' can improve justice experiences and
   outcomes and instead calls for increased attention to the harms and
   lethality that flow from carceral churn left un-checked.

AB This article asks: How do formerly incarcerated people navigate digital
   technologies? Using the metaphor of a spider web, I use 18 months of
   ethnographic observations of formerly incarcerated women of color to
   argue that formerly incarcerated people must contend with what I
   call-Carceral Web-the spatial intersection between carceral institutions
   and digital technologies. I identify two primary features of the
   Carceral Web: stickiness and entanglements. I characterize stickiness as
   the Internet's ability to make carceral histories inescapable across
   time and physical space, making it impossible for formerly incarcerated
   people to shed their criminal histories. I characterize entanglements as
   the intersections of institutional carceral relationships that result
   from practices and norms of digital connectivity. I argue that the
   pervasive significance of digital connectivity to everyday life compels
   formerly incarcerated people to contend with the Carceral Web, but
   stickiness and entanglements make them susceptible to exploitation and
   reincarceration. I call the Carceral Web's production of vulnerable
   subjects predation, which I characterize as a type of hidden sentence. I
   contend that despite having limited resources to navigate predation,
   formerly incarcerated people are tasked with co-opting the Carceral Web
   to build solidarity and training as a self-defense survival mechanism.
   Understanding the Spider of the Carceral Web as the convergence of
   corporations and state interests allows us to see how it feeds on the
   lives of formerly incarcerated people by consuming their marginalization
   and exclusion in the interests of racialized and gendered profit.

AB Background Correctional systems in several U.S. states have entered into
   partnerships with Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) to provide healthcare
   for people who are incarcerated. This project was initiated to better
   understand medical trainee perspectives on training and providing
   healthcare services to prison populations at one AMC specializing in the
   care of incarcerated patients: The University of Texas Medical Branch at
   Galveston (UTMB). We set out to characterize the attitudes and
   perceptions of medical trainees from the start of their training until
   the final year of Internal Medicine residency. Our goal was to analyze
   medical trainee perspectives on caring for incarcerated patients and to
   determine what specialized education and training is needed, if any, for
   the provision of ethical and appropriate healthcare to incarcerated
   patients. Results We found that medical trainees grapple with being
   beneficiaries of a state and institutional power structure that exploits
   the neglected health of incarcerated patients for the benefit of medical
   education and research. The benefits include the training opportunities
   afforded by the advanced pathologies suffered by persons who are
   incarcerated, an institutional culture that generally allowed students
   more freedom to practice their skills on incarcerated patients as
   compared to free-world patients, and an easy compliance of incarcerated
   patients likely conditioned by their neglect. Most trainees failed to
   recognize the extreme power differential between provider and patient
   that facilitates such freedom. Conclusions Using a critical prison
   studies/Foucauldian theoretical framework, we identified how the
   provision/withholding of healthcare to and from persons who are
   incarcerated plays a major role in disciplining incarcerated bodies into
   becoming compliant medical patients and research subjects, complacent
   with and even grateful for delayed care, delivered sometimes below the
   standard best practices. Specialized vulnerable-population training is
   sorely needed for both medical trainees and attending physicians in
   order to not further contribute to this exploitation of incarcerated
   patients.

AB Policing and incarceration are feminist issues that stand to be
   interrogated through examinations of carceral practices. This essay
   positions the management and withholding of information and the
   observation of communications as instances of carceral specific
   practices that shape possibilities for incarcerated people and their
   communities. The author draws from their experience as a librarian in
   carceral facilities to outline how State-enacted violence occurs through
   the regulation and management of information access. As carceral
   facilities utilize third-party ICT providers, it is difficult to
   ascertain what information is or is not available. The introduction of
   new and evolving ICTs has led to increased opportunities for the State
   to monitor people who are incarcerated and their communities,
   positioning incarcerated people and their networks not only as sources
   of information but as data to train technologies of policing and
   surveillance. Instances of resistance to these practices reveal some
   ways that people who are not incarcerated can act in solidarity with
   people who are incarcerated and people who are subject to State
   surveillance.

AB Australia's offshore immigration detention centers are characterized by
   a culture of secrecy that keeps human rights abuses hidden. Yet,
   detainees are employing new technologies and media to narrate their
   experiences of incarceration. This article examines the potentials and
   limitations of bearing witness and exercising acoustic agency through
   podcasting. It provides a case study of The Messenger podcast in which a
   refugee detained on Manus Island exchanges voice messages with an
   Australian journalist. It finds that podcasting can breach the secrecy
   that sustains a punitive detention regime and evoke empathy in listeners
   through the affective nature of voice. However, podcasting is limited by
   the sense of distance produced by prerecorded and edited sound and by
   the risk of creating echo chambers through the selective nature of
   podcast consumption. Finally, we adapt, develop, and argue for the
   concept of earwitnessing as a practice of responsible and political
   listening to injustice.

AB This article is the guest editor's introduction to a special issue of
   Pacific Historical Review titled "The Carceral West." Whereas
   scholarship on the carceral state has traditionally focused on the U.S.
   South, the urban North, and post-war Los Angeles, scholars have more
   recently begun to focus on the long history of incarceration throughout
   the U.S. West. The West provides a rich environment for examining the
   carceral state, especially as it relates to race and immigration.
   Additional articles in this special issue include Elliott Young on
   immigrant incarceration at McNeil Federal Penitentiary between 1880 and
   1930, Benjamin Madley interpreting the Spanish Mission system as a
   carceral regime, and Mary Mendoza examining the U.S.-Mexico border fence
   as a carceral environment that locks undocumented immigrants both in and
   out.

AB Bureaucracy, the governing legacy of the expanse of European
   colonialism, has come to be the dominating means by which states relate
   to their citizens; also through which they relate to other states.
   Analysing geographies of evil from within a post-colonial world system
   perspective, it becomes possible to see the creation of carceral
   geographies - literal prison states - created to control and manage
   populations inconvenient to or unwanted by the state. Deemed always
   already criminal, the unwanted are submitted to the technologies of
   control that have come to be associated most closely with the prison -
   with checkpoints, with constant suspicion that they are planning some
   malevolent behaviour, forbidden from entering certain areas of the
   state, forced to prove their own innocence in the face of presumed
   guilt, and often literally caged in by geographies designed to recreate
   the architecture of the prison. I contend that such systems are capable
   of being upheld through the banality of bureaucracy. The purpose of this
   piece is to first attempt a deconstruction of the notion of a banal
   bureaucracy and its role in the creation and maintenance of carceral
   geographies, and second to add to the growing literature on anthropology
   of the state through incorporated comparisons between individual
   carceral circumstances and a wider capitalist pattern of power.

AB Mass incarceration maps onto global neoliberal carceral formations that,
   in turn, look very much like a visual iconography of social suffering.
   Camp or prison-like conditions define the daily life of many of the
   world's inhabitants caught in contexts of detention, incarceration,
   forced migration, and population displacement. Often depicted as abject
   subjects, actors in carceral contexts and the people who organize with
   them seek to find strategies of representation that humanize and
   politicize their existence. This essay attempts to gain a sense of the
   visual struggles at the heart of these carceral scenes by way of an
   analysis of the use of images and new media by current and former
   prisoners, community members, artists, and scholars to counter mass
   incarceration in the United States. Such scenes are significant sites
   for examining how a visual criminology might reveal and participate in
   the contestations and interventions that increasingly challenge the
   project of mass incarceration.

AB Recent discussions on technology and gender-violence prevention
   emphasize that technoscientific applications often advance
   pro-punishment logics that enact gendered inequalities. Less attention
   has focused on racialized dimensions and how technology might advance
   abolitionist and transformative justice agendas. In response, this
   article considers how inventors mobilize technology as a frontline
   response to sexual violence, in which technoscience-rather than
   police-enables individuals, friends, and family to provide safety and
   mutual aid. Through analysis of seven popular technologies produced
   between 2010 and 2020, this paper documents how their "abolitionist
   sensibility" is accompanied by fellow-traveler discourses that are
   unattuned to intersecting power relations. Findings suggest that while
   this sociotechnical imaginary is reacting to state power, it reinforces
   a race-neutral and techno-optimistic vision for building a violence-free
   future. These power-evasive politics may thus signal increased
   susceptibility to carceral creep and coercive surveillant regimes. After
   discussing these double-edge politics, I conclude by discussing power
   formations that are left unexamined in the imaginary and how to
   cultivate a counter-carceral praxis in line with transformative justice
   goals.

AB Since the COVID-19 pandemic forced prisons into extended lockdowns,
   people-in-prison have been increasingly reliant on remote access
   technologies such as videoconferencing to interact with the outside
   world from their carceral context. During the pandemic, both corrective
   services and criminal courts found that these communication technologies
   could adequately facilitate court appearances, legal conferencing,
   health services and visitations. Now, despite the lessening panic
   regarding COVID-19, there are suggestions that authorities are keen to
   continue, if not increase, the usage of videolinks meaning that
   people-in-prison will experience decreasing human contact. The argument
   is that COVID-19 "successes" are being used as an excuse to cement
   remote hearings and visits. This points to a future of absolute
   confinement uninterrupted by "inconvenient" physical court attendance or
   human visitors. This article will focus on the "digital vulnerability"
   of people-in-prison, that is, the intersection between the
   vulnerabilities of incarcerated people with the use of remote
   communication technologies such as videoconferencing or videolinks, and
   the digital inequalities that may be provoked or solved. The article
   will draw on qualitative research - fieldwork interviews with judicial
   officers, lawyers and associated criminal justice professionals - that
   reveal critical perspectives on the impacts of digital transformation on
   vulnerable people-in-prison. For instance, when asked about the
   vulnerabilities of people-in-prison, one defence lawyer (DL1) expressed
   the view that "no one cares about defendants" or their vulnerabilities,
   nor their abilities to engage with videolinks, comprehend or play any
   role in their own remote legal matters. We analyse our source materials
   through a framework of vulnerability theory and the developing concept
   of digital vulnerability. In this way, we seek to offer new knowledge
   regarding prison digital transformation, specifically the relationship
   between digital technologies in correctional environments and the
   vulnerable incarcerated population.

AB Why is the police role so broad in the United States today? Carceral
   state scholars have investigated how and why policymakers have treated
   so many social problems as policing problems, but they have not yet
   recognized the degree to which the call-for-service system has
   marginalized political control over police strategy. This Article traces
   the historical sources of this arrangement through extensive archival
   research into its evolution. We find that over the course of the
   twentieth century, the rise of new communications technologies gradually
   shifted the power to decide which problems are proper subjects of police
   attention to private individuals, eventually channeling their demands
   through centralized call centers that had been stripped of the authority
   and contextual knowledge needed to govern them in a meaningful way. That
   process fundamentally altered the character of public oversight over
   policing, elevating a distinctive set of individual interests as largely
   unchallenged determinants of the kinds of situations that are
   policeable. By illustrating how sociotechnical change unintentionally
   reallocated the authority to define the scope of an important
   institution's mandate, this case sheds new light on the factors that
   shape the police role and the role the public plays in defining it.

AB In this article, we argue that Direct Provision in Ireland is a state
   approved form of gendered carcerality which creates and exacerbates
   conditions of gendered violence. Direct Provision is a system of
   processing asylum seekers in Ireland where they are temporarily provided
   accommodation while they wait for a decision on their refugee status
   claim. This article shows how carceral practices are layered and
   gendered, making some spaces and bodies more carceral than others. These
   carceralities increase the institutional burden which agglomerates in
   human bodies and makes the lives of an already precarious population
   unliveable. Through a review of the strategies adopted by the government
   in relation to migrants, undocumented workers and asylum seekers, this
   article shows how the gendered experiences of certain asylum seekers
   like mothers and sexual violence survivors become the political site
   where state approved carceral practices and gendered violence merge.

TI eHealth-Enhanced Peer Navigation for Substance Use Treatment and HIV
   Prevention Service Linkage for Young Adults Surveilled by the Criminal

VL 13
AR e54815

AB Background: In the United States, the proportion of criminal
   legal-involved (CLI) adults with a substance use disorder reaches 72%,
   and similar to 150,000 persons with HIV pass through a carceral setting
   annually, which represents 16% of the HIV-infected population
   nationally. Despite the high need for substance use treatment and HIV
   prevention services, few carceral settings successfully link CLI
   individuals to treatment upon release. Young adults represent 41.9% of
   the adults incarcerated in the United States and have the highest HIV
   incidence rates nationally. Peer patient navigation has successfully
   increased community-based care linkage for people living with HIV
   leaving jail; yet, peer-led navigation for HIV prevention among
   HIV-negative CLI populations is undeveloped and untested. eHealth
   approaches to substance use and HIV prevention services hold promise
   because they improve access to effective intervention services,
   particularly for younger people.
   Objective: This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomized
   controlled trial that aims to improve linkage to substance use treatment
   and HIV prevention services using peer navigation and a codeveloped
   eHealth technology adjunct.
   Methods: The three aims of this study are to (1) adapt an existing
   evidence-based navigator model and incorporate codeveloped eHealth
   technology to refer and link young adults (18 to 29 years) surveilled by
   the criminal legal system to substance use and pre-exposure prophylaxis
   (PrEP) services; (2) refine and test the intervention with criminal
   legal-involved young adults (CLI-YAs); and (3) assess the feasibility,
   acceptability, and impact of the intervention. Data to inform the
   intervention will be collected via system partner interviews (n=4) and
   focus groups with CLI-YAs (n=24). Next, an open trial (n=10) will be
   conducted. The intervention will be refined via interviews with
   participants and facilitators, and a randomized pilot trial (n=75) will
   be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
   impact of the eHealth-enhanced navigation on substance use and PrEP
   services linkage. Exit interviews conducted with a subsample of
   intervention participants (n=10), the navigator (n=1), and system
   partners (n=4) will assess intervention acceptability and suggestions
   for improvement. A community of practice, a group of system partners
   with an interest in working toward solutions to common problems, will
   inform each phase of the study.
   Results: The project is currently ongoing. The project was funded in
   September 2022. Internal review board approval was received on March 21,
   2022. The first results from early study aims are expected to be
   published in 2025.
   Conclusions: This study provides an opportunity to reduce HIV
   acquisition and improve access to substance use treatment in a
   systemically marginalized group: young CLI-YAs. The results will
   contribute to the development and testing of a future multilevel
   randomized controlled trial.

   Justice impacted individuals face many hardships including adverse
   health outcomes which can be mitigated through access to telehealth
   services and providers. During the federally recognized COVID-19
   pandemic the need for accessible healthcare was exacerbated and
   telehealth use surged. While access to telehealth should be considered a
   necessity, there are many challenges and barriers for justice impacted
   individuals to be able to utilize this service. This perspective
   examines aspects of accessibility, pandemic, policy, digital tools, and
   ethical and social considerations of telehealth in correctional
   facilities. Carceral facilities should continue to innovate and invest
   in telehealth to revolutionize healthcare delivery, and improve health
   outcomes for justice impacted individuals.

AB Introduction: Harm reduction resources for people who are involved in
   the criminal-legal system should be easily accessible. The Rhode Island
   Department of Corrections (DOC) used funding from a state opioid
   stewardship fund created through the Rhode Island Opioid Stewardship Act
   (legislation passed in 2019) to implement five custom-designed vending
   machines for community corrections offices and state awaiting trial
   carceral facilities. The vending machines provide resources for overdose
   prevention, infection prevention, basic needs, and nicotine replacement
   therapy (NRT). We aim to describe the development and rollout of the
   vending machines and present data about items taken most frequently by
   setting. Methods: Research and design experts, with DOC and community
   stakeholders, developed and tailored the public-facing design of the
   vending machines. Before implementation, the researchers from the
   development team conducted meetings with staff at each location to
   discuss harm reduction and their role in addressing the opioid crisis in
   this high-risk population. The machines were manufactured in 2022 and
   installed in early 2023 (dates varied by location). The community
   support and advocacy organization tracks and maintains inventory (items
   taken and replaced) by month. No individual-level client data is
   collected. Results: There were 3720 items dispensed from May 2022 to
   February 2024 across five locations. Overall, hygiene kits were the most
   frequently accessed item (28.3 %, n = 1051), followed by NRT (19.0 %, n
   = 706) and ponchos (16.6 %, n = 616). The fentanyl tests (n = 230),
   wound care kits (n = 248), resource guide (n = 253), naloxone (n = 221),
   and safer sex kits (n = 218) each made up between 5.9 % and 6.8 % of
   items accessed. The pregnancy test was the least accessed at 4.8 % (n =
   177). There were statistically significant differences in the monthly
   number of items distributed by location for the basic needs items,
   excluding NRT, with 39 items per month at the three Probation/Parole
   locations compared to 21 per month for the two DOC facilities.
   Conclusions: The utilization patterns demonstrate the demand for basic
   supplies and support related to harm reduction. Monitoring and
   summarizing utilization ensures that the vending machines remain useful
   to the community and facilitates transparency and communication with
   stakeholders.

AB Michel Foucault argued that a key modality of state racism is biopower,
   through which the life of populations is differentially supported,
   shaped, and neglected. However, Foucault's account of state racism is
   unfinished, because it fails to identify the modalities of power that
   persist when states withdraw life-supporting technologies from
   racialized populations, thereby committing "indirect murder." It
   develops Foucault's account of racism and the racial state by describing
   the carceral technologies that expand with the withdrawal ofbiopower. To
   do so, this article draws on Foucault's theorization of carcerality in
   Discipline and Punish. It argues that biopolitical withdrawal is doubled
   by a simultaneous carceral investment, such that the state's denial of
   life-supporting technologies occurs in tandem with the racially
   structured policing of the poor. Additionally, this article explains how
   Foucault's concept of the management of illegalisms identifies a key
   vehicle of racialization, and illuminates the utility of carceral
   systems to racial capitalism.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disproportionately affects people deprived
   of liberty. Prior studies have shown higher TB treatment completion
   rates among incarcerated individuals compared to the general population.
   However, little is known about how incarceration-related movements such
   as transfers between facilities or releases to the community affect TB
   treatment outcomes.
   Methods: We linked person-level incarceration data with TB notifications
   data from the Notifiable Disease Information System for the Brazilian
   state of Mato Grosso do Sul between January 2006 and December 2018. We
   constructed a cohort of individuals newly diagnosed with
   drug-susceptible TB who initiated treatment while incarcerated. We
   compared treatment outcomes between individuals who remained in the same
   carceral facility and those who were transferred to other facilities or
   released from incarceration during treatment. We computed the
   covariate-adjusted relative risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes for
   individuals transferred or released during treatment.
   Results: We identified 1,274 individuals who initiated TB treatment
   while incarcerated. Of these individuals, 849 (66.6%) remained in the
   same carceral facility, 259 (20.3%) were transferred to other
   facilities, and 166 (13.0%) were released to the community during
   treatment. Among those who remained in the same carceral facility, 72.3%
   (614/849) were successfully treated within eight months following
   treatment initiation. In contrast, only 61.0% (158/259) of those who
   were transferred and 49.4% (82/166) of those who were released achieved
   TB treatment success within eight months. After adjusting for
   covariates, the risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes was 1.4 (95% CI:
   1.2 to 1.7) times as high for individuals transferred to other
   facilities and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3 to 2.0) times as high for individuals
   released from incarceration, compared to those who remained incarcerated
   in the same facility during treatment. For individuals released less
   than two months into treatment, the risk of unfavorable treatment
   outcomes was twice as high (adjusted relative risk [aRR]:2.1, 95% CI:
   1.6 - 2.6).
   Conclusions: Transfers between facilities and releases from
   incarceration are common and may pose barriers to TB treatment
   completion. Strategies for ensuring continuity of care across carceral
   facilities and between prison and community health systems are urgently
   needed to improve TB outcomes for individuals impacted by incarceration.

AB This essay interrogates the carceral geography of the California Central
   Valley by examining Rachel Kushner's novel The Mars Room (2018), which
   unfolds the life and limiting circumstances of a woman serving two life
   sentences. With capitalism as the driving force and background of this
   novel, this article examines the problem of representation posed by the
   prison in American society. Does the novel allow for a sharper

AB Women in prison experience a double digital divide, due to gendered
   discrimination and carceral isolation. We focus on a recent policy
   change in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, whereby digital devices were
   provided to incarcerated people. This policy change is considered in
   light of women's trauma histories and the importance of community and
   family connection. We respond to themes presented at the United Nations'
   Sixty-Seventh Session on the Commission of the Status of Women,
   specifically achieving equality and empowerment for all women and girls
   in the digital age. Incarcerated women must be prioritized when
   addressing the gendered digital divide.

AB This article discusses the racialization of venereal disease during
   World War II at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, the installation with the
   largest number of African American troops, arguing that medical and law
   enforcement surveillance overlapped in venereal disease prevention
   efforts in ways unique to the post's location and racial demographics.
   It analyzes how military and civilian agencies attempted to limit
   venereal disease and how Black officers and enlisted men and women
   responded to and influenced these policies. The U.S. Army used
   statistics to construct venereal disease as a racially specific problem
   and developed venereal disease education efforts at the post. Gendered
   effects of venereal disease control policy included a proposal to
   quarantine civilian women within the post hospital. As the army tried to
   maintain racial, gender, and geographic boundaries, the biomedical and
   carceral technologies used to police venereal disease grew more similar.

AB Recent rises in incident tuberculosis (TB) cases in Paraguay and the
   increasing concentration of TB within prisons highlight the urgency of
   targeting strategies to interrupt transmission and prevent new
   infections. However, whether specific cities or carceral institutions
   play a disproportionate role in transmission remains unknown. We
   conducted prospective genomic surveillance, sequencing 471 Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis complex genomes, from inside and outside prisons in
   Paraguay's two largest urban areas, Asuncion and Ciudad del Este, from
   2016 to 2021. We found genomic evidence of frequent recent transmission
   within prisons and transmission linkages spanning prisons and
   surrounding populations. We identified a signal of frequent M.
   tuberculosis spread between urban areas and marked recent population
   size expansion of the three largest genomic transmission clusters.
   Together, our findings highlight the urgency of strengthening TB control
   programs to reduce transmission risk within prisons in Paraguay, where
   incidence was 70 times that outside prisons in 2021.
   To role that carceral institutions play in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   transmission remains somewhat unknown. Authors perform a prospective
   genomic surveillance study, to assess transmission dynamics in prisons
   and surrounding communities in Paraguay.

AB The reinstatement of Pell grant eligibility for incarcerated individuals
   marks a pivotal moment in the landscape of higher education in prison
   (HEP) programming in the United States. However, despite this promising
   development, financial barriers persist, hindering the growth and
   sustainability of HEP initiatives. This qualitative study delves into
   the challenges faced by faculty, staff, and administrators within
   Pennsylvania's colleges and universities as they establish and operate
   HEP programs amidst an evolving funding environment. Drawing on
   interviews with nine HEP administrators across the state, we explore
   obstacles they confront, ranging from the Pell grant funding gap to
   logistical hurdles such as access to educational materials and
   technology. Moreover, demographic disparities and security concerns
   emerge as significant factors impacting the relationship between HEP
   programs and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC). Our
   findings extend beyond financial constraints, revealing broader systemic
   barriers to equitable and accessible HEP programming. We provide
   potential policy solutions to address these multifaceted challenges and
   foster a more supportive institutional environment for post-secondary
   education in Pennsylvania's carceral system.

AB Background Establishing and maintaining relationships and ways of
   connecting and being with others is an important component of health and
   wellbeing. Harnessing the relational within caring, supportive,
   educational, or carceral settings as a systems response has been
   referred to as relational practice. Practitioners, people with lived
   experience, academics and policy makers, do not yet share a well-defined
   common understanding of relational practice. Consequently, there is
   potential for interdisciplinary and interagency miscommunication, as
   well as the risk of policy and practice being increasingly disconnected.
   Comprehensive reviews are needed to support the development of a
   coherent shared understanding of relational practice.Method This study
   uses a scoping review design providing a scope and synthesis of extant
   literature relating to relational practice focussing on organisational
   and systemic practice. The review aimed to map how relational practice
   is used, defined and understood across health, criminal justice,
   education and social work, noting any impacts and benefits reported.
   Searches were conducted on 8 bibliographic databases on 27 October 2021.
   English language articles were included that involve/discuss practice
   and/or intervention/s that prioritise interpersonal relationships in
   service provision, in both external (organisational contexts) and
   internal (how this is received by workers and service users)
   aspects.Results A total of 8010 relevant articles were identified, of
   which 158 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the
   synthesis. Most were opinion-based or theoretical argument papers (n =
   61, 38.60%), with 6 (3.80%) critical or narrative reviews. A further 27
   (17.09%) were categorised as case studies, focussing on explaining
   relational practice being used in an organisation or a specific
   intervention and its components, rather than conducting an evaluation or
   examination of the effectiveness of the service, with only 11 including
   any empirical data. Of the included empirical studies, 45 were
   qualitative, 6 were quantitative, and 9 mixed methods studies. There
   were differences in the use of terminology and definitions of relational
   practice within and across sectors.Conclusion Although there may be
   implicit knowledge of what relational practice is the research field
   lacks coherent and comprehensive models. Despite definitional
   ambiguities, a number of benefits are attributed to relational
   practices.

AB Background. Prior studies demonstrate that eliminating hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) in the United States (US) heavily depends on treating incarcerated
   persons. Knowing the scope of the carceral HCV epidemic by state will
   help guide national elimination efforts.
   Methods. Between 2019 and 2023, all state prison systems received
   surveys requesting data on hepatitis C antibody and viremic prevalence.
   We supplemented survey information with publicly available HCV data to
   corroborate responses and fill in data gaps.
   Results. Weighting HCV prevalence by state prison population size, we
   estimate that 15.2% of the US prison population is HCV seropositive and
   8.7% is viremic; 54.9% of seropositive persons have detectable RNA.
   Applying prevalence estimates to the total prison population at year-end
   2021, 91 090 persons with HCV infection resided in a state prison.
   Conclusions. With updated and more complete HCV data from all 50 states,
   HCV prevalence in state prisons is nearly 9-fold higher than the US
   general population. The heterogeneity in HCV prevalence by state prison
   system may reflect variable exposure before arrest and/or differences in
   treatment availability during incarceration. Elimination of HCV in the
   country depends on addressing the carceral epidemic, and one of the
   first steps is understanding the size of the problem.

AB Healthcare under the auspices of late-stage capitalism is a total
   institution that mortifies nurses and patients alike, demanding
   conformity, obedience, perfection. This capture, which resembles
   Deleuze's enclosure, entangles nurses in carceral systems and gives way
   to a postenclosure society, an institution without walls. These
   societies of control constitute another sort of total institution, more
   covert and insidious for their invisibility (Deleuze, 1992). While
   Delezue (1992) named physical technologies like electronic
   identification badges as key to understanding these societies of
   control, the political economy of late-stage capitalism functions as a
   total institution with no cohesive, centralized, connected material
   apparatus required. In this manuscript, we outline the ways in which the
   healthcare industrial complex demands nurse conformity and how that, in
   turn, operationalizes nurses in service to the institution. This
   foundation leads to the assertion that nursing must foster a radical
   imagination for itself, unbound by reality as it presently exists, in
   order that we might conjure more just, equitable futures for caregivers
   and care receivers alike. To tease out what a radical imagination might
   look like, we dwell in paradox: getting folks the care they need in
   capitalist healthcare systems; engaging nursing's deep history to
   inspire alternative understandings for the future of the discipline; and
   how nursing might divest from extractive institutional structures. This
   paper is a jumping-off place to interrogate the ways institutions
   telescope and where nursing fits into the arrangement.

AB Police killings of Black civilians have brought unprecedented attention
   to racial and ethnic discrimination in the criminal justice and legal
   systems. However, these topics have been underexamined in the field of
   law-psychology, both in research and forensic-clinical practice. We
   discuss how a racial justice framework can provide guidance for
   advancing psycholegal research and forensic-clinical practice related to
   race, ethnicity, culture, and their intersections. A racial justice
   framework centers the goal of increasing fair and responsive treatment
   and just outcomes for the most vulnerable populations involved with the
   criminal justice, legal, and carceral systems and ending existing
   disparities. We argue that the framework should include the use of
   transparent nonobjectivity, in which racial justice is an explicit and
   acknowledged goal of research and practice that exists alongside a
   commitment to open and rigorous science and evidence-based practice. We
   then use the racial justice framework as a backdrop for discussing the
   articles and broader themes that appear in the special issue, which
   include racial biases in policing, public views of the police and use of
   force, expanding research on racial bias in lay judgments, understanding
   disparities in sentencing and corrections, and improving forensic
   practice. Finally, we look to the future, discussing practices and
   perspectives that can facilitate a racial justice approach in
   psycholegal research and forensic-clinical practice. Our recommendations
   include engaging in reflexivity and addressing positionality; expanding
   research questions and methods, especially qualitative and
   community-based participatory action research; centering and engaging
   with communities of color; greater emphasis on intersectionality;
   shifting toward structural and adaptive interventions; and greater
   integration of work from other fields.

   mistreatment, barriers to gender-affirming care, and human rights
   violations, conferring high risk for trauma, psychological distress,
   self-harm, and suicide. Across the globe, most carceral settings are
   segregated by sex assigned at birth and governed by housing policies
   that restrict gender expression-elevating 'safety and security' above
   the housing preferences of incarcerated people.Aim/methodsDrawing upon
   the lived experiences of 24 formerly incarcerated trans women in
   Australia and the United States and employing Elizabeth Freeman's notion
   of chrononormativity, Rae Rosenberg's concept of heteronormative time,
   and Kadji Amin's use of queer temporality, this paper explores trans
   women's carceral housing preferences and contextual experiences,
   including how housing preferences challenge governing chrononormative
   and reformist carceral housing systems.FindingsParticipants freely
   discussed their perspectives regarding housing options which through
   thematic analysis generated four options for housing: 1) men's carceral
   settings; 2) women's carceral settings; 3) trans- and gay-specific
   housing blocks; and 4) being housed in protective custody or other
   settings. There appeared to be a relationship between the number of
   times the person had been incarcerated, the duration of their
   incarceration, and where they preferred to be housed.ConclusionsThis
   analysis contributes to richer understandings regarding trans women's
   experiences while incarcerated. This paper also informs the complexities
   and nuances surrounding housing preferences from the perspectives of
   trans women themselves and considers possible opportunities to enhance
   human rights, health and wellbeing when engaging in transformative
   approaches to incarceration.

AB Background & aimsThe COVID-19 pandemic created intersecting health risks
   for incarcerated people with a history of substance use disorder (SUD).
   To reduce exposure to COVID-19 in prison, several US states enacted
   decarceration legislation. New Jersey enacted the Public Health
   Emergency Credit Act (PHECA), granting early release to thousands of
   incarcerated persons meeting eligibility criteria. This study undertook
   to explore how large scale decarceration during the pandemic impacted
   the reentry process for released individuals with SUDs.MethodsTwenty
   seven participants involved in PHECA releases - 21 persons released from
   NJ carceral facilities with past/present SUDs (14 with opioid use
   disorder, 7 with other SUDs) and 6 reentry service providers acting as
   key informants - completed phone interviews on PHECA experiences from
   February-June 2021. Cross-case thematic analysis of transcripts
   identified common themes and divergent perspectives.ResultsRespondents
   described challenges consistent with long-documented reentry
   difficulties including housing and food insecurity, difficulty accessing
   community services, insufficient employment opportunities, and limited
   access to transportation. Challenges that were pertinent to mass release
   during a pandemic included limited access to communication technology
   and community providers and community providers exceeding enrollment
   capacity. Despite reentry difficulties, respondents identified many
   areas where prisons and reentry service providers adapted to meet novel
   challenges presented by mass decarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Facilitators made available by prison and reentry provider staff
   included providing released persons with cell phones, transportation
   assistance at transit hubs, prescription support for medications for
   opioid use disorder, and pre-release assistance with ID and benefits
   through NJ's Joint Comprehensive Assessment Plan.ConclusionsFormerly
   incarcerated people with SUDs experienced reentry challenges during
   PHECA releases similar to those that occur during ordinary
   circumstances. Despite barriers faced during typical releases and novel
   challenges unique to mass release during a pandemic, providers made
   adaptations to support released persons' successful reentry.
   Recommendations are made based on areas of need identified in
   interviews, including reentry service provision facilitating housing and
   food security, employment, medical services, technology fluency, and
   transportation. In anticipation of future large scale releases,
   providers will benefit from planning ahead and adapting to address
   temporary increases in resource demands.

AB Geographers have been central to identifying and exploring the shifting
   spatialities of border enforcement and how different enforcement
   strategies alter the geography of state sovereignty. Migration-related
   public information campaigns (PICs) are one strategy that has received
   increasing attention from geographers and social scientists more broadly
   in recent years. Although existing research examines the sites and
   spaces where PICs are distributed, as well as the affective content of
   their messaging, little research has examined the development of
   campaigns and the transnational connections that enable their
   deployment. This article draws on work in the fields of carceral
   circuitry and transnational enforcement networks to expand our
   understanding of affective governmentality as a transnational strategy
   of border governance. Based on data collected as part of a large-scale
   comparative study of the use of PICs by the U.S. and Australian
   governments, we argue that this form of affective governmentality relies
   on transnational circuits through which people, money, and knowledge
   move to enable the development and circulation of affective messaging.
   In doing so, we develop the concept of transnational affective circuitry
   to refer to the often contingent, temporary relations and connections
   that enable PICs to operate as a form of transnational affective
   governmentality aimed at hindering unauthorized migration. Our analysis
   illustrates the transnational connections that enable increasingly
   expansive and creative forms of border enforcement to emerge while also
   expanding the scope of examinations of affective governmentality to
   attend to the relations that undergird and enable this form of
   transnational governance.

AB This paper has a dual object: First, utilizing Foucault's definition of
   'disciplinary power', the paper demonstrates the disciplinary nature of
   China's reform through labour (laogai) system. It is suggested that
   laogai is an extension, deepening and modification of certain
   nineteenth-century Western utilitarian penal themes designed to 'reform
   the criminal mind' and produce 'obedient subjects'. Second, having
   established the disciplinary nature of die laogai project the paper then
   goes on to examine the (neo-Foucauldian) 'disciplinary dispersal
   thesis'. This thesis suggests a gradual spread of carceral technologies
   which led to the formation of a disciplinary society. This paper
   suggests that there are a number of theoretical problems in this thesis,
   not the least of which is its rather ambiguous relationship to the work
   of Foucault.

AB This article examines the role that data-driven technologies play in
   expanding and reasserting the legitimacy of the US racial state during
   times of crisis. Specifically, I examine how prison officials used a
   software called Verus to reinforce the perceived necessity of penal
   institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government officials used
   Verus to produce narratives that (1) recast criminalized communities as
   dangerous and therefore disposable and (2) shielded carceral
   institutions from liability for systematic neglect. Ultimately, the aim
   of this article is to contribute to emerging critical concepts such as
   "data colonialism," a term that has largely been used to describe the
   social and economic consequences of parasitic data extraction and
   monopoly control of digital infrastructure. In addition to these issues,
   I argue that data-driven technologies are used as vehicles for movement
   capture and the reproduction of prison logics that enable modes of
   racialized economic exploitation that extend far beyond the high-tech
   innovation economy.

AB While there are many data-driven approaches to identifying individuals
   at risk of suicide, they tend to focus on clinical risk factors, such as
   previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and rarely include risk factors
   that occur in nonclinical settings, such as jails or emergency shelters.
   A better understanding of system-level encounters by individuals at risk
   of suicide could help inform suicide prevention efforts. In
   Philadelphia, we built a community-level data infrastructure that
   encompassed suicide death records, behavioral health claims,
   incarceration episodes, emergency housing episodes, and involuntary
   commitment petitions to examine a broader spectrum of suicide risk
   factors. Here, we describe the development of the data infrastructure,
   present key trends in suicide deaths in Philadelphia, and, for the
   Medicaid-eligible population, determine whether suicide decedents were
   more likely to interact with the behavioral health, carceral, and
   housing service systems compared to Medicaid-eligible Philadelphians who
   did not die by suicide. Between 2003 and 2018, there was an increase in
   the number of annual suicide deaths among Medicaid-eligible individuals,
   in part due to changes in Medicaid eligibility. There were
   disproportionately more suicide deaths among Black and Hispanic
   individuals who were Medicaid-eligible, who were younger on average,
   compared to suicide decedents who were never Medicaid-eligible. However,
   when we accounted for the racial and ethnic composition of the Medicaid
   population at large, we found that White individuals were four times as
   likely to die by suicide, while Asian, Black, Hispanic, and individuals
   of other races were less likely to die by suicide. Overall, 58% of
   individuals who were Medicaid-eligible and died by suicide had at least
   one Medicaid-funded behavioral health claim, 10% had at least one
   emergency housing episode, 25% had at least one incarceration episode,
   and 22% had at least one involuntary commitment. By developing a data
   infrastructure that can incorporate a broader spectrum of risk factors
   for suicide, we demonstrate how communities can harness administrative
   data to inform suicide prevention efforts. Our findings point to the
   need for suicide prevention in nonclinical settings such as jails and
   emergency shelters, and demonstrate important trends in suicide deaths
   in the Medicaid population.

AB Cultural criminologists have long been interested in the politics of
   crime and deviance, whether that be in relation to youth subculture
   resistance or the social reaction to transgression evident in the media
   construction of folk devils and moral panics. While contemporary 'new'
   cultural criminology continues to be focused on the situated experience
   of deviant 'edgeworkers', this chapter argues cultural criminology's
   concern with the crime-media nexus provides particularly fertile ground
   for exploring insights provided by activists, academics, professional
   journalists and citizen journalists around informal interventions on
   formal criminal justice processes using social media and digital
   technologies. Drawing on examples from a burgeoning body of crime-media
   research, the chapter makes a case for 'cultural criminology activism',
   which, like activist criminology, is consciously disengaged from
   mainstream criminology's alignment with the neoliberal-carceral state
   and its reformist agenda.

AB Drawing on three strains of critical theory - Foucauldian biopolitics,
   critical race theory, and the work of sociologist Loic Wacquant - I
   argue that neoliberal stigma is foundational to the design of the food
   (assistance) system. Neoliberal stigma is constituted in the discursive
   practices of shame, suspicion, and surveillance, which are communicative
   and carceral technologies used to discipline poor and racialized
   communities in their efforts to manage hunger and poverty. These
   communicative technologies are rooted in anti-poor, racist, and carceral
   logics and are deployed against Black and Brown bodies negatively
   impacting health and social wellbeing. Drawing on the voices of people
   with lived experiences of hunger, I demonstrate the mundane and
   exceptional ways in which shame, suspicion, and surveillance emerge in
   discursive practices surrounding food assistance and how these practices
   enjoin food assistance and carcerality into a 'single organizational
   contraption.' The analysis ends with three broad interventions required
   to disrupt neoliberal stigma amid racist violence.

AB This paper focuses on surveillance technologies that New York City
   landlords have been installing in low-income, public, and affordable
   tenant housing over the last decade. It looks at how new forms of
   biometric and facial recognition-based landlord technology automate
   gentrification and carcerality, reproducing racist systems of
   recognition and displacement. We offer these systems a genealogy and
   geography, looking at intersections of zoning, gentrification, eviction,
   and policing that have historically solidified to dispossess and
   incarcerate tenants of color. Additionally, this paper addresses how and
   why New York City has emerged as the world's epicenter of "landlord
   tech," mapping out several decades of urban datafication that have
   rendered low-income, nonwhite majority housing complexes as laboratories
   for surveillance experimentations today. We observe how processes of
   "catching" tenants for lease violations automate a longer history of
   racist surveillance and property-making. Yet we also highlight
   tenant-led resistance that has successfully thwarted facial recognition
   deployment and that continues to organize for landlord tech abolition
   today. Through affective organizing, grounded relationality, and
   alliance-building, tenants have created vital abolitionist space and
   knowledge to curb landlord technologies and the carceral logics they
   encode.

AB In recent years, journalists and researchers have used mixed methods to
   characterize a pattern of prison landscapes being exposed to
   environmental hazards such as air pollution, proximity to hazardous
   facilities, and inadequate mitigation in extreme weather-a pattern
   frequently referred to as "prison ecology." However, no studies have
   sought to characterize the perceptions of organizers across U.S. cities
   who work at the intersection of prison and the environment, and the
   potential or limitations of data to support ongoing activities. We
   conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with organizers that work on
   issues related to prison and the environment to understand the tactics
   and challenges in prison ecology organizing, and opportunities or
   limitations of geospatial data and technology development to support
   desired outcomes. Results indicate that prison ecology organizers
   regularly engage data and mapping to support their campaigns and
   challenge the state's control over information. However, activists
   reported that some data tools are overly burdensome, insufficient, or
   difficult to master. They also report a desire for new and accessible
   data and mapping tools since there are numerous gaps in knowledge about
   prisons and environmental concerns. Finally, activists articulated
   specific changes that they would like to see in the U.S. carceral system
   as a result of mobilizing around the use of key data sources. Our
   findings advance the study of the data practices of community organizers
   by providing insight into how different mediums of data and digital
   tools are currently integrated into activism. This article also offers
   constructive reflections into how datafication, and specifically remote
   sensing (RS) technology, can further be brought to bear on prison
   ecology. This work can be useful to any scholar-activists aiming to
   develop RS for prison ecology organizing or environmental justice more
   broadly.

AB Background
   There are multiple aspects of the opioid crisis among Black people, who
   have been left out of the broader conversation. Despite evidence of
   increased opioid overdose deaths, less is known about opioid use among
   Black people. This review synthesizes research on Black people who use
   opioids; the goals are to advance knowledge, highlight research gaps,
   and inform clinical practice. Methods
   This rapid review investigating opioid use among Black people utilized
   systematic review methods and was conducted according to a predefined
   protocol with clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO ID: 177071). A
   comprehensive search strategy was used, including published and
   gray-literature sources (i.e., literature that has not been formally
   published). A narrative summary of the results is presented. Results
   A total of 76 works were selected for inclusion and full text review.
   Sex, age, geographic location, and involvement in the carceral system
   were associated with the use of opioids among Black individuals.
   Non-epidemiologic factors included treatment-seeking patterns, disparate
   clinician prescribing, and social determinants. Conclusions
   Through this rapid review we suggest three main areas of focus: (1)
   including culturally informed collection methods in epidemiologic
   surveys to accurately reflect prevalences, (2) funding research that
   specifically addresses the importance of culture in accessing treatment,
   and (3) directly studying how social determinants can improve or
   exacerbate health outcomes. Focusing on the unique needs of Black people
   who use opioids is warranted to increase treatment initiation and
   adherence among a population less likely to engage with the traditional
   health care system.

AB Disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive while the
   consequences for incarcerated persons have grown increasingly visible.
   Simultaneously, scholars, individuals, and communities are grappling
   with police brutality and systemic anti-Black racism in the criminal
   legal system by engaging with the concept of abolition. In this article
   we demonstrate that these issues are not disconnected and argue that the
   abolition of the prison industrial complex (PIC) would mitigate the
   impacts of disasters for incarcerated persons and their communities.
   Incarceration undermines individual and collective resilience needed to
   recover from disasters, whereas carceral infrastructure facilitates
   disaster harm to incarcerated persons and their communities.
   Incarceration itself mirrors the harm and destruction of a disaster.
   Abolition of the PIC would not only prevent harm from incarceration, but
   also systems of accountability put in place by communities as suggested
   by abolitionists would contribute to the resilience of individuals and
   communities. By examining these connections, we provide a framework for
   considerations of abolition in an era of reckoning with anti-Blackness,
   the violence of the criminal legal system, and climate change, and
   suggest further investment of research in these areas.

AB Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that
   technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism.
   Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality
   [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the
   carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated
   how the design of technologies for community safety can resist
   structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to
   traditional policing activities, including story-telling,
   community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of
   work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs
   their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of
   research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of
   building safer communities. This is an area of great potential-just as
   community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional
   policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of
   community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social
   structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a
   community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not
   only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and
   norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems
   so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this
   paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ,
   my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.

AB Since the implementation of the Young Offenders Act (YOA) in 1984, very
   little attention has been given to the state of the under 12'' offender.
   The following article analyzes preliminary data on offenders under 12
   years of age, gathered from 27 contributing police forces across Canada.
   In addition to presenting assumed causes or contributors to the
   anti-social and offending behaviour of those between the ages of 7 and
   11, the article critiques the province of Ontario for its lack of
   response to the current state of the young offender system. Because of
   the need for a radical reorientation of legislation and services for
   children, a comprehensive, ecological paradigm is proposed which, it is
   argued would reflect a more holistic, humane, and community-based
   approach, to the benefit of ''under twelves''.

AB Facing the current growing global archipelago of encampments including
   concentration, detention, transit, identification, refugee, military and
   training camps, this article is a geographical reflection on 'the camp',
   as a modern institution and as a spatial bio-political technology. In
   particular, it is about the past and present camp geographies and the
   apparatus of dispositifs that make them an ever-present spatial
   formation in the management of custody and care characterizing many
   authoritarian regimes as well as many contemporary democracies. I
   especially focus on the works of Paul Gilroy, Giorgio Agamben and Reviel
   Netz to discuss camp spatialities, the normalization of camp
   geographies, and related biopolitics. In doing so, I advance the
   argument to resist on present-day proliferating manifestations of camp
   and 'camp thinking', calling for the incorporation of 'camp studies'
   into the broader field of political geography to considering the
   geographies of the camp as constitutive hubs of much broader, modern
   geopolitical economies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Acoustic gunshot detection systems (AGDS) have been emerging as a
   technological solution to the growing problem of gun violence around the
   world. We examine a particularly prominent AGDS technology called
   RespondTM developed by publicly traded US company ShotSpotter Inc.
   (NASDAQ: SSTI) to better understand the sociotechnical logics that
   inform its operation. Drawing from frameworks provided by science and
   technology studies and sound studies, we ask, "What are the broader
   conditions that allow for a successful AGDS as it is imagined by
   ShotSpotter?" At a time in which the accuracy and reliability of
   ShotSpotter's AGDS are being seriously questioned through the numerous
   reports of false positives that reached as high as 99 percent in certain
   cities it was deployed in, it is imperative to interrogate what exactly
   is "false" in these false positive reports and how the company operates
   despite them. In this paper, we trace ShotSpotter and its artificial
   intelligence/machine learning AGDS technologies as they exist across
   various patents, promotional materials, financial documents, and public
   statements to not only better understand the ways in which they
   translate sound into "crime," or space into "crime scene," but also to
   bring attention to how ShotSpotter translates itself across its
   different audiences.

AB Police violence shapes the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, and
   while much has been written about strategic responses to police, missing
   is an examination of how black women navigate interactions with
   officers. Based on 32 interviews with black women, we find that they use
   witnessing, or the mobilization of others as observers to police
   encounters. Research demonstrates the rising role of videos and
   smartphones in documenting encounters with officers. We find that black
   women adapt witnessing techniques based on their surroundings, available
   resources, and network contacts. Three forms of witnessing are observed:
   physical witnessing, mobilizing others in close proximity to
   interactions with officers; virtual witnessing, using cellphone or
   social media technology to contact others or record interactions with
   officers; and institutional witnessing, leveraging police or other
   institutional contacts as interveners to interactions with officers.
   Black women mobilize witnessing to deescalate violence, gather evidence,
   and promote accountability. Attuned to both the interactional and
   structural dynamics of police encounters, black women conceptualize
   witnessing as a way to survive police encounters and navigate their
   legal estrangement within the carceral system. We theorize black women's
   witnessing as a form of resistance as they work to reconfigure short-
   and long-term power relations between themselves, their communities, and
   police.

AB This article explores Foucault's two different notions of power: one
   where the subject is constituted by power-knowledge relations and
   another that emphasizes how power is a central feature of human action.
   By drawing out these two conceptualizations of power, Foucault's work
   contributes three critical points to the formation of medicalized
   subjectivities: (1) the issue of medicalization needs to be discussed
   both in terms of both specific practices and holistically (within the
   carceral archipelago); (2) we need to think how we as human beings are
   "disciplined" and "subjectivated" through medicalization, as discourses,
   practices, and institutions are all crystallizations of power relations;
   and (3) we need to reflect on how we can "resist" this process of
   subjectification, since "power comes from below" and patients shape
   themselves through "technologies of the self." Ultimately, Foucault's
   work does not merely assist us in refining our analysis; rather, it is
   essential for conceptualizing medicalization in contemporary society.

AB Electronic monitoring is the use of technology to track individuals
   accused or convicted of a crime (or civil violation) as an "alternative
   to incarceration." Traditionally, this technology has been in the form
   of ankle monitors, but recently federal, state, and local entities
   around the U.S. are shifting to using smartphone applications for
   electronic monitoring. These applications (apps) purport to make the
   monitoring simpler and more convenient for both the community supervisor
   and the person being monitored. However, due to the multipurpose nature
   of smartphones in people's lives and the amount of sensitive information
   (e.g., sensor data) smartphones make available, this introduces new
   risks to people coerced to use these apps.
   To understand what type of privacy-related and other risks might be
   introduced to people who use these applications, we conducted a
   privacy-oriented analysis of 16 Android apps used for electronic
   monitoring. We analyzed the apps first technically, with static and
   (limited) dynamic analysis techniques. We also analyzed user reviews in
   the Google Play Store to understand the experiences of the people using
   these apps, and also the privacy policies. We found that apps contain
   numerous trackers, the permissions requested by them vary widely (with
   the most common one being location), and the reviews indicate that
   people find the apps invasive and frequently dysfunctional. We end the
   paper by encouraging mobile app marketplaces to reconsider their role in
   the future of electronic monitoring apps, and computer security and
   privacy researchers to consider their potential role in auditing
   carceral technologies. We hope that this work will lead to more
   transparency in this obfuscated ecosystem.

AB The future of treatment ?including addiction treatment ?is
   biotechnological. Depot injections, agonist/antagonist implants, deep
   brain stimulation, and hapten conjugate vaccines are hailed by
   researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers as medicine?s best hope to
   minimize illicit use, to decrease risk of overdose and painful
   withdrawal, and to prevent diversion of medicines to illicit markets.
   Marketing and use of new technologies reveal old tensions framing
   concepts of addiction and its treatment: between medical condition and
   disorder of the will, between criminal justice and health, and between
   patient choice and system control. Using the examples of depot
   naltrexone and implantable and injectable buprenorphine in the U.S.,
   this essay considers the arc of long-acting opioid treatment and
   implications for the future. These include the rise of Vivitrol courts
   and ?carceral prescription ??where criminal justice systems mandate
   medicine to lock up brain receptors much as they might lock up people
   themselves ?as well as use of buprenorphine formulations positioned as
   increasing both patient benefit and provider control. We also consider
   lessons from debates on long-acting contraceptive technologies such as
   Norplant and Depo-Provera. While multiple new long-acting formulations
   are under development, success will be determined less by
   characteristics of particular formulations and more by whether or not
   the new technologies are accompanied by a new ethics of addiction
   treatment that emphasizes therapeutic alliance, concordance over
   compliance, and a genuine commitment to allowing patients the ability to
   narrate and be believed in their descriptions of their treatment
   experiences.

AB Contrary to commonsense understandings of torture as a form of
   information-gathering, confessions elicited through the use of torture
   produce notoriously unreliable data, and most interrogation experts
   oppose it as a result. With a focus on the US carceral regime in the War
   on Terror, this article explores the social relations and structures of
   feelings that make torture and other seemingly ineffective and absurd
   carceral practices possible and desirable as technologies of security.
   While much of international relations scholarship has focused on the
   ways in which affective and material economies of Orientalism are
   central to representations of the terrorist' threat, this article
   connects the carceral violences in the racialized lawfare against
   Muslimified people and spaces to the capture and enslavement of Africans
   and the concomitant production of the figure of the Black body as the
   site of enslaveability and openness to gratuitous violence. The article
   further explores how these carceral security practices are not simply
   rooted in racial-sexual logics of Blackness, but themselves constitute
   key sites and technologies of gendered and sexualized race-making in
   this era of post-racial triumph' (HoSang and LaBennett, 2012: 5).

AB All robots are disabled. I mean this in every possible sense. The
   anthropomorphic robot is always viewed through a deficit lens-a catalog
   of its failures to ascend from the uncanny valley. The assembly line
   robot is regarded with a precarious caution and skepticism-it is only
   noticed when it fails, becomes convalescent, a disruption to capitalist
   efficiency. Our relationship to robotic agents is constantly tensored by
   our desire that they transcend human limitations and our frustration
   that they remain inelegant and demand our vigilance and maintenance.
   Everywhere the robot is, the politics of disablement follow. Nowhere is
   this more evident than within the bodies of common cyborgs-disabled
   people whose ontology is mediated through the interface of organic
   matter and technology. Through case studies in human-robot relations (in
   the home, at work, and within the body), this piece explores how
   disability stigma informs our sociality with robotic agents and sustains
   exploitative social systems. I then deploy an alternative reading of
   these relations, informed by disabled cyborg scholarship and
   experiences, to propose cripped human-robot relations that prefigure
   liberation from the legacies of colonial, plantation, and carceral
   social relations.

AB New technologies for recording, reproducing, and disseminating sound are
   increasingly accessible and provide important opportunities for
   listening to accounts of confinement. Through a politics and practice of
   'earwitnessing detention', this article explores experiential patterns
   and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By
   'tuning in' to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral
   spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal
   prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of 'indefinite stuckness'.
   Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral
   continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by
   massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite
   stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for
   Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and
   re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how
   detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity
   for respite from the 'chaos' outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent
   accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms
   of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies
   indefinite stuckness.

AB The future of treatment -including addiction treatment -is
   biotechnological. Depot injections, agonist/antagonist implants, deep
   brain stimulation, and hapten conjugate vaccines are hailed by
   researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers as medicine's best hope to
   minimize illicit use, to decrease risk of overdose and painful
   withdrawal, and to prevent diversion of medicines to illicit markets.
   Marketing and use of new technologies reveal old tensions framing
   concepts of addiction and its treatment: between medical condition and
   disorder of the will, between criminal justice and health, and between
   patient choice and system control. Using the examples of depot
   naltrexone and implantable and injectable buprenorphine in the U.S.,
   this essay considers the arc of long-acting opioid treatment and
   implications for the future. These include the rise of Vivitrol courts
   and "carceral prescription "-where criminal justice systems mandate
   medicine to lock up brain receptors much as they might lock up people
   themselves -as well as use of buprenorphine formulations positioned as
   increasing both patient benefit and provider control. We also consider
   lessons from debates on long-acting contraceptive technologies such as
   Norplant and Depo-Provera. While multiple new long-acting formulations
   are under development, success will be determined less by
   characteristics of particular formulations and more by whether or not
   the new technologies are accompanied by a new ethics of addiction
   treatment that emphasizes therapeutic alliance, concordance over
   compliance, and a genuine commitment to allowing patients the ability to
   narrate and be believed in their descriptions of their treatment
   experiences.

AB Trinidadian thinker and activist C. L. R. James penned a criticism of
   Herman Melville's work, Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways, while
   incarcerated in Ellis Island, New York, in the early 1950s. I
   investigate how the contradictory claims on labour and race, literary
   analysis, and communism in the last chapter come from what I call the
   prison-detention continuum: a historical continuity allocated to prison
   and detention facilities despite an overt difference between the two.
   The distinction survived so as to maintain racial classification and
   labour force from the times of slavery and plantation to the Cold War
   era. The physical statuses of those incarcerated were insecure when the
   McCarran-Walter Act legalized ideological surveillance and accelerated
   racism inside and outside the carceral spaces. In his book on Melville,
   James clarifies the difference between prison and detention by
   emphasizing labour's role in Ellis Island. He situates his personal
   experience of maltreatment of his ulcer as a structural issue, produced
   by the way the officers obey their authorities without any principle. To
   foreground the docile individuals in the totalitarian society, he
   compares the inmates and officers on Ellis Island with the shipmates of
   the Pequod in Moby Dick. Furthermore, he regards that if labour is
   racialized, it will necessarily culminate in revolt. I argue that
   James's reference to the Korean War POWs on Koje Island prefigures an
   interracial solidarity that becomes visible after the Bandung Conference
   of 1955.

   Louisiana's Angola Prison in the 1950s to show that moving images
   coexisted with the brutalities for which the prison is known, including
   stark labor conditions, corporal violence, and punitive racism. Despite
   their promotion as improvements during an era of reform, the
   technologies of film and television accommodated the prison's repressive
   hierarchies of race, gender, and labor. By analyzing the penitentiary's
   newspaper, the Angolite, alongside its peer publications at other
   prisons, I show that prison newspapers played a significant role in
   promoting film exhibition in carceral spaces.

AB Using the ethical and legal concept of shared responsibility for healthy
   births, this article considers social, cultural, and historical contexts
   in which medicalization and criminalization have worked in tandem to
   widen surveillance in ways that intensify scrutiny of women's lives
   under the guise of child protection, bringing women who are pregnant,
   postpartum, or parenting under criminal justice control. Although
   pregnant and postpartum women are prime candidates for
   medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the expanding carceral system has
   not prioritized drug treatment or reproductive justice. This article
   investigates ethical and historical dimensions of the question,
   According to which principles and practices should screening and
   surveillance be carried out to reduce harm, safeguard civil and human
   rights-including reproductive autonomy-and ensure that treatment, when
   necessary, occurs in the least coercive settings possible?

AB TOPIC/PROBLEM: Since 1978, the federal inmates of Canada serving time
   have had access to a full range of psychiatric care within the carceral
   system. Five psychiatric units are part of the Federal Correctional
   Services. Nursing practice in forensic psychiatry opens up new horizons
   in nursing. This complex professional nursing practice involves the
   coupling of two contradictory socio-professional mandates: to punish and
   to provide care.
   METHOD: The purpose of this article is to present the results of a
   grounded theory doctoral study realized in a multi-level security
   psychiatric ward of the Canadian Federal Penitentiary System. The
   theoretical work of the late French philosopher, Michel Foucault, and
   those of sociologist, Erving Goffman, are used to illuminate the
   qualitative data that emerged from the author's fieldwork.
   FINDINGS: A Foucauldian perspective allows us to understand the way
   forensic psychiatric nursing is involved in the governance of mentally
   ill criminals through a vast array of power techniques (sovereign,
   disciplinary, and pastoral) which posited nurses as "subjects of power".
   These nurses are also "objects of power" in that nursing practice is
   constrained by formal and informal regulations of the penitentiary
   context.
   CONCLUSION: As an object of "governmental technologies", the nursing
   staff becomes the body onto which a process of conforming to the customs
   of the correctional milieu is dictated and inscribed. The results of
   this qualitative research, from a nursing perspective, are the first of
   their kind to be reported in Canada since the creation of the Regional
   Psychiatric Correctional Units in 1978.

   organizational field of asylums, prisons, orphanages, and other carceral
   organizations operating in New York City in 1888. Foucault argues that
   institutional power is organized into dually ordered system of truth and
   power. Using text data describing the clients and institutional
   technologies (organizational "power signatures") of 168 organizations,
   we apply structural equivalence methods to unpack speech activity,
   showing that as Foucault suggests, there may be dually ordered
   sub-domains of truth and power that help de. ne the underlying logic of

AB This paper seeks to examine how the imagination of the future of urban
   space as a result of technological development develops through SF
   fiction, and Hao Jingfang’s novel “Folding Beijing” as the target text.
   In the SF genre, urban space is one of the most important factors. The
   city is portrayed as the best embodied space for the cutting edge of
   science and technology covered by the SF genre and the new living
   conditions that humans face to face to face. Therefore, SF fiction
   presents a variety of imaginations in various ways about how the digital
   transformation of urban space we face today will unfold. This paper,
   among others, looks at what type of urban space Beijing’s dystopian
   future presents, described by Hao Jingfang’s novel “The Folding Beijing”
   which won the Hugo Prize in 2016.Beijing, the “Folding Beijing” drawn by
   Hao Jingfang, is divided into first, second and third spaces, each
   inhabited by upper, middle and lower classes, and these spaces do not
   coexist at the same time. When one space is spread out on the surface at
   a specified time, the rest of the space folds and disappears on the
   other side of the surface.This paper attempts to analyze the properties
   of Beijing as described in the “Folding Beijing” using the theories of
   urban scholars. And identify the folding city depicted in the work as a
   reflection of the various urban problems that Beijing now faces. Take a
   look at the dystopian prospects that will emerge when the various urban
   problems facing the current metropolises are combined with digital
   transitions that lean on the development of science and technology.
AK 본 논문은 기술발달에 따른 도시공간의 미래에 대한 상상력이 SF 소설을 통해 어떻게 전개되는지 고찰하기 위해 2016년 휴고상을
   수상한 郝景芳의 SF 소설 〈접는 도시〉가 묘사하는 베이징의 디스토피아적 미래를 중심으로 살펴본다. 그를 위해 본 논문은
   도시학자들의 이론들을 빌어 〈접는 도시〉에서 묘사된 베이징의 속성에 대한 분석을 시도한다. 그리고 작품에묘사된 접는 도시가 실은
   현재 베이징이 직면하고 있는 여러 가지 도시문제를 반영해낸 것임을 규명한다. 현재의 대도시들이 직면하고 있는 각종 도시문제들이
   과학기술의 발전에 기댄디지털 전환과 결합되었을 때 드러나게 될 디스토피아적 전망을 살펴본다.

AB This essay takes issues with the panoptical condition of representation
   in 19th century European novels and paintings. By the panoptical
   condition, I am referring to the way in which images of solitude
   (solitary confinement, self-absorption, etc.) tend to organize a modern,
   ideologically constraining notion of selfhood, and in doing so, also
   implicate Jeremy Bentham’s theory of carceral technologies and moral
   discipline. My task in the essay is to challenge this type of
   representation by relating how it is often accompanied by a series of
   inconsistencies or conflicts in trying to tell a coherent story of
   solitude. I want to argue that such a difficulty signals a protean,
   slippery region of human perception that tends to refer to movements and
   nuances in human experience, which are too subtle or elusive to be
   detected by the panoptical frame of representation.Another purpose of
   the essay is to relate the meaning of these features in the urban
   context. For this urban outlook, I will historicize how the panoptical
   representation emerged in response to an increasing anxiety among the
   informed public about the modern city as the hotbed of moral levity. The
   idea of prison reform in the nineteenth century as the tool of moral
   rehabilitation was offered as an effective antidote to the city’s
   “relaxed morality”. In keeping with my anti-disciplinary approach, the
   essay aims to explore the problem of such a penal outlook by drawing on
   the city as the site of manifold, often unpredictable experiences that
   both complicates as well as facilitates the idea of prison reform.With
   such a view in mind, I will examine a selection of novels by Balzac and
   Dickens and paintings by William Frith, in which the figuration of
   solitary confinement merges with types of multiplicitynoises,
   pedestrians, crowds, vehicles, etc.that are brought on by the city. The
   intercrossing between isolation and communication produces unique moves
   such as perspectival shifts and figural variations, which are
   inconsistent with what the panoptical frame of representation purports
   to illustrate. In challenging boundaries and rules of panoptical
   discipline, these features draw on the urban multiplicity as the common
   thread of different interventions.

AB Heat is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
   People who are incarcerated are especially vulnerable to heat exposure
   due to demographic characteristics and their conditions of confinement.
   Evaluating heat exposure in prisons, and the characteristics of exposed
   populations and prisons, can elucidate prison-level risk to heat
   exposure. We leveraged a high-resolution air temperature data set to
   evaluate short and long-term patterns of heat metrics for 1,614 prisons
   in the United States from 1990 to 2023. We found that the most
   heat-exposed facilities and states were mostly in the Southwestern
   United States, while the prisons with the highest temperature anomalies
   from the historical record were in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast,
   Texas, and parts of the Midwest. Prisons in the Pacific Northwest, the
   Northeast, and upper Midwest had the highest occurrences of days
   associated with an increased risk of heat-related mortality. We also
   estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and
   individual-level characteristics. We found higher proportions of
   non-white and Hispanic populations in the prisons with higher heat
   exposure. Lastly, we found that heat exposure was higher in prisons with
   any of nine facility-level characteristics that may modify risk to heat.
   This study brings together distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability,
   and risk, which would each inform unique strategies for
   heat-interventions. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully
   consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of
   directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will
   have implications for who is included in fights for environmental
   justice.
   Heat is a direct and increasing threat to human health. People in prison
   are especially vulnerable to heat as an increasingly older and disabled
   population with limited agency over their conditions of confinement,
   healthcare, or access to resources to decrease heat exposure. We use an
   air temperature data set to measure short and long-term patterns of
   various heat metrics for 1,614 prisons in the United States from 1990 to
   2023. We find that the patterns of highs and lows greatly differ based
   on the metric of choice. We also estimated differences in heat exposure
   at prisons by facility and individual-level characteristics. We found
   higher proportions of non-white and Hispanic populations in prisons with
   higher heat exposure. We also found higher temperatures are in prisons
   that have characteristics that can modify exposure or vulnerability to
   increase overall risk. Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and
   risk can each inform unique strategies for heat-interventions in United
   States prisons. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully
   consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of
   directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will
   have implications for which populations and prisons are included in
   efforts to reduce heat risk.
   Prisons, incarcerated populations, and staff are exposed to heat and
   changing climates as measured through a variety of metrics Higher
   temperatures are found in prison landscapes that have characteristics
   that can modify exposure or vulnerability, increasing overall risk
   Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, can each inform
   unique strategies for heat-interventions in US prisons

AB The concept of carbon lock-in has been applied to the infrastructure,
   institutions, and discourses that lock society into carbon technologies,
   and simultaneously lock out lower-carbon alternatives. However, climate
   transitions have implications that extend beyond carbon and related
   environmental considerations. Systems of social inequality are also
   inextricably linked to and impacted by climate change governance and
   related actions. This article develops a framework to analyze inequality
   lock-in and disruption as part of climate transitions in particular
   sectors or industries. We conceptualize four distinct forms of climate
   transitions in relation to inequality: decarbonization lock-in,
   adaptation lock-in, decarbonization disruption, and adaptation
   disruption. Moreover, the framework conceptualizes the material
   mechanisms through which inequality is locked-in, or alternatively,
   disrupted by climate actions. Applying this framework to analyze the
   case of incarceration in the United States suggests that decarbonization
   and climate adaptation policies and practices are currently weighted
   toward further locking-in inequality in carceral systems.

AB In this paper, we examine immigration detention in Portugal, a system
   whose daily operations and inherent violence are overlooked in both
   public and academic discourses. Even within community psychology,
   discussions on immigration detention have largely remained on the
   fringes of scholarly debates. Guided by a justice-centered ecological
   lens, we map the contours of daily life in detention by centering the
   intersectional struggles of detained cisgender and transgender women.
   These struggles illuminate the politics of power and resistance at play
   in these sites, contributing to interrelated ecologies of knowledge and
   advancing a critical understanding of the systems of power and
   oppression articulated around borders, citizenship, and the "making of
   migration." Our findings reveal Portuguese detention centers as uncaring
   environments where women feel constantly threatened, unsafe and
   disregarded, with their well-being severely compromised. Ignorance
   reigns in these sites, wielded as a form of power. Yet, despite this,
   detained women create counterspaces and cultivate ecologies of knowledge
   and resistance from the ground up. We conclude by reflecting on how
   community-engaged scholars and activists can contribute to
   transformative and liberatory efforts against carceral border systems,
   working toward futures of freedom, dignity, and justice for all.

   article examines the United Kingdom immigration detention system through
   an abolition feminist lens. Drawing on research conducted inside and
   outside detention sites, experiential knowledge from lived experience
   and solidarity work, and secondary sources, we highlight the entangled
   and mutually constitutive relationships between intimate/interpersonal
   and institutional/state violence. Inspired by Monica Cosby's Intimate
   Partner Violence and State Violence Power and Control Wheel, our
   analysis reveals how immigration detention constitutes a form of
   racist-gendered state-corporate violence. Importantly, those who travel
   under the sign women understand this violence as directly linked to the
   gendered abuses they experienced outside detention. This underscores the
   inseparability of post-national struggles against carceral border
   regimes from feminist transformative efforts to eradicate gendered
   violence.

AB Purpose of ReviewBehaviors and practices associated with substance use
   contribute to lack of HIV virologic suppression and onward transmission.
   In the USA, many recent HIV outbreaks have been connected with substance
   use. Evidence-based strategies for integrating care of those at risk for
   and living with HIV and who use substances continue to evolve. This
   review, based on scientific and medical literature through March 2023,
   provides an overview and evaluation of initiatives for integrated care
   aimed to serve patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use
   disorder.Recent FindingsIntegrated care services can improve health
   outcomes for patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use
   disorder; for instance, treatment for an opioid use disorder can help
   improve HIV viral suppression. Brick-and-mortar facilities can provide
   successful care integration with appropriate clinic leadership to
   support multidisciplinary care teams, up-to-date provider training, and
   sufficient pharmacy stock for substance use treatment. Delivering
   healthcare services to communities (e.g., mobile healthcare clinics and
   pharmacies, telehealth) may prove to be an effective way to provide
   integrated services for those with or at risk of HIV and substance use
   disorders. Incorporating technology (e.g., mobile phone applications)
   may facilitate integrated care. Other venues, including harm reduction
   programs and carceral settings, should be targets for integrated
   services.SummaryVenues providing healthcare should invest in integrated
   care and support legislation that increases access to services related
   to HIV and substance use.

AB Background: Trans people are incarcerated at disproportionately high
   rates relative to cisgender people and are at increased risk of negative
   experiences while incarcerated, including poor mental health, violence,
   sexual abuse, dismissal of self-identity, including poor access to
   healthcare.Aims: This scoping review sought to identify what is known
   about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of correctional staff
   toward incarcerated trans people within the adult and juvenile justice
   systems.Method: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the
   five-stage iterative process developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005),
   utilizing the PRISMA guidelines and checklist for scoping reviews and
   included an appraisal of included papers. A range of databases and grey
   literature was included. Literature was assessed against predetermined
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, with included studies written in
   English, online full text availability, and reported data relevant to
   the research question.Results: Seven studies were included with four
   using qualitative methodologies, one quantitative, and two studies
   employing a mixed methods approach. These studies provided insights into
   the systemic lack of knowledge and experience of correctional staff
   working with trans people, including staff reporting trans issues are
   not a carceral concern, and carceral settings not offering
   trans-affirming training to their staff. Within a reform-based approach
   these findings could be interpreted as passive ignorance and oversights
   stressing the importance of organizational policies and leadership
   needing to set standards for promoting the health and wellbeing of
   incarcerated trans persons.Conclusions: From a transformational lens,
   findings from this study highlight the urgent need to address the
   underlying structural, systemic, and organizational factors that impact
   upon the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors staff have and hold in
   correctional, and other health and community settings to meaningfully
   and sustainably improve health, wellbeing, and gender-affirming
   treatment and care for trans communities, including make possible
   alternative methods of accountability for those who do harms.

AB U.S. prisons were especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection and
   death; however, data limitations have precluded a national accounting of
   prison mortality (including but not limited to COVID-19 mortality)
   during the pandemic. Our analysis of mortality data collected from
   public records requests (supplemented with publicly available data) from
   48 Departments of Corrections provides the most comprehensive
   understanding to date of in-custody mortality during 2020. We find that
   total mortality increased by 77% in 2020 relative to 2019, corresponding
   to 3.4 times the mortality increase in the general population, and that
   mortality in prisons increased across all age groups (49 and under, 50
   to 64, and 65 and older). COVID-19 was the primary driver for increases
   in mortality due to natural causes; some states also experienced
   substantial increases due to unnatural causes. These findings provide
   critical information about the pandemic's toll on some of the country's
   most vulnerable individuals while underscoring the need for data
   transparency and standardized reporting in carceral settings.

AB A shift in crime analysis software used by municipal police departments
   in the US is currently underway from simpler predictive models to
   criminal 'risk' forecasting that uses data not specific to crime to
   direct police to areas with 'environmental risk factors' such as bars,
   transit stops and mental health facilities. Through analyses of
   interviews with developers, industry professionals and law enforcement
   as well as published statements, this article offers a detailed
   examination of how the function and premises of 'data-driven' policing
   are altered by this turn to epistemologies of risk. I argue that the
   latent presence of 'disorder' supplements visible aberrations of
   'order.' Statistical indeterminacies are called upon to justify a range
   of police interventions, and a focus on arenas of contagion supplements
   the spatial logic of containment. These turns reveal that the paradigm
   of 'risk' participates in the cooptation by technocratic reform of
   critiques exposing the problematic geographies of policing. I therefore
   suggest a shift away from critique oriented by revealing spatial bias in
   purported objectivity and towards interventions in the
   operationalization of indeterminacy itself and the vision of public life
   that undergirds and is enacted by this software.

AB Hunger strikes appear to occupy a liminal position within the literature
   of power and resistance, constituting a contradictory means of
   empowerment - weakening the body while politically strengthening the
   subject. As such, this tactic eludes classification, in fact operating
   as an impure form of contestation. Scholars have also revealed that food
   refusal operates as a primarily symbolic form of resistance. I extend
   these conclusions to understand how hunger strikers use impure and
   contradictory discourse to frame their food refusal, a tactic understood
   best through Chela Sandoval's (2003) the notion of differential
   consciousness. Just as hunger strikes constitute an impure means of
   resistance, they also appear to prefigure opportunities for dynamic and
   impure modes of discursive contestation. Through analysis of social
   media communications, detainee letters, and press releases, I unpack
   efforts to engage and challenge the dynamic, overlapping, and seemingly
   contradictory hegemonic discourses of deservingness, rights, and family.
   I also elucidate how differential consciousness allows incarcerated
   hunger strikers and their supporters to build legitimate authority
   within recognizable relations while building space for alternative
   logics - drawing on hegemonic discourses to construct alternative
   possibilities. Hunger strikes offer unique insight into how the study of
   carceral foodways is not only about consuming food, but also about
   refusing it.

AB Confinement, hindrance, and time bring anxiety, fear, and stress, often
   accompanied by confusion and desperation. In the case of undocumented
   immigrants in the Sonoran Desert, such conditions are manipulated by way
   of surveillance and policing. These conditions, in combination with
   physical exertion, augment a physiological stress response that
   coalesces with existing traumas and fear. We undertake a critical
   mapping of relations among enforcement infrastructure, migration routes,
   and measurable features of the physical landscape to demonstrate that a
   corridor in the region functions as a labyrinth, an outcome of a
   combination of threats and stressors determined by the spaces migrants
   find themselves in after crossing the U.S./Mexico border. We argue a
   biopolitical understanding of current border policies indicates it
   reduces migrants to bare life rather than using threat, stressors, or
   trauma as instruments for manipulating behavior. We discuss how this
   labyrinth works in combination with other mechanisms, including
   criminalization, detention, abuse, separation, and deportation, to
   deliver consequences that may deter migration. Despite these efforts,
   migration routes remain plastic, indicating the continued potential to
   resist and evade the surveillance technologies and enforcement deployed
   in the borderlands. We assert that an inevitable result of the desert
   labyrinth is human mortality.

AB Disabled girls of color have unique intersectional schooling
   experiences. Yet, disabled girls of color are underrepresented in
   educational research, and often unheard. Grounded in Disability Critical
   Race Theory and sociocultural learning theory, this study expands
   current understandings of how academic and social opportunities are
   afforded or constrained in schools for disabled girls of color from
   their perspectives. Through their narratives, photographs, and maps,
   disabled girls of color in middle and high school described how social
   and spatial practices interacted with texts and technologies and in
   doing so, positively and negatively impacted their literacy
   opportunities at school. This study adds to the current literature with
   an intentional focus on the gifts, strengths, and solutions of disabled
   girls of color. Implications for future research (e.g. conducting
   student-led photovoice research with disabled girls of color) and
   generative teacher practices (e.g. using photovoice to learn about
   student experiences and make pedagogical changes) are discussed.

AB This Note challenges the increasingly normalized characterization of
   ankle monitors as a positive alternative to detention. Although ankle
   monitors have been subject to some public criticism, advocates on both
   sides of the aisle have increasingly pointed to ankle monitors as a more
   humane, cost-effective alternative to detention. In comparison to
   immigration detention or refoulement, ankle monitors are clearly the
   lesser evil. Yet this Note argues that the disadvantages of ankle
   monitors cannot be so easily dismissed. By disentangling the
   circumstances in which ankle monitors are used, this Note documents the
   harms that follow these devices across contexts. The Note then argues
   that meaningful alternatives to detention should not include ankle
   monitoring. The Note concludes by exploring both legal avenues to resist
   ankle monitoring and alternatives to detention that do not include ankle
   monitoring at all.

AB After 30 years of relentless expansion, the United States' prison system
   faces the prospect of considerable contraction. This was certainly not
   expected and continues to be refuted by policy makers, activists, and
   academic theorists alike. Using evidence drawn from New York State, this
   essay argues that decarceration is taking place and may be expected to
   continue. Preliminary findings indicate, however, that the outcome is
   not likely to be the most commonly speculated ones: a return to a
   rehabilitative model, liberal reform along the lines of justice
   reinvestment, or the straightforward replacement of mass incarceration
   with parole and probation. Evidence to date suggests that a new and
   harsher criminal justice regime marked by justice disinvestment is being
   forged, entailing a significant shift from state penal institutions to
   differentiated, community-based social control, new private and
   non-profit actors, and new data and hardware technologies. These
   observations suggest a substantial rethinking of the political economy
   and theories of mass incarceration and the carceral' or centaur' state.

TI Safer tattooing interventions in prisons: a systematic review and call

DT Review

PY 2018
AB Background: Worldwide more than ten million people are detained at any
   given time. Between 5 and 60% of people experiencing incarceration
   report receipt of a tattoo in prison - mostly clandestine, which is
   associated with risks of blood-borne infections (BBIs). Although safer
   tattooing techniques are effective in preventing BBI transmission and
   available to the general population, there is limited knowledge about
   the impact of safer tattooing strategies in prisons in terms of health
   outcomes, changes in knowledge and behaviors, and best practice models
   for implementation. The objective of this research was to identify and
   review safer tattooing interventions.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Studies of
   all design types were included if they were published until 27 June
   2018, the population was incarcerated adults, they reported quantitative
   outcomes, and were published in English, French, or Spanish.
   Results: Of 55 papers retrieved from the initial search, no
   peer-reviewed article was identified. One paper from the grey literature
   described a multi-site pilot project in Canada. Its evaluation suggested
   that the project was effective in enhancing knowledge of incarcerated
   people and prison staff on standard precautions, had the potential to
   reduce harm, provided vocational opportunities, and was feasible
   although enhancements were needed to improve implementation issues and
   efficiency.
   Conclusions: Although access to preventive services, including to safer
   tattooing interventions, is a human right and recommended by United
   Nations agencies as part of a comprehensive package of harm reduction
   interventions in prisons, this review identified only a few promising
   strategies for safer tattooing interventions in carceral settings. We
   call upon governments, criminal justice authorities, non-governmental
   organizations, and academic institutions to implement safer tattooing
   projects that adhere to the following guiding principles: i) integration
   of methodologically-rigorous implementation research; ii) involvement of
   key stakeholders (incarcerated people, prison authorities, research
   partners) in the project design, implementation, and research; iii)
   integration into a comprehensive package of BBI prevention, treatment,
   and care, using a stepwise approach that considers local resources and
   acceptability; and iv) publication and dissemination of findings, and
   scaling up efforts.

TI Technology Enhanced Substance Use and HIV Service Navigation for Sexual

DT Awarded Grant
PD Sep 01 2022
PY 2023
AB Project Summary/AbstractThere is a strong scientific premise for the
   study of integrated substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV-prevention
   interventions for individuals surveilled by the carceral system (CS).
   SUDs lead to increased rates ofCS involvement as well as increased risk
   for HIV-acquisition. Estimates of the proportion of the
   CS-involvedpopulation with a SUD reach 72%, and ~150,000 persons with
   HIV pass through a detention facility annually.Individuals with a
   self-reported sexual or gender minority (SGM) identity are
   overrepresented in the CS, andexperience well established HIV and
   substance use inequities. Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is
   aproven effective intervention for HIV-prevention, its maximal impact
   depends on uptake, and adherence amongthose at high risk. To date, few
   published studies have examined substance use treatment and
   HIV-preventionuptake among CS-involved populations, including among SGM
   adults. Peer-led navigation interventions havedemonstrated efficacy in
   building trust and reducing barriers to healthcare engagement, and hold
   strong potentialto address multiple, and complex barriers to treatment
   and HIV-prevention linkage for SGMYA surveilled by theCS. eHealth
   approaches to SUD and HIV prevention also hold promise because they
   improve access to effectiveintervention services, particularly for SGM
   groups and younger people. As a multidisciplinary team with expertisein
   behavioral health (substance use, mental health, HIV prevention), SGM
   and CS involved adults, and eHealthenhanced and navigator-led behavioral
   health interventions, we propose to address notable gaps in the
   literatureby expanding the aims of our parent award to examine the
   feasibility and acceptability of an eHealth enhancednavigator-led SUD
   and HIV-prevention referral and linkage intervention for SGMYA
   surveilled by the CS. Studyaims are to: 1) Tailor the content and
   structure of an eHealth technology-supported navigation intervention
   forsubstance use treatment and HIV-prevention (PrEP) services to the
   unique needs of SGMYA (18 to 29 years)surveilled by the CS; 2) Refine
   and test the tailored eHealth enhanced, navigator-led substance use
   treatmentand HIV prevention (PrEP) intervention for SGMYA surveilled by
   the CS, for appropriateness, satisfaction, andfidelity. This
   administrative supplement appropriately expands the scope of the parent
   award and will directlyinform a future R01 clinical trial study to test
   the efficacy of the eHealth enhanced navigation intervention
   forimproving uptake of substance use treatment and HIV prevention
   services for SGMYA impacted by the CS.

TI "Fear-suffused environments" or potential to rehabilitate? Prison
   architecture, design and technology and the lived experience of carceral
   spaces
DT Awarded Grant
PD Jan 01 2016
PY 2016
AB This research investigates developments in the design of prisons,
   exploring the propositions that punishment is manifested
   architecturally, that 'good' prison design need not cost any more than
   'bad' design, that architecture, design and technology (ADT) may impact
   on prisoners' emotional and psychological reactions to incarceration,
   including their behaviour, their willingness to engage with regimes and
   their capacity to build positive relations with other prisoners and
   staff, and that ADT may significantly influence prisoners' prospects of
   rehabilitation and reintegration into society on release. One 'lifer'
   notes that many of the crises facing penal systems in the developed
   world (including overcrowding, violence, mental and physical illness,
   drug use, high levels of suicide, self-harm etc.) are intrinsically
   related to the 'fear-suffused environments' created by prison architects
   (Hassine, 2008: 8). This research critically interrogates this
   statement.  Against that backdrop, a few new penal experiments in parts
   of northern and western Europe might be welcomed as 'humane'
   alternatives to the traditional architecture of incarceration. Equipped
   with state-of-the-art lighting imitating natural daylight, extensive use
   of glass, no bars on windows, different colour palettes creating varied
   atmospheres in each 'zone', displays of artwork, curved lines, rounded
   walls and uneven horizons, the design features being incorporated into
   some new prisons might be assumed to mitigate against the harms caused
   by imprisonment. But can aesthetic considerations make a difference to
   behaviour? If, as 19th century prison commissioners and designers
   believed, architecture can be used as a means of inflicting punishment,
   is it equally true that architecture can deliver rehabilitation? Should
   the briefs issued to those who design and plan new prisons include a
   requirement to build into their construction features that normalize
   carceral space and have potential to ease offenders' reintegration back
   into society? Or is it simply that 'a prison is a prison', regardless of
   the enlightened humanism that may underpin its design? Could it even be
   that these prisons have unintended outcomes and perverse consequences,
   or represent an extension of power and control orientated towards docile
   compliance and bring their own distinctive pains of imprisonment?
   Moreover, if the general public are as punitive in their attitudes to
   offenders, as is commonly thought, how do communities feel when prisons
   are built in their midst? How do architects of prisons balance the
   requirements that prisons should pass the 'public acceptability' test
   (which may include an expectation that they should 'look' and 'feel'
   like places of punishment) with the 'NIMBYism' which frequently greets
   the announcement of a new prison?   This project will empirically
   investigate these issues and inform future debates about how prisons
   might be designed differently in order to fulfill the goal of
   rehabilitation as well as those of security, deterrence, retribution and
   punishment. Challenging conventional wisdom and taken-for-granted
   assumptions concerning the purposes and 'effectiveness' of prisons, the
   proposed project is innovative, significant and timely. No research
   currently exists on the impact and effects - on prison staff as well as
   on inmates - of penal architecture, spatial design and the
   implementation of advanced monitoring, surveillance and communication
   technologies. The study's intent is to move beyond the traditional,
   historical focus on penal architecture e.g. the legacy of Bentham's
   Panopticon and the 19th century 'separate' and 'silent' systems (in
   which the goals of discipline and reform were built in to the fabric of
   the carceral environment), and to inform knowledge and debates from a
   contemporary and future-oriented perspective. In doing this, the
   proposed project promises to deliver significant advances on previous
   research and extant knowledge.

TI "Fear-suffused environments" or potential to rehabilitate? Prison
   architecture, design and technology and the lived experience of carceral
   spaces
DT Awarded Grant
PD Jan 01 2014
PY 2014
AB This research investigates developments in the design of prisons,
   exploring the propositions that punishment is manifested
   architecturally, that 'good' prison design need not cost any more than
   'bad' design, that architecture, design and technology (ADT) may impact
   on prisoners' emotional and psychological reactions to incarceration,
   including their behaviour, their willingness to engage with regimes and
   their capacity to build positive relations with other prisoners and
   staff, and that ADT may significantly influence prisoners' prospects of
   rehabilitation and reintegration into society on release. One 'lifer'
   notes that many of the crises facing penal systems in the developed
   world (including overcrowding, violence, mental and physical illness,
   drug use, high levels of suicide, self-harm etc.) are intrinsically
   related to the 'fear-suffused environments' created by prison architects
   (Hassine, 2008: 8). This research critically interrogates this
   statement.  Against that backdrop, a few new penal experiments in parts
   of northern and western Europe might be welcomed as 'humane'
   alternatives to the traditional architecture of incarceration. Equipped
   with state-of-the-art lighting imitating natural daylight, extensive use
   of glass, no bars on windows, different colour palettes creating varied
   atmospheres in each 'zone', displays of artwork, curved lines, rounded
   walls and uneven horizons, the design features being incorporated into
   some new prisons might be assumed to mitigate against the harms caused
   by imprisonment. But can aesthetic considerations make a difference to
   behaviour? If, as 19th century prison commissioners and designers
   believed, architecture can be used as a means of inflicting punishment,
   is it equally true that architecture can deliver rehabilitation? Should
   the briefs issued to those who design and plan new prisons include a
   requirement to build into their construction features that normalize
   carceral space and have potential to ease offenders' reintegration back
   into society? Or is it simply that 'a prison is a prison', regardless of
   the enlightened humanism that may underpin its design? Could it even be
   that these prisons have unintended outcomes and perverse consequences,
   or represent an extension of power and control orientated towards docile
   compliance and bring their own distinctive pains of imprisonment?
   Moreover, if the general public are as punitive in their attitudes to
   offenders, as is commonly thought, how do communities feel when prisons
   are built in their midst? How do architects of prisons balance the
   requirements that prisons should pass the 'public acceptability' test
   (which may include an expectation that they should 'look' and 'feel'
   like places of punishment) with the 'NIMBYism' which frequently greets
   the announcement of a new prison?   This project will empirically
   investigate these issues and inform future debates about how prisons
   might be designed differently in order to fulfill the goal of
   rehabilitation as well as those of security, deterrence, retribution and
   punishment. Challenging conventional wisdom and taken-for-granted
   assumptions concerning the purposes and 'effectiveness' of prisons, the
   proposed project is innovative, significant and timely. No research
   currently exists on the impact and effects - on prison staff as well as
   on inmates - of penal architecture, spatial design and the
   implementation of advanced monitoring, surveillance and communication
   technologies. The study's intent is to move beyond the traditional,
   historical focus on penal architecture e.g. the legacy of Bentham's
   Panopticon and the 19th century 'separate' and 'silent' systems (in
   which the goals of discipline and reform were built in to the fabric of
   the carceral environment), and to inform knowledge and debates from a
   contemporary and future-oriented perspective. In doing this, the
   proposed project promises to deliver significant advances on previous
   research and extant knowledge.

TI Development and pilot testing of a mobile health application to improve
   HIV prevention and substance use treatment service access among women
   involved in the carceral system
DT Awarded Grant
PD Apr 15 2023
PY 2023
AB Project SummaryWomen involved with the carceral system are more at risk
   of HIV infection, substance use disorders, andoverdose than their
   community-based counterparts. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has
   emerged as apowerful HIV-prevention tool and in combination with
   Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) couldsignificantly impact HIV
   and overdose risk. Patient navigation holds strong potential to address
   multifactorialand complex barriers to PrEP and substance use treatment
   linkage and uptake for women involved in thecarceral system. In tandem
   with patient navigation, eHealth has the potential to improve
   healthcareengagement for this group of women. As a multidisciplinary
   team with expertise in HIV-preventionimplementation science research,
   technology enhanced, gender-responsive, and behavioral health
   focused(substance use, mental health and HIV prevention) interventions,
   and intervention development for individualsinvolved in the carceral
   system, we propose to examine the potential impact of using a
   technology-basedadjunct to an existing navigation program to improve
   linkage to PrEP and MOUD for women leaving carceralsettings in
   Philadelphia (PA). Intervention development and study design will be
   guided by our team’s pilot andon-going research, and the EPIS
   Implementation Framework. Study aims are to: 1) Assess women involved
   inthe carceral systems’ perceptions of PrEP and MOUD and potential
   barriers to initiation and adherence; 2)Develop the PA-Links web-based
   app and assess usability and acceptability; and 3) Pilot the
   intervention toassess for promise of efficacy in engaging women involved
   in the carceral systems in PrEP and MOUD byintegrating PA-Links into
   existing patient navigation. A survey of women involved in the carceral
   system andperceptual mapping analyses will be used in Aim 1 to guide
   proto-type app development and user testing in Aim2. In Aim 3, we will
   examine the primary outcome of PrEP and MOUD service linkage and
   secondary outcomessuch as PrEP and MOUD prescription/initiation, PrEP
   and MOUD adherence/persistence, perceptions andknowledge, and
   acceptability of the intervention. A Community Advisory Board will
   inform all aspects of theproposed study. This pilot study will
   significantly contribute to the field of HIV and substance abuse
   treatment byexamining the potential impact of using technology based,
   tailored, gender-responsive interventions in adjunctwith existing
   navigation in an urban, community-based health center. Study results
   will provide crucialinformation for a subsequent R01 proposal to
   rigorously evaluate an urgently needed HIV preventionintervention
   developed specifically to meet the unique cultural and social needs of
   high-risk women.

AB ���DDRIG: Cementing Spaces: The Material That Made Room for New Cultures
   in the Twentieth-Century United States���Timothy J. LeCain, PI;
   Kirke D. Elsass, co-PICement���the substance that binds
   together and solidifies concrete���is indispensable to building modern
   transportation, energy, and residential structures. Global production of
   cement contributes around eight percent of human-caused carbon dioxide
   emissions. Primarily for this reason, chemists and engineers around the
   world seek replacement materials and new building techniques that might
   reduce cement use. ���Cementing Spaces,��� a historical study of cement
   and society, complements and informs the work of those material
   scientists who are rethinking concrete. The study accounts for cement as
   both an environmental element and a cultural element in the past. It
   introduces evidence that conventional cement affected the development of
   cultures in both subtle and profound ways. In short, cement created new
   spaces with which people created new cultures. Studying the cultures
   created with cement in the past provides a framework for industry
   researchers and public officials to consider and anticipate the many
   consequences to society that will ensue from their exploration and
   implementation of alternatives to cement.���Cementing
   Spaces��� focuses on the relative impermeability of cement. Cement���s
   potential to create environmental barriers, cultivated for control of
   water during the nineteenth-century canal era, proved to be an appealing
   and influential quality in a variety of ubiquitous twentieth-century
   structures. Case studies of home basements, public sidewalks, and prison
   cells will employ archived documents to deeply explore the ways cemented
   environments shaped new cultures of family, mobility, and incarceration.
   The project hypothesizes that cement, by separating people from water,
   dirt, or one another, had a role in turning cellars into modern
   basements, inviting new municipal codes and new footwear styles of urban
   life, and supporting carceral authorities��� use of solitary confinement
   as a punitive measure. The findings of ���Cementing Spaces��� will
   contribute to scholarship that reveals how nonhuman things participate
   in the development of societies, here with a novel focus on a material
   technology that despite its ubiquity is not popularly
   understood.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has
   been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's
   intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI Imagining the Border Otherwise: Global engagements with solidarity,
   relationality and survival
DT Awarded Grant
PD Aug 31 2023
PY 2023
AB The proposed project is an original and intellectually urgent project
   that addresses the question of whether, and in what ways, the border
   matters beyond its physical infrastructure. It is an intellectual
   history that excavates the question of borders in the political thought
   of four foundational thinkers: Gloria Anzaldua, Temsula Ao, Jean Genet
   and Huey Newton.  Just as the national border proliferates and expands
   its capacity to enact violence, so does resistance to it. The hardening
   of borders through ever more draconian immigration regimes, expanded
   surveillance apparatuses, militarized border patrols, and border guards
   with broad remits and police powers, has seen a concomitant push back
   against a political status quo and social imaginary structured around
   nation-states that are designed to keep some people out as a way protect
   those within. The people rendered outside the remit of citizenship,
   without a claim to the state and safe haven are locked up in cages,
   detained at will, and left to flounder on seas in the name of 'state
   security' and 'border sanctity'. This we are told is the will of the
   people, with the 'people' (largely) coded as white, heteronormative,
   law-abiding citizens. Human rights lawyers, migrant support NGOs,
   refugee councils, and scholars working on border-crossings and the
   politics of (im)mobility that enable and shape the movement of people
   have meticulously documented the harm caused by ossified national
   borders and the security regimes that underpin them. Whilst this
   critique is not new, there has been a renewed interest in the safety and
   well-being of people caught in the crossfires of the battle between
   often despotic regimes and hostile or unwelcoming states. For those
   defending these people without access (even if they legally have the
   'rights') as well as for the people themselves, the national border
   signifies a site of blockage, stoppage, and violence. The border
   restricts entry, looming large in this imaginary as a, if not the,
   culprit in a long list of crimes against innocent people fleeing
   persecution, intimidation, or a life without hope. The opening up of
   national borders then becomes the logical solution to this state of
   affairs, with some agitating for border abolition as not merely the most
   radical but also the most utile option.   This project is sympathetic to
   many of the claims of border sceptics and abolitionists, whilst at the
   same time striving to open out the conversation about the national
   border in order to examine its entanglements with other technologies of
   racial capitalism, not least private property and policing. Looking at
   borderlands and frontiers as generative spaces that teach us something
   about the limits of a border imaginary, it invites diverse audiences
   (academics, practitioners, policy makers) to tarry with the thought of
   four mid-twentieth century writers, who were already imagining a
   different way of resisting, rejecting, as well as surviving with the
   border. The four scholar-activists: Anzaldua, Ao, Genet, and Newton, all
   offer insights into the multiple ways in which borders - primarily
   national but not solely - condition existence in a manner that is at
   once disruptive and creative. Working with and through their thought,
   Thinking the Border Otherwise tries to carefully navigate the many
   debates and issues animating border studies as an academic field today,
   as well as engaging with wider concerns around the nature of security,
   racial capitalism, private property and the abolition of carceral
   systems that affect lived realities of people around the world. It does
   not pretend to offer a quick fix or even a long-term readymade solution
   to the many ills plaguing our common existence, but rather seeks solace
   in the promise of a future imagined by those that came before. Rather
   than mourn the loss of this potential future, the research builds on
   their expansive visions to argue that that another world is not just
   possible, it is also necessary.

TI Doctoral Dissertation Grant: A History of the American Cement and
   Concrete Industries
DT Awarded Grant
PD Jun 01 2020
PY 2020
AB This award supports a proposal for a doctoral dissertation research
   project to develop a history of concrete that includes its global,
   material, and cultural aspects. The project will examine how American
   businessmen, scientists, and workers defined good concrete, and how they
   transmitted the material, the technologies necessary for its
   manufacture, and the knowledge about labor practices to different
   building communities around the world. The project supported by this
   award will track the discovery of cement rock in the Lehigh Valley of
   Pennsylvania, the expansion of the industry to the American South, the
   formation of the concrete empire in the Global South, and the potential
   use of concrete for colonizing outer space. The dissertation argues that
   for cement to be successful, it had to mix with other industries like
   agriculture, the military, and science to spread invisibly and seemingly
   naturally. Funding will be used to conduct research at government,
   private, and university archives. The dissertation argues that for
   cement to be successful, it had to mix with other industries like
   agriculture, the military, and science to spread invisibly and seemingly
   naturally. Funding will be used to conduct research at government,
   private, and university archives. The results of this research are to be
   presented at professional conferences and published in peer-reviewed
   journals. They will also serve to illuminate the extent to which
   materials selected for building efforts have a significant impact on
   neighboring residents; in doing so, they may serve to empower members of
   the general public to participate in environmental monitoring, to engage
   in broader conversations about air quality, and to participate in
   scientific knowledge production. Such activities are especially
   important for marginalized communities, which have been historically
   relegated to living in polluted regions often without knowledge of its
   looming toxicity.This research project will support a history
   of technology project that examines the American cement and concrete
   industries. Unlike coal and other alike industrial substances that have
   received extensive historical coverage, concrete has been ignored under
   the assumption that it lacks history and importance. By taking concrete
   itself as the key problematic, as opposed to its testing or use in
   design, the results of this project will contribute to the growing
   literature on the movement of materials across the world and their
   political and environmental consequences. In addition to introducing
   concrete to Science and Technology Studies scholarship, it may serve to
   transform the field by expanding how scholars think about the
   development of knowledge communities. The project shows that to
   understand the complexity of knowledge communities, scholars need to
   look beyond professional hierarchies and think about the physical,
   bodily, and geographical networks of people and places. By rooting the
   experiences of scientists, quarrymen, carceral laborers, farmers, and
   soldiers in the material geographies of concrete manufacture, this
   project will reveal how cement and concrete industries constructed ideas
   about skill, knowledge, and who was able to acquire it.This
   award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of
   support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and
   broader impacts review criteria.
