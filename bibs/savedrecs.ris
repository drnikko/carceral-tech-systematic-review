TI  - Rewiring the Prison: Early Radio as a Carceral Technology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Federal prisons in the early 20th century used the technology of radio for distinct ends. The prison at Atlanta facilitated a broadcast concert at the local radio station, with an entirely incarcerated band. At Leavenworth, in Kansas, a warden tried to maintain control over his facility by permitting long radio listening hours for prisoners through individual headsets wired into cells rather than in areas where people could gather. Meanwhile, prison educators believed radio to be a powerful tool in their mission to reform their subjects. This moment of indetermination-for both radio and the new Federal Bureau of Prisons-offers insight into the role of media in the practice of incarceration, as well as in the struggle against it.

TI  - The carceral appropriation of communications technology through the imaginal
T2  - PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article explores the effect that communications technology has on hegemonic power. The first section establishes a theoretical framework combining Foucault's carceral archipelago theory with Chiara Bottici's concept of the social imaginal describing the medium through which inter- and trans-subjective imagination occurs. The remainder employs this framework to examine how four technological innovations (print media, radio, television and Internet) impact the (re)production of discursive hegemonic ideology, integrating a variety of historical and contemporary theories on public discourse and ideological dominance. I conclude by arguing that each case demonstrates a dialectic pattern that explains the techno-social evolution of the carceral archipelago.

TI  - Gendering the carceral web: Public sector reform, technology and digital (in)justice
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The UK government's Transforming Our Justice System agenda represents an emerging system of penal governance. Its cumulative impact, manifested through the mainstreaming of virtual hearings, a system of automatic online convictions and the Single Justice Procedure is a story yet to tell, with the potential impact on marginalised women simply a footnote. Such women, well-documented victims of the legal aid cuts as well as the digital divide, must comply with and negotiate the requirements of the carceral web alone. Pursuance of the reforms, representing the next instalment in the neo-liberal justice agenda, exposes another example of life at the penal-welfare nexus. This precarious territory has burgeoned since government-imposed austerity, with implications for self-criminalisation, net-widening and social justice. Reforms couched in the language of 'efficiency' and 'common sense' are likely to run in direct opposition to what marginalised women might need (or respond well to) and may jeopardise official reductionist strategies.

TI  - The Datafication of Law: How Technology Encodes Carceral Power and Affects Judicial Practice in the United States
T2  - LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This inquiry explores how data analyses about US Federal sentences have transformed sentencing practice beginning in the mid-1980s. I consider this inquiry an early case of the datafication of law, a pervasive process that translates legal practice into data and embeds it in digital networks so it can be tracked and analyzed in real time. To explore datafication historically and in relation to legal practice and power, I consider it not as an objective and passive undertaking but, rather, as an ideological and performative process that encodes and enacts normative presumptions and desirable futures. The empirical inquiry traverses "levels of analysis" and thus bridges prominent perspectives in sociolegal research. In so doing, I identify four mechanisms that mediate "large-scale" processes and "local" practices: field assembly, symbolic projection, material inscription, and boundaries spanning. Substantively, I show how datafication has not simply described, but also transformed, sentencing practice according to a colorblind-carceral imaginary that strives to fix the present in place. By relentlessly translating decisions into data forms that derive from this carceral imaginary, datafication affects judicial action and partakes in sustaining legacies of oppression. Yet, like other technologies, datafication also reveals dialectic dimensions in opening up to new actors and subjecting its ideological underpinnings to contestation and change.

TI  - Race as technology and the carceral methodologies of molecular racialization
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article counters the view (albeit contested) of race as a natural empirical object with technology as a secondary, external entity applied to it. Instead, I posit race itself as a technology that is inherently discriminatory in motivation, design and function, as evident throughout its brutally effective history. Focusing on the post/genomic era, I consider contemporary forms of molecular racialization as the latest technological iteration of race as a disciplinary device. I characterize this biopolitical racial technology as operant through a carceral methodology in four stages: (a) the epistemological mutability of molecular racialization as reiterating the obscurantist claim of modern raciology to constitute a benign description of literal racial difference; (b) the ontological de-individualization of certain racial others as aggregated risky populations and legitimate targets of repressive management; (c) a predictive empiricism whereby molecular race is seen as indicative of potential behaviours that sanctions oppressive state interventions against specific populations; (d) a normative bioethical dissembling whereby state agencies' exploitation of target molecular racialized populations' vulnerabilities result in the debarment of proper ethical consideration and the right to justice. Drawing largely on criminal justice and immigration control examples, the article asserts that the carceral methodologies of molecular racialization demonstrate race as a repressive technology designed to (re)produce subaltern racial populations and propagate racism.

TI  - Pains of privacy: Mapping carceral practices onto electronic monitoring
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars and policymakers have long debated whether electronic monitoring programs can be understood as a carceral experience. Recent changes to the technology that utilize 24/7 location monitoring through GPS are changing the nature of electronic monitoring. Given these changes, this article revisits the question of the "pains" of electronic monitoring and its comparison to incarceration. I focus on three practices of electronic monitoring programs: home searches, communication monitoring, and long-term data storage to illustrate the ways in which the loss of autonomy, one of Sykes's original pains of imprisonment, is reproduced and remade. Rather than focusing on the aspects of programs that confine or limit the mobility of individuals, I draw on the tradition in carceral geography to consider how these practices recreate carcerality in new spaces and highlight the ways in which the experience of electronic monitoring is made carceral through the privacy intrusions and infringements to the self.

TI  - THE CARCERAL HOME
T2  - BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In virtually all areas of law, the home is the ultimate constitutionally protected area, at least in theory. In practice, a range of modern institutions that target private life-from public housing to child welfare-have turned the home into a routinely surveilled space. Indeed, for the 4.5 million people on criminal court supervision, their home is their prison, or what I call a "carceral home." Often in the name of decarceration, prison walls are replaced with restrictive rules that govern every aspect of private life and invasive surveillance technology that continuously records intimate information. While prisons have always been treated in the law as sites of punishment and diminished privacy, homes have not. Yet in the carceral home people have little privacy in the place where they presumptively should have the most. If progressive state interventions are to continue, some amount of home surveillance is surely inevitable. But these trends raise a critical, underexplored question: When the home is carceral, what is, or should be, left of the home as a protected area? This Article addresses that question. Descriptively, it draws on a fifty-state analysis of court supervision rules to reveal the extent of targeted invasions of intimate life in the name of rehabilitation or an alternative to prison, rendering the home a highly surveilled space. Normatively, it argues that allowing this state of affairs with no corresponding adaptations in legal doctrine is untenable.

TI  - Credit Scoring as a Carceral Practice: An Abolitionist Framework
T2  - RACE AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of credit scoring is ubiquitous in today's economy. Three-digit credit scores or their underlying data are applied well beyond the lending decisions for which they were originally designed and are routinely used in the contexts of employment, housing, and more. Drawing on carceral logics and abolitionist politics, we develop a framework to critically interpret the practice of credit scoring. We theorize credit scoring as a carceral practice and technology in the afterlife of slavery that expands anti-black discipline and punishment. We suggest that credit scoring is incapable of objectively assessing risk and that claims of objectivity legitimize an exploitative system of evaluation that mediates people's access to the means of survival. Moreover, credit scoring expands the scope of how people are conscripted into consumerism and disciplined and punished under racial capitalism. We review research literature on credit scoring as a step toward applying this framework and demonstrate how research provides an alibi for anti-black racism embedded in contemporary credit scores. We conclude with a call to abolish the practice of credit scoring and imagine new, abolitionist alternatives for people to live safely and with dignity.

AB  - Purpose of Review To describe existing evidence and identify future directions for intervention research related to improving HIV care outcomes for persons with HIV involved in the carceral system in the USA, a population with high unmet HIV care needs.Recent Findings Few recent intervention studies focus on improving HIV care outcomes for this population. Successful strategies to improve care outcomes include patient navigation, substance use treatment, and incentivizing HIV care outcomes. Technology-supported interventions are underutilized in this population. Notable gaps in the existing literature include intervention research addressing HIV care needs for cisgender and transgender women and those under carceral supervision in the community.Summary Future research should address existing gaps in the literature and respond to emergent needs including understanding how the changing HIV care delivery environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the approval of new injectable ART formulation shape HIV care outcomes in this population.

TI  - Refusal in Data Ethics: Re-Imagining the Code Beneath the Code of Computation in the Carceral State
T2  - ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of a growing interest in ethical approaches to computation, engineers and quantitative researchers are often not equipped with the conceptual tools necessary to interrogate, resist, and reimagine the relationships of power which shape their work. A liberatory vision of computation requires de-centering the data in "data ethics" in favor of cultivating an ethics of encounter that foregrounds the ways computation reproduces structures of domination. This article draws from a rich body of feminist scholarship that explores the liberatory potential of refusal as a practice of generative boundary setting. To refuse is to say no-to reject the default categories, assumptions and problem formulations which so often underpin dataintensive work. But refusal is more than just saying no; it can be a generative and strategic act, one which opens up space to renegotiate the assumptions underlying sociotechnical endeavors. This article explores two complementary modalities of refusal in computation: "refusal as resistance" and "refusal as recentering the margins." By exploring these two modes of refusal, the goal of this paper is to provide a vocabulary for identifying and rejecting the ways that sociotechnical systems reinforce dependency on oppressive structural conditions, as well as offer a framework for flexible collective experimentation towards more free futures.

TI  - Death in a Black Maria: Transport as punishment in an African carceral state
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In March 1980, fifty men suffocated to death in the back of a police van, known as a Black Maria, in Lagos, Nigeria. In the Black Maria Tragedy, as it came to be called, several currents of Nigeria's postcolonial history converged. They included the persistent problem of crime, the question of how much power to give men in uniform, and the problems of migration and regional integration (most of the victims came from neighboring countries). This article examines the 1980 incident not only for what it reveals about Nigeria, but about the larger workings of punishment in a postcolonial state. What techniques of punishment endured after the end of colonialism? Which of them did African governments find useful, and which did they discard? Where did the technology of the Black Maria come from, and what part did it play in the machinery of the Nigerian state? Looking beyond Nigeria, the Black Maria incident suggests that prison transport is an important part of the carceral landscape - and one that is easy to miss.

AB  - This article provides an analysis of sonic protest strategies used by anti-carceral feminist coalitions in Melbourne, Australia. Our research demonstrates that sound is a particularly powerful boundary-crosser that can challenge the exclusionary spatial ordering of the prison. Under certain political and geographical conditions, the carceral soundscape, which increasingly restricts 'who gets to hear what', can be temporarily breached, altered and re-made by protest noise, rhythm and music, and radio technology. Counter-carceral acoustemologies create alternative 'soundtracks' of resistance that both reveal and momentarily displace carceral-spatial control, re-patterning the aural environment of the prison. Such breaches can be countered, however, by various modes of boundary fortification over time. We propose that a more nuanced understanding of carceral space and soundscapes-as relational and in flux-provides greater opportunities for denaturalizing the prison and challenging its seeming permanence in our political and cultural landscapes.

TI  - Making mothers in jail: carceral reproduction of normative motherhood.
T2  - Reproductive biomedicine & society online
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The over-reliance on incarceration in the USA is a racialized phenomenon which has affected millions of families - disproportionately people of colour - reconfiguring kinship around the criminal legal system. Mass incarceration, then, disrupts conventional modes of reproduction and threatens reproductive justice, separates families and funnels children into foster care, diverts funds from social services into prisons, restricts women's access to abortion and adequate pregnancy care, shackles women in childbirth, and incarcerates people during their prime reproductive years. Beyond these obvious disruptions to reproduction, incarceration also cultivates certain ways of being a parent. Much of the critical literature on mass incarceration focuses on men, largely because of fewer women and masculinist assumptions of the carceral system. This paper looks specifically at how women's reproduction is experienced and managed by carceral institutions, and how mass incarceration itself is a reproductive technology. Based on ethnographic fieldwork at a women's jail, I explore pregnancy and motherhood behind bars. Certain types of mothering are foreclosed, while an idealized version of maternal identity is simultaneously promoted. For many incarcerated women, jail is the only place where they can experience this form of motherhood, as forces of structural violence outside of jail often limit their ability to parent, such as involvement of child welfare institutions, addiction and homelessness. The myriad ways in which incarcerated women's reproduction is suppressed and enabled is a critical lens through which to understand how institutions and forces of racial oppression reinforce idealized notions of motherhood while making them categorically unattainable.

TI  - Information and communications technology access for people in prison: strategies to maximise the benefits and minimise the harms of communication with families and program workers
T2  - CURRENT ISSUES IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 lockdowns accelerated the take up of video calls and other digital communication between people in prison and the outside world. This has altered relationships with families and practice within rehabilitative and reintegration services. Little work has discussed the significance of these changes or articulated a normative agenda for shaping changes in future. This article aims to identify strategies that might help reintegration services and justice system agencies maximise the benefits and minimise the harms from information communication technology (ICT) use between people in prison and their families and services. Drawing from empirical literature, practical insights from service delivery and theoretical insights from assemblage theory and carceral geography, this article proposes three strategies: design spatial, scheduling and security measures to minimise stigma and disruption; actively support ICT users to equitably access the potential of ICT systems; and develop program practices in parallel with the evolutions of the technology they employ. Each of these strategies is set out with sub-components and suggestions for further research.

TI  - Informal Technology Education for Women Transitioning from Incarceration
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, womenin-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 womenin-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants' feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.

TI  - Prison, technology, and consumption: A visual study of the use of electronic commerce strategies in the inmate package industry
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the US penal system has increasingly contracted prison services and introduced electronic commerce technologies for penal populations and their social networks. This study uses visual and textual analysis of 245 images from the websites of 17 inmate package companies to explore electronic commerce strategies in US penal institutions. The inmate package industry uses electronic commerce strategies that address the distinctive conditions of penal confinement and deploys emotionally charged messages to encourage digital interactions with the penal system and elicit consumption. Several company websites also organize the experience of consumption along gender and racial lines. The emergent industry of inmate packages represents one among several contemporary practices of carceral consumption.

TI  - Violence and Carceral Masculinities in Felony Fights
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary culture is replete with carnivalesque representations of violence and this has accelerated with the development of online technology. Felony Fights is a website and set of DVDs depicting real combat between male former convicts and other men. Viewer responses to these clips reflect a complexity of meaning and symbolic associations between violence, power and masculine identities. Nevertheless, profoundly unequal relations of power shape their production and viewing appeal. The embodied and affective dimensions of marginality and poverty are presented in Felony Fights as evidence of the animal brutality and carceral character of the fighters. This resonates with populist explanations for criminal violence and mainstream portrayals of male masochism in which white men are depicted as a victimized social group.

TI  - Surviving With Digital Imperial Shackles: Community-Engaged Oral History of Asian Migrant Massage Workers in U.S. Human Trafficking Laws
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION INQUIRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigates the impact of human trafficking laws and digital carceral technologies on Asian migrant massage workers in the United States. Drawing on community-engaged oral histories and my advocacy in human trafficking legal cases, it highlights the survival strategies these workers adopt in response to digital carceral surveillance. The paper introduces the concept of the digital imperial shackle, which reveals the punitive mechanisms of racialized, sexual, migrant, and moral control within U.S. imperialism. Despite the constraints of these digital carceral systems, Asian migrant massage workers utilize non-digital strategies to navigate their daily lives. This research reinterprets their survival tactics as a form of visceral knowledge, challenging the prevailing discourses on the intersection of digital technology, trafficking, and anti-sex work regimes.

TI  - Digital expulsions. Refugees' carcerality and the technological disruptions of asylum
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING C-POLITICS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing the notion of "digital expulsions", this paper argues that digital technologies in refugee humanitarianism are mainly used for hampering migrants from becoming asylum seekers and getting access to rights. Focusing on Greece, it explores which carceral mechanisms are enforced and sustained through the incorporation of digital technologies in refugee governmentality: it contends that it is key to investigate the specific harms that digital technologies generate on asylum seekers. The article intertwines scholarship on digital technologies in migration governance with carceral geography literature and shows that carceral mechanisms are enacted also through digital technologies. The paper draws attention to how in Greece asylum seekers' access to the asylum procedure and to financial and humanitarian support is further obstructed due to forced technological intermediations. In the second part, it investigates refugees' carcerality considering the increasing use of technology in refugee camps and in the asylum procedures: it contends that carceral mechanisms enforced beyond detention and shows that these work by debilitating and choking refugees' lives and stealing their lifetime.

TI  - Personal Health Libraries for People Returning From Incarceration: Protocol for a Qualitative Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Individuals released from carceral facilities have high rates of hospitalization and death, especially in the weeks immediately after their return to community settings. During this transitional process, individuals leaving incarceration are expected to engage with multiple providers working in separate, complex systems, including health care clinics, social service agencies, community-based organizations, and probation and parole services. This navigation is often complicated by individuals' physical and mental health, literacy and fluency, and socioeconomic status. Personal health information technology, which can help people access and organize their health information, could improve the transition from carceral systems to the community and mitigate health risks upon release. Yet, personal health information technologies have not been designed to meet the needs and preferences of this population nor tested for acceptability or use.Objective: The objective of our study is to develop a mobile app to create personal health libraries for individuals returning from incarceration to help bridge the transition from carceral settings to community living.Methods: Participants were recruited through Transitions Clinic Network clinic encounters and professional networking with justice-involved organizations. We used qualitative research methods to assess the facilitators and barriers to developing and using personal health information technology for individuals returning from incarceration. We conducted individual interviews with people just released from carceral facilities (n= similar to 20) and providers (n=similar to 10) from the local community and carceral facilities involved with the transition for returning community members. We used rigorous rapid qualitative analysis to generate thematic output characterizing the unique circumstances impacting the development and use of personal health information technology for individuals returning from incarceration and to identify content and features for the mobile app based on the preferences and needs of our participants.Results: As of February 2023, we have completed 27 qualitative interviews with individuals recently released from carceral systems (n=20) and stakeholders (n=7) who support justice-involved individuals from various organizations in the community.Conclusions: We anticipate that the study will characterize the experiences of people transitioning from prison and jails to community settings; describe the information, technology resources, and needs upon reentry to the community; and create potential pathways for fostering engagement with personal health information technology.

TI  - Digital Platforms and the Maintenance of the Urban Order
T2  - SOCIAL PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Neighborhood digital platforms - such as Nextdoor, Citizen, Neighbors, anti-crime Facebook groups, Ring surveillance technology, and 311 see-click-fix applications - are recent entrants into urban life. Existing accounts suggest they help build intra-community relationships, but that they also amplify paranoia, racism, and carceral impulses of American homeowners. We ask: how is the new technology increasing solidarity and exclusionary impulses, and what role does it play in the changing American urban landscape? Using offline and online ethnography of one community's year-long contestation over public space, we find that three effects of the platforms help explain the maintenance of urban order in this case. First, the platforms push residents to see disparate instances of urban disorder as a linked manifestation of organized crime. Second, the platforms help to turn fleeting and uncorroborated accounts into durable events that foster community efficacy. Third, by increasing perceptions of urban disorder and greater community efficacy, the platforms facilitate the accrual of offline material resources. We suggest that in highly contested areas of American cities - areas where wealthy residents vie with a largely Brown and Black working-class for use of space - neighborhood digital platforms help to funnel services that support property value into smaller sections of otherwise disinvested neighborhoods.

TI  - The Migrant and Marginalized Body in Connection with Digital Technologies as a Prosthesis of the Monstrous
T2  - FILOZOFSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - This article situates the (human) body as a signifier for society at large, arguing that developments in many societies of structural and systematic violence that targets minorities such as refugees and first nation peoples, points to a failure of democratic values. Using two examples, we elaborate technology and digital devices as prosthesis of the body, that are also acting as proxy for state violence. The first example is from the carceral archipelago of Manus Island as a site of remote detention of refugees carried out by the Australian government. Refugees held on Manus Island describe the treatment they experience as torture. The second example is drawn from the Australian mainland, telling the stories of First Nations children subjected to abuse and violence in juvenile detention centers. A judicial inquiry (Royal Commission) found that a systematic approach aimed at punishing children constituted torture. The concepts developed in this article are those of bordering and racialization, while the intertwining of human and '' more than human life '' helps to understand and challenge the necropolitical power evident in (liberal) capitalism.

TI  - Numbering and Boat IDs: The Dehumanizing Use of ID Numbers in Australia's Border Regime
T2  - DESIGN AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of identifying people by ID numbers rather than their names, which the authors term here "numbering," has been extensively recorded in carceral and bordering institutions. While the argument for using identification numbers (ID numbers) is that they enable the reliable mapping between a person and designated institutional artifacts, according to people who have been subjected to numbering, its effect is to dehumanize, erasing individuals' identities so that they might be more effectively abused as objects. To explore these logics, our article provides a critical reading of Boat IDs in Australia's notorious border regime based on the first-hand accounts of people subjected to numbering. We apply a 'technology-in-practice' lens to analyze ID numbers as biopolitical apparatuses of carceral recognition and erasure that work to materialize power relations of domination and subjugation.

AB  - As dating apps continue to receive pressure from civil society, media and governments to address a range of safety concerns, technology companies have developed and deployed a spate of new safety features. Taken together, these features rely upon increased surveillance and partnerships with both technology start-up companies and law enforcement agencies proposed as responses to sexual harassment and abuse. In this article, we draw on empirical accounts of app use - and popular media reporting - to problematise commonsense assumptions about dating apps, safety, technology, policing and surveillance. Where so-called safety features involve increased surveillance and techno-carceral solutionism, there is potential to make users less safe - particularly for app users who are marginalised or stigmatised on the basis of their race, sexuality, gender, health status, employment or disability. Instead of the impetus to 'datafy' consent by documenting evidence of sexual transactions, or to monitor users by sharing data with police, we argue that a more effective approach to safety must extend the notion of 'consent culture' to encompass a consent-based approach to collecting, storing, and sharing user data - including seeking consent from users about how and whether their data is sold, monetised or shared with third parties or law enforcement.

TI  - Anti-Trafficking in the Time of FOSTA/SESTA: Networked Moral Gentrification and Sexual Humanitarian Creep
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, sex workers have highlighted the harms that accompany anti-prostitution efforts advanced via anti-trafficking policy, and there is a growing body of social science research that has emerged documenting how anti-trafficking efforts contribute to carceral and sexual humanitarian interventions. Yet mounting evidence on the harms of anti-trafficking policies has done little to quell the passage of more laws, including policies aimed at stopping sexual exploitation facilitated by technology. The 2018 passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the corresponding Senate bill, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), is a case study in how efforts to curb sexual exploitation online actually heighten vulnerabilities for the people they purport to protect. Drawing on 34 months of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with sex workers and trafficked persons (n = 58) and key informants (n = 20) in New York and Los Angeles, we analyze FOSTA/SESTA and its harmful effects as a launchpad to more broadly explore how technology, criminalization, shifting governance arrangements, and conservative moralities cohere to exacerbate sex workers' vulnerability.

TI  - Neurobiologically Poor? Brain Phenotypes, Inequality, and Biosocial Determinism
T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rise of neuroplasticity has led to new fields of study about the relation between social inequalities and neurobiology, including investigations into the "neuroscience of poverty." The neural phenotype of poverty proposed in recent neuroscientific research emerges out of classed, gendered, and racialized inequalities that not only affect bodies in material ways but also shape scientific understandings of difference. An intersectional, sociomaterial approach is needed to grasp the implications of neuroscientific research that aims to both produce and repair neurobiological difference. Following Benjamin's critique of the "carceral imagination" of technoscience, this article considers how such research may fix in terms of helping, or in contrast, fix by classifying and reifying, vulnerable subjects. I address the potential for biosocial determinism in linking neural phenotypes and social problems. I use an intersectional approach to consider the presence and absence of race in this body of research and explore how some methodological and conceptual framings of the "brain on poverty" mark poor and minority children for intervention in concert with neoliberal approaches to poverty.

TI  - The Rise of the Airport Metal Detector: Colorblind Racism, Police Discretion, and Surveillance Across Borders
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal detectors became ubiquitous throughout the United States after their use in airports during the late-1960s and early 1970s when they were installed to address hijackings. While earlier perceptions of the technology's invasiveness prevented the metal detector's deployment in the United States beyond jails and prisons, security officials came to identify the device as a means to address the carceral-security state's legitimacy crises and square mass surveillance with demands for civil and political rights. Those designing and implementing the first airport security program understood hijackings as elements of global rebellions against U.S. empire and drew from policing efforts at home and abroad in their efforts to securitize airports. Officials and courts argued that the universality and objectivity of the machine that determined potential danger solely through the presence of metal removed individual police discretion and was thus race-neutral. Claims of the technology's novelty not only obscured its carceral and counterinsurgent origins but helped propel the metal detector's deployment to new spaces including public schools and workplaces. The metal detector reproduced existing class and racial hierarchies and strengthened police discretionary authority.

AB  - How should society respond to police surveillance technologies? This question has been at the center of national debates around facial recognition, predictive policing, and digital tracking technologies. It is a debate that has divided activists, law enforcement officials, and academics and will be a central question for years to come as police surveillance technology grows in scale and scope. Do you trust police to use the technology without regulation? Do you ban surveillance technology as a manifestation of discriminatory carceral power that cannot be reformed? Can you regulate police surveillance with a combination of technocratic rules, policies, audits, and legal reforms? This Article explores the taxonomy of past approaches to policing technologies and-finding them all lacking-offers the "tyrant test" as an alternative.The tyrant test focuses on power. Because surveillance technology offers government a new power to monitor and control citizens, the response must check that power. The question is how, and the answer is to assume the worst. Power will be abused, and constraints must work backwards from that cynical starting point. The tyrant test requires institutional checks that decenter government power into overlapping community institutions with real authority and enforceable individual rights.The tyrant test borrows its structure from an existing legal framework also designed to address the rise of a potentially tyrannical power-the U.S. Constitution and, more specifically, the Fourth Amendment. Fearful of a centralized federal government with privacy invading intentions, the Fourth Amendment-as metaphor and methodology-offers a guide to approaching surveillance; it allows some technologies but only within a self-reinforcing system of structural checks and balances with power centered in opposition to government. The fear of tyrannical power motivated the original Fourth Amendment and still offers lessons for how society should address the growth of powerful, new surveillance technologies.

TI  - Virtual Reality & Youth Incarceration: Methodological Reflections from a Media Education & Research Program
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This research aimed to provide young people in a juvenile rehabilitation centre (JRC) with access and exposure to virtual reality (VR) as a growing media technology industry, to offer media education that was fun and engaging, and to introduce the digital arts to participants as a potential career path. The project evolved through a partnership with the Washington State Librarian who, as a part of her role overseeing public library activities, wanted to ensure that newly acquired VR equipment was made available to as many people as possible. This effort included libraries within sites of incarceration. Analysis: This article presents a reflective and analytical discussion on the success and challenges of creating, implementing, and researching a VR art design program in a JRC. Conclusions and implications: Carceral logics are entangled in research and education, in constant tension with anti-oppressive methods in place. Improvisational action as a design method in media education programs, including VR art design with incarcerated youth, may support greater participation and stronger research outcomes.

The culturally sustaining and trauma-sensitive course, delivered asynchronously via tablets, was a survey of contemporary art. Because of a quarantine in response to the COVID pandemic, the class had the opportunity to use technology that is new to carceral spaces. The advantages and problems will be discussed. This article will close with practical recommendations for educators seeking to provide similar programming.

T2  - HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1946 Bataan Rice Enrichment Project illuminates the intimate connections between Euro-American empire, scientific nationalism, and post-war demonstration in the Philippines. The project was conducted by former American colonial chemist turned philanthropist Robert R. Williams, who sought to prove the efficacy of synthetic-thiamine fortified rice in the fight against beriberi. Yet by willfully exposing half of Bataan's food scarce residents to beriberi, Williams effectively recreated the prisons and asylums that Euro-American researchers had used as living laboratories to induce beriberi in unwilling subjects. These 'carceral laboratories' were highly contested by the people imprisoned within and by nationalist Philippine physicians who understood deficiency disease as a symptom of colonialism. Returning the carceral laboratory to the making of nutritional science explains the post-war Philippine rejection of mandatory rice fortification and is a reminder that the Asian countryside was a creation of colonial modernity and a contested space long before the Cold War.

TI  - Disciplining bystanders: (anti)carcerality, ethics, and the docile subject in HarassMap's "the harasser is a criminal" media campaign in Egypt
T2  - FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Theorizing situates bystander intervention approaches to combatting street sexual harassment as either an anti-carceral mode of social justice concerned with citizen responsibility and reshaping community norms or a carceral practice that shifts forms and sites of penal power. This article examines the intersection and effect of carceral and anti-carceral framing techniques in the 2015 "The Harasser is a Criminal" media campaign deployed by the Egyptian anti-sexual harassment initiative HarassMap to promote bystander intervention. Situated within a sphere of Egyptian gender activism that is transnational, secular, and feminist-oriented, and operating within a militarized, authoritarian political context, HarassMap's campaign complicates how bystander intervention is instrumentalized as a technology of power to shape subjective and intersubjective responses to Egypt's street sexual harassment problem. Carceral and anti-carceral currents flow together in their campaign not to promote a reliance on police or juridical structures for redress, but to cultivate new ethical dispositions as a means of mobilizing individuals to act. Through the figure of the bystander, HarassMap is engaged in a biopolitical project which seeks to create new neoliberal subjects who police themselves and assume responsibility for their own behavior in public space.

TI  - COOL IT! The objective racism of carceral technofixes
T2  - CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Technofixes that promise to improve racism in the prison industrial complex (PIC) frequently perpetuate it instead. This article argues that carceral technofixes undermine their promises when they attempt to solve social problems by pacifying the people that these problems affect. It offers a reading of physicist Alvin Weinberg's writings on technofixes, which, he believed, could improve social problems better than people because they appeared objective. This appearance emerged through the process of scientific reduction, which simplifies social complexity to help designers identify symptoms of problems amenable to technological intervention. This article claims that scientific reduction orients technofixes to make systemic power in the PIC invisible and to silence radical calls for system reform. I explore these tendencies through two examples: (1) Weinberg's hypothesis that air conditioning could prevent Black uprisings in the 1960s and (2) the COMPAS recidivism algorithm at use in Florida today, which attempts to pacify critics of the PIC by framing the subjective assessments of judges as the source of racist sentencing disparities. The article also shows how COMPAS limited radical critiques of the PIC even after it reproduced racist sentencing disparities as it directed the conversation of algorithmic racism around questions of algorithmic fairness, transparency, and accountability.

TI  - Towards Anti-Carceral Leadership: Remaking Public Schools to Refuse Black Students' Surveillance, Containment, and Control
T2  - EDUCATIONAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The social movement for #PoliceFreeSchools (and the adjacent campaign on college and university campuses called #PoliceFreeCampuses) welcomes an opportunity to reimagine school discipline and safety in contradistinction to current carceral forms. Scholars have moved away from notions of "school to prison pipeline" by demonstrating the many ways schools are organized as carceral spaces (e.g., school-prison nexus). A conceptual framework of Anti-carceral leadership is put forward in this paper to underscore the need for a leadership paradigm that actively refuses the logics of the carceral state (e.g., social control). The paper underscores how the logics of antiblackness may sustain mechanisms of social control in education policy intended to undo racialized harm. The tensions of be(com)ing an anti-carceral leader and its significance for undoing technologies of punishment, confinement, and constraint that reinforce schooling as a site of Black pain and suffering are discussed.

TI  - From Coercive to Carceral Conservation: Reframing Conservation through Abolition Ecologies
T2  - ANTIPODE
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical social science research on conservation practice has long articulated the tactics that emerge out of a history of carcerality, environmental racism, colonialism, and violence against oppressed peoples. Despite these critiques, there has been little change in how conservation is conceptualised and implemented, resulting in the continuation of violence, racism, and injustice. Abolition ecologies offer a framework to see the world through a carceral lens and imagine an abolitionist future for conservation. Using Kenya as a case study, we outline the three ways that carcerality is apparent in and integral to contemporary conservation practices: legal/juridical, technoscience, and privatisation. Illuminating the carcerality of conservation practices, we posit, allows scholars and practitioners to begin to imagine and work towards a more just and liberatory conservation movement, one that minimises the perpetuation and reproduction of white supremacy, violence, and environmental injustice.

TI  - Examining the intersection of carceral space and well-being: Correctional officers' perspectives on old and new prison design
T2  - CANADIAN GEOGRAPHIES-GEOGRAPHIES CANADIENNES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study, we explored the prison design and infrastructural changes that Canadian correctional officers consider to be essential in the construction of a new provincial correctional institution intended to replace Her Majesty's Penitentiary (HMP) in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Analyzing 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with correctional officers employed at HMP, we found the poor working conditions within HMP are, at least in part, related to the physical design of the prison, including inadequate lighting, poor air quality and temperature, high sound levels, and other spatial limitations. Building on the prison design literature, findings suggest that while prison design requires attention to physical security at the forefront, there are ways to improve the space, recognizing how an uncomfortable workplace and living conditions also pose a potential threat to the well-being and safety of correctional officers and people who are incarcerated.Dans cette & eacute;tude, nous explorons l'am & eacute;nagement et l'architecture des prisons et les changements & agrave; ceux-ci que les agents correctionnels consid & egrave;rent essentiels. Nous prenons pour exemple la construction d'un nouvel & eacute;tablissement p & eacute;nitentiaire destin & eacute; & agrave; remplacer le Her Majesty's Penitentiary (HMP) dans la province de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador. En analysant les 28 entrevues semi-structur & eacute;es men & eacute;es avec des agents correctionnels employ & eacute;s au HMP, nous avons constat & eacute; que les mauvaises conditions de travail sont, au moins en partie, caus & eacute;es par les caract & eacute;ristiques d'am & eacute;nagement de la prison, notamment un & eacute;clairage inad & eacute;quat, une qualit & eacute; de l'air m & eacute;diocre, une temp & eacute;rature inad & eacute;quate, des niveaux sonores & eacute;lev & eacute;s, etc. En s'appuyant sur la litt & eacute;rature sur l'am & eacute;nagement des p & eacute;nitenciers, nos r & eacute;sultats sugg & egrave;rent que, bien que la conception architecturale des prisons implique une attention prioritaire & agrave; la s & eacute;curit & eacute;, il existe des moyens d'am & eacute;liorer l'organisation de l'espace, reconnaissant qu'un milieu de travail et un lieu de vie inconfortables constituent une menace potentielle au bien-& ecirc;tre et & agrave; la s & eacute;curit & eacute; des agents correctionnels et des personnes incarc & eacute;r & eacute;es.Correctional officers at HMP believe poor working conditions within the prison in part are affected by the physical design of the prison. Safety for both officers and prisoners is at risk due to infrastructure, technology, and air quality issues within the prison. Carceral space, particularly the physical design of a prison, should contribute to the well-being of all its occupants, prisoner or staff.

TI  - Zero Matching Records Found: Enforced Disappearance in the Carceral Web Landscape
T2  - SOCIOLOGY LENS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officially launched its online locator system, an internet-based public tool designed to assist attorneys, family members, and interested entities in locating detained individuals in ICE custody. In November 2019, Freedom For Immigrants (FFI), an immigrant rights organization, conducted surveys of individuals and organizations attempting to locate detainees and found 698 instances of migrants disappearing from the online locator system, with the search stating "zero matching records." With this in mind, this essay explores technologies of invisibility of the carceral web through ethnographic observation and testimonies collected in immigration detention. I use the term "carceral web" by Susila Gurusami to refer to the spatial intersection between carceral institutions and digital technologies that unveil the entanglements and workings of the carceral edgelands. I argue that the ICE locator system, a public tool for migrant identification and placement, not only showcases state-enforced disappearance but reveals a process of invisibilization and structural violence temporally and spatially at work.

TI  - In the Slammer Acoustemologies of the Carceral in the Prisons of Classical Hollywood
T2  - MUSIC SOUND AND THE MOVING IMAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that classical Hollywood prison films narrativise sound towards counter-carceral ends. Building on sound's uniquely fluid relationship to the penitentiary's hard spatial boundaries, it finds that prison films of the classical Hollywood era are full of inmate characters who deploy sound strategies and sound technologies to protest, oppose, or escape from carceral systems.Structured around case studies of Riot in Cell Block 11 (1954) and Caged! (1950), films in which sound plays a critical narrative function, the article develops the work of film and media scholars who have emphasised film sound's ability to draw the spectator into a phenomenological/affectual relationship with imprisoned characters. However, by shifting focus from affect and experience to narrative and resistance, this investigation also engages current developments in the study of prison sound in theoretical criminology and carceral abolitionist scholarship. This literature encourages a pursuit of how prison films may depict convicts enacting 'counter-carceral acoustemologies'. This leads the article to posit that sound is not only an avenue for audiences to experience the acoustics of imprisonment but a narrative and political tool that can be used by prisoners (real or fictional) against imprisonment.

TI  - Prison media mobilization: smuggled technologies and media practices in Lebanese carceral spaces
T2  - COMMUNICATION CULTURE & CRITIQUE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article explores the use of smuggled digital technologies by prisoners in Lebanese carceral spaces. Since 2012, prisoners have smuggled cellphones to document and share their experiences and protests, despite efforts by authorities to restrict this access. The study adopts Mart & iacute;n-Barbero's mediaciones and Mattoni's activist media practices, to propose "prison media mobilization"-the strategic and illicit reconfiguration of digital technologies by prisoners to subvert constraints and amplify dissent. The analysis focuses on four approaches: representation, production, circulation, and material practices. By examining recordings and contextual information from significant events in Lebanese prisons, the research shows how contraband digital technologies catalyze mobilizations. These technologies document, incite, propagate, and aid prisoners perform acts of defiance against prison conditions. The study highlights the complexity and innovation in prisoners' media practices, calling for a comprehensive framework to understand media mobilizations in carceral spaces.

TI  - A Primer on Carceral Health for Clinicians: Care Delivery, Regulatory Oversight, Legal and Ethical Considerations, and Clinician Responsibilities
T2  - MAYO CLINIC PROCEEDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, with approximately 1.7 million individuals detained in jails or federal or state prisons. Chronic medical conditions are more prevalent among adults in custody than among their nonincarcerated counterparts, resulting in needs that often surpass the on-site medical treatment capabilities of carceral facilities. For this reason, many community-based health care professionals will encounter incarcerated patients in an ambulatory or inpatient setting. Yet, although carceral status engenders pragmatic and ethical complexities in patient care, health care professionals in academic and community settings receive little or no education about correctional health. This special article seeks to address this knowledge gap by providing demographic and patient characteristics of this population, describing health care delivery in the criminal legal system, summarizing incarcerated patients' health care rights, conveying the current state of oversight and regulation for correctional health care, and presenting the role of health care professionals in advocating for the ethical care of incarcerated patients. By equipping themselves with this knowledge, clinicians may provide holistic and ethical care for persons involved in the criminal legal system.

TI  - Carceral Migrations: Reframing Race, Space, and Punishment
T2  - SOCIAL SERVICE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - We theorize state governance through population spatial trajectories to capture how seemingly disparate systems of punishment employ the same set of punishment logics and technologies to spatially regulate populations of color, which produces and reifies racial projects. Advancing a theoretical framework called carceral migrations, we argue that governments use legal punishment to force, restrict, and prevent movement as a racializing project of settler empire and anti-Blackness. Carceral migrations extend understandings of mass incarceration beyond confinement and holding by articulating three major points. First, the state's regulation of populations' spatial trajectories is punishment by design. Second, these spatially-oriented punishments operate as race-making and reinforcing technologies by producing punitive and recognizable spatial trajectories (or nontrajectories) for groups of people of color. Third, despite appearing race neutral in language, the development and application of legal codes and policies have disparate impacts on the spatial trajectories of people of color.

AB  - In this article, we focus on the agro-environmental dimensions of plantation agriculture in the U.S. South, examining the ways carceral relations constrain foodways through the interrelated control of human and non-human life, the racialized monopolization of land, and the production of hunger. Through a focus on the chemicalization of cotton plantation agriculture and the transformation of chicken to poultry, we show how the racialized control of life and labor has been extended temporally and spatially by means of agricultural technologies. In the decades following the abolition of slavery, white landowners enrolled legal structures of racialized coercion and agricultural technologies in the service of continued plantation production. Combining archival and ethnographic methods, we trace these dynamics in cotton and poultry production in the 20th century, we show how technologies putatively oriented toward agricultural "productivity" extended the carceral dynamics of prisons through agro-environmental racism, the control of land and labor, and the production of hunger. Cotton chemicals and poultry plant speedups, we argue, represent racial and spatial relations of material and ideological control and containment that displace nourishing and liberatory ways of living and relating.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR CRIME JUSTICE AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prisons are on the cusp of a technological transformation as twenty-first-century digital connectivity in 'free' society permeates prison design and offender management. This article will begin with an overview of the digital technologies in 'smart' prisons. Two limbs are emerging: technologies that are embedded into the infrastructure of prisons to benefit authorities through heightened security, and technologies that may benefit prisoners by providing them with positive opportunities to access justice, maintain family relationships and engage in programs aimed at optimising their post-release circumstances and rehabilitation. However, recent case law paints a picture of prison life devoid of human contact during the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing isolation and heightened anxiety. Through the lens of emergent conceptions of digital criminology, this article will analyse Australian case law to examine whether the automated, smart or digital prison offers a utopian vision of safe detention and rehabilitation or a dehumanised and punitive dystopia.

TI  - Carceral communication: Mass incarceration as communicative phenomenon
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces the concept of carceral communication to focus attention on the role of communication in mass incarceration's racialized, criminal justice process. To argue that a communication perspective helps explain how individuals, neighborhoods, and prisons are linked together, the article uses publicly available indictments that charged three New York City youth gangs with violent crimes. It identifies three facets of carceral communication to demonstrate how and why mass incarceration is a communicative phenomenon. First, computer-mediated communication (CMC) has become the most sought-after type of criminal evidence because of its visibility and permanence. Second, law enforcement uses the interpersonal communication and neighborhood networks of incarcerated Black men for crime control and surveillance purposes. Third, carceral communication operates as a communication feedback process, in which marginalized, young, Black men under surveillance know they are being watched and respond to that surveillance with resistance that is also subject to criminalization.

TI  - Paul Beatty's The Sellout as Allegory of the US Carceral System
T2  - ATLANTIS-JOURNAL OF THE SPANISH ASSOCIATION OF ANGLO-AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study looks into Paul Beatty's 2016 Man Booker Prize winning novel The Sellout (2015) as a powerful literary elaboration on the politics of racial identity. In naturalizing slavery and segregation in current U.S. society-the idea at the core of The Sellout-Beatty deploys racism along a continuum from the past to the present, rather than something in the past or a memory in the contemporary so-called post-racial world. The present analysis examines how the literary devices of parody and allegory assist in the creation of a satire, particularly of the U.S. carceral system. The fictional events at Dickens, as well as Bonbon Me's story, it is argued, are only the first layer of signification in a plot that allegorizes what is perhaps the most racialized criminal system in the world, one that several critics see as the most efficient apparatus of social control after Jim Crow. Through a second layer of meaning, the most controversial representations in the novel, namely slavery and segregation, are explored. The signs of parody in his use of hyperbole and stereotype, are also marks of a black post-blackness critique that registers Beatty's literary voice in the current debate on 'blackness' as identity.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on the treatment of opioid use disorder in carceral facilities: a cross-sectional study
T2  - HEALTH & JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare delivery everywhere, persons with carceral system involvement and opioid use disorder (OUD) were disproportionately impacted and vulnerable to severe COVID-associated illness. Carceral settings and community treatment programs (CTPs) rapidly developed protocols to sustain healthcare delivery while reducing risk of COVID-19 transmission. This survey study assessed changes to OUD treatment, telemedicine use, and re-entry support services among carceral and CTPs participating in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded study, Long-Acting Buprenorphine vs. Naltrexone Opioid Treatments in Criminal Justice System-Involved Adults (EXIT-CJS) study. In December 2020, carceral sites (n = 6; median pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 3468 people) and CTPs (n = 7; median pre-COVID 2020 monthly census = 550 patients) participating in EXIT-CJS completed a cross-sectional web-based survey. The survey assessed changes pre- (January-March 2020) and post- (April-September 2020) COVID-19 in OUD treatment, telemedicine use, re-entry supports and referral practices. Compared to January-March 2020, half of carceral sites (n = 3) increased the total number of persons initiating medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) from April-September 2020, while a third (n = 2) decreased the number of persons initiated. Most CTPs (n = 4) reported a decrease in the number of new admissions from April-September 2020, with two programs stopping or pausing MOUD programs due to COVID-19. All carceral sites with pre-COVID telemedicine use (n = 5) increased or maintained telemedicine use, and all CTPs providing MOUD (n = 6) increased telemedicine use. While expansion of telemedicine services supported MOUD service delivery, the majority of sites experienced challenges providing community support post-release, including referrals to housing, employment, and transportation services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this small sample of carceral and CTP sites innovated to continue delivery of treatment for OUD. Expansion of telemedicine services was critical to support MOUD service delivery. Despite these innovations, sites experienced challenges providing reintegration supports for persons in the community. Pre-COVID strategies for identifying and engaging individuals while incarcerated may be less effective since the pandemic. In addition to expanding research on the most effective telemedicine practices for carceral settings, research exploring strategies to expand housing and employment support during reintegration are critical.

AB  - Refugee camps are among the most prevalent institutional responses to global displacement. Despite a quasi consensus among scholars, activists, and humanitarians that camps are undesirable, and should only ever be temporary, little work has charted the political project and practices of camp abolition that challenge their spatial unfreedom. Rather than life-supporting spatial technologies of care that unwittingly signal political failures of inclusion, camps form part of a calculated system of "carceral humanitarianism". This article draws on experiences from Kenya where aid interventions have shaped politics, social dynamics and economic life since the 1990s. Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement serve as empirical windows to explore the limits of institutional decampment and reform policies, while demonstrating that more radical, abolitionist struggles are enacted through everyday mobilisation and acts of fugitivity among refugees themselves. Advancing critical studies of humanitarianism and forced migration, this article contends that only abolishing camps and their carceral logics helps to build more viable, safe, and humane futures for people on the move.

TI  - Don't Count on Us Dying: Carceral Accuracy and Trans-of-Color Life Beyond Hate Crimes
T2  - QED-A JOURNAL IN GLBTQ WORLDMAKING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the phenomenon of "carceral accuracy" in order to index how minoritarian participation into state antiviolence measures continues to reproduce and prioritize social scientific, criminological, and quantitative data-driven efforts to rationalize crime and punishment as a necessity for disrupting bias-motivated violence. In Los Angeles from 2014 to 2015, in the span of just five months the premature and violent deaths of three transgender women of color would exacerbate longstanding political rifts in the trans and queer community. These rifts formed along the lines of either divestment or reinvestment in criminal policy and legislation via a call for prosecution of "anti-trans hate crimes." Considering that over the last four decades Los Angeles has been lauded for its progressive LGBT policies and inclusive policing reforms, this article traces how trans and queer community safety agendas have become so easily conflated with policing and imprisonment technologies that presume to speculate, track, manage, and inoculate social risk. Focusing on examples such as former LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) Chief Charlie Beck's 2012 LGBT Police Forum proclamation of a "transgender progressive paramilitarism" to the LAPD's 2015 "Transgender Walk of Remembrance," these instances of "trans inclusive" pro-policing efforts demonstrate how antiviolence coalitions remain tied to carceral outcomes by way of routinized and compulsory participation in criminological discourse and technologies cloaked in the rhetoric of public safety. In conclusion, this article asks how carceral coalitions are maintained through law enforcement agencies' control of select community partnerships that prioritize how we count crime and who is represented in crime data. Carceral accuracy thus wrestles with the shared cultural preoccupation with upholding a mythos that "cold calculations," such as the counting of trans deaths, can provide any relief or disruption to anti-trans violence. In the end, what remains unshakeable in the wake of such violence is a heteropatriarchal and white supremacist possessive investment in improving criminal data.

T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In May 2019, 75 distressed migrants fleeing Libya were rescued by the merchant vessel Maridive 601 in the central Mediterranean Sea. With Italy, Malta, and Tunisia denying permission to disembark, the merchant vessel turned from a floating refuge into an offshore carceral space, leaving the migrants stranded near the Tunisian coast for 19 days. This article traces the migratory trajectories of the Maridive 75, as I will collectively refer to them, in order to show how EUrope's desire to deter, capture, and contain migrant mobilities has transformed the Mediterranean Sea into a carceral seascape. While offshore carcerality is not specific to EUrope's southern maritime border and also not a novel phenomenon, increasingly restrictive migration policies have dramatically reshaped the Mediterranean borderzone over recent years, multiplying infrastructures, technologies, and spaces of confinement. Interrogating the Mediterranean Sea as a carceral space generates insights into an ever-growing panoply of carceral but mobile forms of governance seeking to discipline and police unauthorised and precarious human movements, both at sea and on land. At the same time, as this article demonstrates, unruly migrant mobilities and struggles at sea continue to expose the often-conflictual processes at work in the production of the Mediterranean carceral seascape.

TI  - Biopower of Colonialism in Carceral Contexts: Implications for Aboriginal Deaths in Custody
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOETHICAL INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues that criminal justice and health institutions under settler colonialism collude to create and sustain "truths" about First Nations lives that often render them as "bare life," to use the term of Giorgio Agamben (1998). First Nations peoples' existence is stripped to its sheer biological fact of life and their humanity denied rights and dignity. First Nations people remain in a "state of exception" to the legal order and its standards of care (Agamben 1998). Zones of exception place First Nations people in a separate and diminished legal order. Medical and health agencies have been instrumental in shaping colonial "biopower," both in and beyond carceral settings to ensure that First Nations lives are managed in accordance with the colonial settler state project. This project is able both to threaten First Nations rights to live and to maintain settler self-perceptions of decency and care. We illustrate this discussion with reference to the tragic and unnecessary deaths in custody of twenty-two-year-old Yamatji woman Ms Dhu in 2014 in South Hedland Police Station, Western Australia, and twenty-six-year-old Dunghutti man David Dungay Jnr in Long Bay jail in Sydney, NSW, in 2015. Health professionals and police demonstrated callous disregard to Ms Dhu and Mr Dungay-treating them as "bare life."

AB  - This review considers a range of literature that contributes to a critical conversation encompassing radical opposition to the Carceral State and its logics, practices, and technologies. The carceral concept has been adopted and applied to multiple areas of the social world. With few exceptions, the term "Carceral State" has been used by many scholars without a comprehensive or agreed definition of the concept. This review is an attempt to piece together various pieces of literature that offer theoretical explorations of mass incarceration, as well as, how punishment and the logics of prison have informed economic, political, and social landscapes, compromising what has been identified by many scholars as a Carceral State.

TI  - Carceral churn: A sensorial ethnography of the bail and remand court
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses findings from an ethnographic study of a bail and remand court in Victoria, Australia. Through a focus on the sensory dimensions of forced movements within and through the bail court, the article contributes to the burgeoning sub-field of sensory criminology and develops the concept of 'carceral churn'. The article argues that the bail court's churn reproduces criminal and carceral subjects and is implicated in a project of carceral buildup. The churn of the bail court involves forms of mobility and exchange via the inter- and intra-carceral spaces that variously dull, distort, deprive or assault the senses with oppressive effects. This includes both 'new' and 'old' penal technologies such as holding cells, the custody dock, AV links and court-prison transport. The analysis of sensory violence challenges the notion that court 'efficiency' can improve justice experiences and outcomes and instead calls for increased attention to the harms and lethality that flow from carceral churn left un-checked.

TI  - The Carceral Web we weave: Carceral citizens' experiences of digital punishment and solidarity
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article asks: How do formerly incarcerated people navigate digital technologies? Using the metaphor of a spider web, I use 18 months of ethnographic observations of formerly incarcerated women of color to argue that formerly incarcerated people must contend with what I call-Carceral Web-the spatial intersection between carceral institutions and digital technologies. I identify two primary features of the Carceral Web: stickiness and entanglements. I characterize stickiness as the Internet's ability to make carceral histories inescapable across time and physical space, making it impossible for formerly incarcerated people to shed their criminal histories. I characterize entanglements as the intersections of institutional carceral relationships that result from practices and norms of digital connectivity. I argue that the pervasive significance of digital connectivity to everyday life compels formerly incarcerated people to contend with the Carceral Web, but stickiness and entanglements make them susceptible to exploitation and reincarceration. I call the Carceral Web's production of vulnerable subjects predation, which I characterize as a type of hidden sentence. I contend that despite having limited resources to navigate predation, formerly incarcerated people are tasked with co-opting the Carceral Web to build solidarity and training as a self-defense survival mechanism. Understanding the Spider of the Carceral Web as the convergence of corporations and state interests allows us to see how it feeds on the lives of formerly incarcerated people by consuming their marginalization and exclusion in the interests of racialized and gendered profit.

T2  - HEALTH & JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Correctional systems in several U.S. states have entered into partnerships with Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) to provide healthcare for people who are incarcerated. This project was initiated to better understand medical trainee perspectives on training and providing healthcare services to prison populations at one AMC specializing in the care of incarcerated patients: The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB). We set out to characterize the attitudes and perceptions of medical trainees from the start of their training until the final year of Internal Medicine residency. Our goal was to analyze medical trainee perspectives on caring for incarcerated patients and to determine what specialized education and training is needed, if any, for the provision of ethical and appropriate healthcare to incarcerated patients. Results We found that medical trainees grapple with being beneficiaries of a state and institutional power structure that exploits the neglected health of incarcerated patients for the benefit of medical education and research. The benefits include the training opportunities afforded by the advanced pathologies suffered by persons who are incarcerated, an institutional culture that generally allowed students more freedom to practice their skills on incarcerated patients as compared to free-world patients, and an easy compliance of incarcerated patients likely conditioned by their neglect. Most trainees failed to recognize the extreme power differential between provider and patient that facilitates such freedom. Conclusions Using a critical prison studies/Foucauldian theoretical framework, we identified how the provision/withholding of healthcare to and from persons who are incarcerated plays a major role in disciplining incarcerated bodies into becoming compliant medical patients and research subjects, complacent with and even grateful for delayed care, delivered sometimes below the standard best practices. Specialized vulnerable-population training is sorely needed for both medical trainees and attending physicians in order to not further contribute to this exploitation of incarcerated patients.

T2  - FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Policing and incarceration are feminist issues that stand to be interrogated through examinations of carceral practices. This essay positions the management and withholding of information and the observation of communications as instances of carceral specific practices that shape possibilities for incarcerated people and their communities. The author draws from their experience as a librarian in carceral facilities to outline how State-enacted violence occurs through the regulation and management of information access. As carceral facilities utilize third-party ICT providers, it is difficult to ascertain what information is or is not available. The introduction of new and evolving ICTs has led to increased opportunities for the State to monitor people who are incarcerated and their communities, positioning incarcerated people and their networks not only as sources of information but as data to train technologies of policing and surveillance. Instances of resistance to these practices reveal some ways that people who are not incarcerated can act in solidarity with people who are incarcerated and people who are subject to State surveillance.

AB  - Australia's offshore immigration detention centers are characterized by a culture of secrecy that keeps human rights abuses hidden. Yet, detainees are employing new technologies and media to narrate their experiences of incarceration. This article examines the potentials and limitations of bearing witness and exercising acoustic agency through podcasting. It provides a case study of The Messenger podcast in which a refugee detained on Manus Island exchanges voice messages with an Australian journalist. It finds that podcasting can breach the secrecy that sustains a punitive detention regime and evoke empathy in listeners through the affective nature of voice. However, podcasting is limited by the sense of distance produced by prerecorded and edited sound and by the risk of creating echo chambers through the selective nature of podcast consumption. Finally, we adapt, develop, and argue for the concept of earwitnessing as a practice of responsible and political listening to injustice.

TI  - The Carceral West Introduction
T2  - PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - This article is the guest editor's introduction to a special issue of Pacific Historical Review titled "The Carceral West." Whereas scholarship on the carceral state has traditionally focused on the U.S. South, the urban North, and post-war Los Angeles, scholars have more recently begun to focus on the long history of incarceration throughout the U.S. West. The West provides a rich environment for examining the carceral state, especially as it relates to race and immigration. Additional articles in this special issue include Elliott Young on immigrant incarceration at McNeil Federal Penitentiary between 1880 and 1930, Benjamin Madley interpreting the Spanish Mission system as a carceral regime, and Mary Mendoza examining the U.S.-Mexico border fence as a carceral environment that locks undocumented immigrants both in and out.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Bureaucracy, the governing legacy of the expanse of European colonialism, has come to be the dominating means by which states relate to their citizens; also through which they relate to other states. Analysing geographies of evil from within a post-colonial world system perspective, it becomes possible to see the creation of carceral geographies - literal prison states - created to control and manage populations inconvenient to or unwanted by the state. Deemed always already criminal, the unwanted are submitted to the technologies of control that have come to be associated most closely with the prison - with checkpoints, with constant suspicion that they are planning some malevolent behaviour, forbidden from entering certain areas of the state, forced to prove their own innocence in the face of presumed guilt, and often literally caged in by geographies designed to recreate the architecture of the prison. I contend that such systems are capable of being upheld through the banality of bureaucracy. The purpose of this piece is to first attempt a deconstruction of the notion of a banal bureaucracy and its role in the creation and maintenance of carceral geographies, and second to add to the growing literature on anthropology of the state through incorporated comparisons between individual carceral circumstances and a wider capitalist pattern of power.

TI  - Visual criminology and carceral studies: Counter-images in the carceral age
T2  - THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass incarceration maps onto global neoliberal carceral formations that, in turn, look very much like a visual iconography of social suffering. Camp or prison-like conditions define the daily life of many of the world's inhabitants caught in contexts of detention, incarceration, forced migration, and population displacement. Often depicted as abject subjects, actors in carceral contexts and the people who organize with them seek to find strategies of representation that humanize and politicize their existence. This essay attempts to gain a sense of the visual struggles at the heart of these carceral scenes by way of an analysis of the use of images and new media by current and former prisoners, community members, artists, and scholars to counter mass incarceration in the United States. Such scenes are significant sites for examining how a visual criminology might reveal and participate in the contestations and interventions that increasingly challenge the project of mass incarceration.

TI  - Technology, Sexual Violence, and Power-Evasive Politics: Mapping the Anti-violence Sociotechnical Imaginary
T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent discussions on technology and gender-violence prevention emphasize that technoscientific applications often advance pro-punishment logics that enact gendered inequalities. Less attention has focused on racialized dimensions and how technology might advance abolitionist and transformative justice agendas. In response, this article considers how inventors mobilize technology as a frontline response to sexual violence, in which technoscience-rather than police-enables individuals, friends, and family to provide safety and mutual aid. Through analysis of seven popular technologies produced between 2010 and 2020, this paper documents how their "abolitionist sensibility" is accompanied by fellow-traveler discourses that are unattuned to intersecting power relations. Findings suggest that while this sociotechnical imaginary is reacting to state power, it reinforces a race-neutral and techno-optimistic vision for building a violence-free future. These power-evasive politics may thus signal increased susceptibility to carceral creep and coercive surveillant regimes. After discussing these double-edge politics, I conclude by discussing power formations that are left unexamined in the imaginary and how to cultivate a counter-carceral praxis in line with transformative justice goals.

TI  - Digital vulnerability: People-in-prison, videoconferencing and the digital criminal justice system
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic forced prisons into extended lockdowns, people-in-prison have been increasingly reliant on remote access technologies such as videoconferencing to interact with the outside world from their carceral context. During the pandemic, both corrective services and criminal courts found that these communication technologies could adequately facilitate court appearances, legal conferencing, health services and visitations. Now, despite the lessening panic regarding COVID-19, there are suggestions that authorities are keen to continue, if not increase, the usage of videolinks meaning that people-in-prison will experience decreasing human contact. The argument is that COVID-19 "successes" are being used as an excuse to cement remote hearings and visits. This points to a future of absolute confinement uninterrupted by "inconvenient" physical court attendance or human visitors. This article will focus on the "digital vulnerability" of people-in-prison, that is, the intersection between the vulnerabilities of incarcerated people with the use of remote communication technologies such as videoconferencing or videolinks, and the digital inequalities that may be provoked or solved. The article will draw on qualitative research - fieldwork interviews with judicial officers, lawyers and associated criminal justice professionals - that reveal critical perspectives on the impacts of digital transformation on vulnerable people-in-prison. For instance, when asked about the vulnerabilities of people-in-prison, one defence lawyer (DL1) expressed the view that "no one cares about defendants" or their vulnerabilities, nor their abilities to engage with videolinks, comprehend or play any role in their own remote legal matters. We analyse our source materials through a framework of vulnerability theory and the developing concept of digital vulnerability. In this way, we seek to offer new knowledge regarding prison digital transformation, specifically the relationship between digital technologies in correctional environments and the vulnerable incarcerated population.

T2  - LAW & SOCIAL INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Why is the police role so broad in the United States today? Carceral state scholars have investigated how and why policymakers have treated so many social problems as policing problems, but they have not yet recognized the degree to which the call-for-service system has marginalized political control over police strategy. This Article traces the historical sources of this arrangement through extensive archival research into its evolution. We find that over the course of the twentieth century, the rise of new communications technologies gradually shifted the power to decide which problems are proper subjects of police attention to private individuals, eventually channeling their demands through centralized call centers that had been stripped of the authority and contextual knowledge needed to govern them in a meaningful way. That process fundamentally altered the character of public oversight over policing, elevating a distinctive set of individual interests as largely unchallenged determinants of the kinds of situations that are policeable. By illustrating how sociotechnical change unintentionally reallocated the authority to define the scope of an important institution's mandate, this case sheds new light on the factors that shape the police role and the role the public plays in defining it.

TI  - Carceralities and Approved Gender Violence: The Case of Direct Provision in Ireland
T2  - SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we argue that Direct Provision in Ireland is a state approved form of gendered carcerality which creates and exacerbates conditions of gendered violence. Direct Provision is a system of processing asylum seekers in Ireland where they are temporarily provided accommodation while they wait for a decision on their refugee status claim. This article shows how carceral practices are layered and gendered, making some spaces and bodies more carceral than others. These carceralities increase the institutional burden which agglomerates in human bodies and makes the lives of an already precarious population unliveable. Through a review of the strategies adopted by the government in relation to migrants, undocumented workers and asylum seekers, this article shows how the gendered experiences of certain asylum seekers like mothers and sexual violence survivors become the political site where state approved carceral practices and gendered violence merge.

TI  - eHealth-Enhanced Peer Navigation for Substance Use Treatment and HIV Prevention Service Linkage for Young Adults Surveilled by the Criminal Legal System: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Trial Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the United States, the proportion of criminal legal-involved (CLI) adults with a substance use disorder reaches 72%, and similar to 150,000 persons with HIV pass through a carceral setting annually, which represents 16% of the HIV-infected population nationally. Despite the high need for substance use treatment and HIV prevention services, few carceral settings successfully link CLI individuals to treatment upon release. Young adults represent 41.9% of the adults incarcerated in the United States and have the highest HIV incidence rates nationally. Peer patient navigation has successfully increased community-based care linkage for people living with HIV leaving jail; yet, peer-led navigation for HIV prevention among HIV-negative CLI populations is undeveloped and untested. eHealth approaches to substance use and HIV prevention services hold promise because they improve access to effective intervention services, particularly for younger people.Objective: This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to improve linkage to substance use treatment and HIV prevention services using peer navigation and a codeveloped eHealth technology adjunct.Methods: The three aims of this study are to (1) adapt an existing evidence-based navigator model and incorporate codeveloped eHealth technology to refer and link young adults (18 to 29 years) surveilled by the criminal legal system to substance use and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) services; (2) refine and test the intervention with criminal legal-involved young adults (CLI-YAs); and (3) assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of the intervention. Data to inform the intervention will be collected via system partner interviews (n=4) and focus groups with CLI-YAs (n=24). Next, an open trial (n=10) will be conducted. The intervention will be refined via interviews with participants and facilitators, and a randomized pilot trial (n=75) will be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the eHealth-enhanced navigation on substance use and PrEP services linkage. Exit interviews conducted with a subsample of intervention participants (n=10), the navigator (n=1), and system partners (n=4) will assess intervention acceptability and suggestions for improvement. A community of practice, a group of system partners with an interest in working toward solutions to common problems, will inform each phase of the study.Results: The project is currently ongoing. The project was funded in September 2022. Internal review board approval was received on March 21, 2022. The first results from early study aims are expected to be published in 2025.Conclusions: This study provides an opportunity to reduce HIV acquisition and improve access to substance use treatment in a systemically marginalized group: young CLI-YAs. The results will contribute to the development and testing of a future multilevel randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Enhancing healthcare accessibility through telehealth for justice impacted individuals
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Telehealth is a great tool that makes accessing healthcare easier for those incarcerated and can help with reentry into the the community. Justice impacted individuals face many hardships including adverse health outcomes which can be mitigated through access to telehealth services and providers. During the federally recognized COVID-19 pandemic the need for accessible healthcare was exacerbated and telehealth use surged. While access to telehealth should be considered a necessity, there are many challenges and barriers for justice impacted individuals to be able to utilize this service. This perspective examines aspects of accessibility, pandemic, policy, digital tools, and ethical and social considerations of telehealth in correctional facilities. Carceral facilities should continue to innovate and invest in telehealth to revolutionize healthcare delivery, and improve health outcomes for justice impacted individuals.

TI  - Evaluating public health vending machine rollout and utilization in criminal-legal settings
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE & ADDICTION TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Harm reduction resources for people who are involved in the criminal-legal system should be easily accessible. The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) used funding from a state opioid stewardship fund created through the Rhode Island Opioid Stewardship Act (legislation passed in 2019) to implement five custom-designed vending machines for community corrections offices and state awaiting trial carceral facilities. The vending machines provide resources for overdose prevention, infection prevention, basic needs, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We aim to describe the development and rollout of the vending machines and present data about items taken most frequently by setting. Methods: Research and design experts, with DOC and community stakeholders, developed and tailored the public-facing design of the vending machines. Before implementation, the researchers from the development team conducted meetings with staff at each location to discuss harm reduction and their role in addressing the opioid crisis in this high-risk population. The machines were manufactured in 2022 and installed in early 2023 (dates varied by location). The community support and advocacy organization tracks and maintains inventory (items taken and replaced) by month. No individual-level client data is collected. Results: There were 3720 items dispensed from May 2022 to February 2024 across five locations. Overall, hygiene kits were the most frequently accessed item (28.3 %, n = 1051), followed by NRT (19.0 %, n = 706) and ponchos (16.6 %, n = 616). The fentanyl tests (n = 230), wound care kits (n = 248), resource guide (n = 253), naloxone (n = 221), and safer sex kits (n = 218) each made up between 5.9 % and 6.8 % of items accessed. The pregnancy test was the least accessed at 4.8 % (n = 177). There were statistically significant differences in the monthly number of items distributed by location for the basic needs items, excluding NRT, with 39 items per month at the three Probation/Parole locations compared to 21 per month for the two DOC facilities. Conclusions: The utilization patterns demonstrate the demand for basic supplies and support related to harm reduction. Monitoring and summarizing utilization ensures that the vending machines remain useful to the community and facilitates transparency and communication with stakeholders.

TI  - Biopolitics, Carcerality, and Capital in Foucault's Unfinished Account of the Racial State
T2  - CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF RACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Michel Foucault argued that a key modality of state racism is biopower, through which the life of populations is differentially supported, shaped, and neglected. However, Foucault's account of state racism is unfinished, because it fails to identify the modalities of power that persist when states withdraw life-supporting technologies from racialized populations, thereby committing "indirect murder." It develops Foucault's account of racism and the racial state by describing the carceral technologies that expand with the withdrawal ofbiopower. To do so, this article draws on Foucault's theorization of carcerality in Discipline and Punish. It argues that biopolitical withdrawal is doubled by a simultaneous carceral investment, such that the state's denial of life-supporting technologies occurs in tandem with the racially structured policing of the poor. Additionally, this article explains how Foucault's concept of the management of illegalisms identifies a key vehicle of racialization, and illuminates the utility of carceral systems to racial capitalism.

TI  - Tuberculosis treatment outcomes after transfer or release from incarceration: A retrospective cohort study from Brazil.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disproportionately affects people deprived of liberty. Prior studies have shown higher TB treatment completion rates among incarcerated individuals compared to the general population. However, little is known about how incarceration-related movements such as transfers between facilities or releases to the community affect TB treatment outcomes.Methods: We linked person-level incarceration data with TB notifications data from the Notifiable Disease Information System for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul between January 2006 and December 2018. We constructed a cohort of individuals newly diagnosed with drug-susceptible TB who initiated treatment while incarcerated. We compared treatment outcomes between individuals who remained in the same carceral facility and those who were transferred to other facilities or released from incarceration during treatment. We computed the covariate-adjusted relative risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes for individuals transferred or released during treatment.Results: We identified 1,274 individuals who initiated TB treatment while incarcerated. Of these individuals, 849 (66.6%) remained in the same carceral facility, 259 (20.3%) were transferred to other facilities, and 166 (13.0%) were released to the community during treatment. Among those who remained in the same carceral facility, 72.3% (614/849) were successfully treated within eight months following treatment initiation. In contrast, only 61.0% (158/259) of those who were transferred and 49.4% (82/166) of those who were released achieved TB treatment success within eight months. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.7) times as high for individuals transferred to other facilities and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3 to 2.0) times as high for individuals released from incarceration, compared to those who remained incarcerated in the same facility during treatment. For individuals released less than two months into treatment, the risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes was twice as high (adjusted relative risk [aRR]:2.1, 95% CI: 1.6 - 2.6).Conclusions: Transfers between facilities and releases from incarceration are common and may pose barriers to TB treatment completion. Strategies for ensuring continuity of care across carceral facilities and between prison and community health systems are urgently needed to improve TB outcomes for individuals impacted by incarceration.

T2  - STUDIES IN THE NOVEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay interrogates the carceral geography of the California Central Valley by examining Rachel Kushner's novel The Mars Room (2018), which unfolds the life and limiting circumstances of a woman serving two life sentences. With capitalism as the driving force and background of this novel, this article examines the problem of representation posed by the prison in American society. Does the novel allow for a sharper perception of the loss wrought by the carceral state? I argue that Kushner uses the novel form to represent the slow violence of incarceration, which is a biopolitical project of the United States.

M3  - Article
AB  - Women in prison experience a double digital divide, due to gendered discrimination and carceral isolation. We focus on a recent policy change in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, whereby digital devices were provided to incarcerated people. This policy change is considered in light of women's trauma histories and the importance of community and family connection. We respond to themes presented at the United Nations' Sixty-Seventh Session on the Commission of the Status of Women, specifically achieving equality and empowerment for all women and girls in the digital age. Incarcerated women must be prioritized when addressing the gendered digital divide.

TI  - Policing Venereal Disease at Fort Huachuca, 1941-1945
T2  - JOURNAL OF MILITARY HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the racialization of venereal disease during World War II at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, the installation with the largest number of African American troops, arguing that medical and law enforcement surveillance overlapped in venereal disease prevention efforts in ways unique to the post's location and racial demographics. It analyzes how military and civilian agencies attempted to limit venereal disease and how Black officers and enlisted men and women responded to and influenced these policies. The U.S. Army used statistics to construct venereal disease as a racially specific problem and developed venereal disease education efforts at the post. Gendered effects of venereal disease control policy included a proposal to quarantine civilian women within the post hospital. As the army tried to maintain racial, gender, and geographic boundaries, the biomedical and carceral technologies used to police venereal disease grew more similar.

TI  - Phylogeography and transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis spanning prisons and surrounding communities in Paraguay
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent rises in incident tuberculosis (TB) cases in Paraguay and the increasing concentration of TB within prisons highlight the urgency of targeting strategies to interrupt transmission and prevent new infections. However, whether specific cities or carceral institutions play a disproportionate role in transmission remains unknown. We conducted prospective genomic surveillance, sequencing 471 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex genomes, from inside and outside prisons in Paraguay's two largest urban areas, Asuncion and Ciudad del Este, from 2016 to 2021. We found genomic evidence of frequent recent transmission within prisons and transmission linkages spanning prisons and surrounding populations. We identified a signal of frequent M. tuberculosis spread between urban areas and marked recent population size expansion of the three largest genomic transmission clusters. Together, our findings highlight the urgency of strengthening TB control programs to reduce transmission risk within prisons in Paraguay, where incidence was 70 times that outside prisons in 2021.To role that carceral institutions play in Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission remains somewhat unknown. Authors perform a prospective genomic surveillance study, to assess transmission dynamics in prisons and surrounding communities in Paraguay.

TI  - Minding the Gap: Building Equitable, Accessible, and Sustainable Prison Education Programs in Pennsylvania
T2  - JOURNAL OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AID
M3  - Article
AB  - The reinstatement of Pell grant eligibility for incarcerated individuals marks a pivotal moment in the landscape of higher education in prison (HEP) programming in the United States. However, despite this promising development, financial barriers persist, hindering the growth and sustainability of HEP initiatives. This qualitative study delves into the challenges faced by faculty, staff, and administrators within Pennsylvania's colleges and universities as they establish and operate HEP programs amidst an evolving funding environment. Drawing on interviews with nine HEP administrators across the state, we explore obstacles they confront, ranging from the Pell grant funding gap to logistical hurdles such as access to educational materials and technology. Moreover, demographic disparities and security concerns emerge as significant factors impacting the relationship between HEP programs and the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (DOC). Our findings extend beyond financial constraints, revealing broader systemic barriers to equitable and accessible HEP programming. We provide potential policy solutions to address these multifaceted challenges and foster a more supportive institutional environment for post-secondary education in Pennsylvania's carceral system.

TI  - Relational practice in health, education, criminal justice, and social care: a scoping review
T2  - SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Establishing and maintaining relationships and ways of connecting and being with others is an important component of health and wellbeing. Harnessing the relational within caring, supportive, educational, or carceral settings as a systems response has been referred to as relational practice. Practitioners, people with lived experience, academics and policy makers, do not yet share a well-defined common understanding of relational practice. Consequently, there is potential for interdisciplinary and interagency miscommunication, as well as the risk of policy and practice being increasingly disconnected. Comprehensive reviews are needed to support the development of a coherent shared understanding of relational practice.Method This study uses a scoping review design providing a scope and synthesis of extant literature relating to relational practice focussing on organisational and systemic practice. The review aimed to map how relational practice is used, defined and understood across health, criminal justice, education and social work, noting any impacts and benefits reported. Searches were conducted on 8 bibliographic databases on 27 October 2021. English language articles were included that involve/discuss practice and/or intervention/s that prioritise interpersonal relationships in service provision, in both external (organisational contexts) and internal (how this is received by workers and service users) aspects.Results A total of 8010 relevant articles were identified, of which 158 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the synthesis. Most were opinion-based or theoretical argument papers (n = 61, 38.60%), with 6 (3.80%) critical or narrative reviews. A further 27 (17.09%) were categorised as case studies, focussing on explaining relational practice being used in an organisation or a specific intervention and its components, rather than conducting an evaluation or examination of the effectiveness of the service, with only 11 including any empirical data. Of the included empirical studies, 45 were qualitative, 6 were quantitative, and 9 mixed methods studies. There were differences in the use of terminology and definitions of relational practice within and across sectors.Conclusion Although there may be implicit knowledge of what relational practice is the research field lacks coherent and comprehensive models. Despite definitional ambiguities, a number of benefits are attributed to relational practices.

TI  - Estimates of Hepatitis C Seroprevalence and Viremia in State Prison Populations in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Prior studies demonstrate that eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States (US) heavily depends on treating incarcerated persons. Knowing the scope of the carceral HCV epidemic by state will help guide national elimination efforts.Methods. Between 2019 and 2023, all state prison systems received surveys requesting data on hepatitis C antibody and viremic prevalence. We supplemented survey information with publicly available HCV data to corroborate responses and fill in data gaps.Results. Weighting HCV prevalence by state prison population size, we estimate that 15.2% of the US prison population is HCV seropositive and 8.7% is viremic; 54.9% of seropositive persons have detectable RNA. Applying prevalence estimates to the total prison population at year-end 2021, 91 090 persons with HCV infection resided in a state prison.Conclusions. With updated and more complete HCV data from all 50 states, HCV prevalence in state prisons is nearly 9-fold higher than the US general population. The heterogeneity in HCV prevalence by state prison system may reflect variable exposure before arrest and/or differences in treatment availability during incarceration. Elimination of HCV in the country depends on addressing the carceral epidemic, and one of the first steps is understanding the size of the problem.

TI  - Nursing as total institution
T2  - NURSING PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare under the auspices of late-stage capitalism is a total institution that mortifies nurses and patients alike, demanding conformity, obedience, perfection. This capture, which resembles Deleuze's enclosure, entangles nurses in carceral systems and gives way to a postenclosure society, an institution without walls. These societies of control constitute another sort of total institution, more covert and insidious for their invisibility (Deleuze, 1992). While Delezue (1992) named physical technologies like electronic identification badges as key to understanding these societies of control, the political economy of late-stage capitalism functions as a total institution with no cohesive, centralized, connected material apparatus required. In this manuscript, we outline the ways in which the healthcare industrial complex demands nurse conformity and how that, in turn, operationalizes nurses in service to the institution. This foundation leads to the assertion that nursing must foster a radical imagination for itself, unbound by reality as it presently exists, in order that we might conjure more just, equitable futures for caregivers and care receivers alike. To tease out what a radical imagination might look like, we dwell in paradox: getting folks the care they need in capitalist healthcare systems; engaging nursing's deep history to inspire alternative understandings for the future of the discipline; and how nursing might divest from extractive institutional structures. This paper is a jumping-off place to interrogate the ways institutions telescope and where nursing fits into the arrangement.

TI  - Racial Justice in Psycholegal Research and Forensic Psychology Practice: Current Advances and a Framework for Future Progress
T2  - LAW AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Police killings of Black civilians have brought unprecedented attention to racial and ethnic discrimination in the criminal justice and legal systems. However, these topics have been underexamined in the field of law-psychology, both in research and forensic-clinical practice. We discuss how a racial justice framework can provide guidance for advancing psycholegal research and forensic-clinical practice related to race, ethnicity, culture, and their intersections. A racial justice framework centers the goal of increasing fair and responsive treatment and just outcomes for the most vulnerable populations involved with the criminal justice, legal, and carceral systems and ending existing disparities. We argue that the framework should include the use of transparent nonobjectivity, in which racial justice is an explicit and acknowledged goal of research and practice that exists alongside a commitment to open and rigorous science and evidence-based practice. We then use the racial justice framework as a backdrop for discussing the articles and broader themes that appear in the special issue, which include racial biases in policing, public views of the police and use of force, expanding research on racial bias in lay judgments, understanding disparities in sentencing and corrections, and improving forensic practice. Finally, we look to the future, discussing practices and perspectives that can facilitate a racial justice approach in psycholegal research and forensic-clinical practice. Our recommendations include engaging in reflexivity and addressing positionality; expanding research questions and methods, especially qualitative and community-based participatory action research; centering and engaging with communities of color; greater emphasis on intersectionality; shifting toward structural and adaptive interventions; and greater integration of work from other fields.

TI  - Where do incarcerated trans women prefer to be housed and why? Adding nuanced understandings to a complex debate through the voices of formerly incarcerated trans women in Australia and the United States
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSGENDER HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIncarcerated trans women experience significant victimization, mistreatment, barriers to gender-affirming care, and human rights violations, conferring high risk for trauma, psychological distress, self-harm, and suicide. Across the globe, most carceral settings are segregated by sex assigned at birth and governed by housing policies that restrict gender expression-elevating 'safety and security' above the housing preferences of incarcerated people.Aim/methodsDrawing upon the lived experiences of 24 formerly incarcerated trans women in Australia and the United States and employing Elizabeth Freeman's notion of chrononormativity, Rae Rosenberg's concept of heteronormative time, and Kadji Amin's use of queer temporality, this paper explores trans women's carceral housing preferences and contextual experiences, including how housing preferences challenge governing chrononormative and reformist carceral housing systems.FindingsParticipants freely discussed their perspectives regarding housing options which through thematic analysis generated four options for housing: 1) men's carceral settings; 2) women's carceral settings; 3) trans- and gay-specific housing blocks; and 4) being housed in protective custody or other settings. There appeared to be a relationship between the number of times the person had been incarcerated, the duration of their incarceration, and where they preferred to be housed.ConclusionsThis analysis contributes to richer understandings regarding trans women's experiences while incarcerated. This paper also informs the complexities and nuances surrounding housing preferences from the perspectives of trans women themselves and considers possible opportunities to enhance human rights, health and wellbeing when engaging in transformative approaches to incarceration.

TI  - Returning home during the pandemic: a thematic analysis describing experiences of people with substance use disorders released early from New Jersey prisons during COVID-19
T2  - HEALTH & JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & aimsThe COVID-19 pandemic created intersecting health risks for incarcerated people with a history of substance use disorder (SUD). To reduce exposure to COVID-19 in prison, several US states enacted decarceration legislation. New Jersey enacted the Public Health Emergency Credit Act (PHECA), granting early release to thousands of incarcerated persons meeting eligibility criteria. This study undertook to explore how large scale decarceration during the pandemic impacted the reentry process for released individuals with SUDs.MethodsTwenty seven participants involved in PHECA releases - 21 persons released from NJ carceral facilities with past/present SUDs (14 with opioid use disorder, 7 with other SUDs) and 6 reentry service providers acting as key informants - completed phone interviews on PHECA experiences from February-June 2021. Cross-case thematic analysis of transcripts identified common themes and divergent perspectives.ResultsRespondents described challenges consistent with long-documented reentry difficulties including housing and food insecurity, difficulty accessing community services, insufficient employment opportunities, and limited access to transportation. Challenges that were pertinent to mass release during a pandemic included limited access to communication technology and community providers and community providers exceeding enrollment capacity. Despite reentry difficulties, respondents identified many areas where prisons and reentry service providers adapted to meet novel challenges presented by mass decarceration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Facilitators made available by prison and reentry provider staff included providing released persons with cell phones, transportation assistance at transit hubs, prescription support for medications for opioid use disorder, and pre-release assistance with ID and benefits through NJ's Joint Comprehensive Assessment Plan.ConclusionsFormerly incarcerated people with SUDs experienced reentry challenges during PHECA releases similar to those that occur during ordinary circumstances. Despite barriers faced during typical releases and novel challenges unique to mass release during a pandemic, providers made adaptations to support released persons' successful reentry. Recommendations are made based on areas of need identified in interviews, including reentry service provision facilitating housing and food security, employment, medical services, technology fluency, and transportation. In anticipation of future large scale releases, providers will benefit from planning ahead and adapting to address temporary increases in resource demands.

TI  - Transnational Affective Circuitry: Public Information Campaigns, Affective Governmentality, and Border Enforcement
T2  - ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographers have been central to identifying and exploring the shifting spatialities of border enforcement and how different enforcement strategies alter the geography of state sovereignty. Migration-related public information campaigns (PICs) are one strategy that has received increasing attention from geographers and social scientists more broadly in recent years. Although existing research examines the sites and spaces where PICs are distributed, as well as the affective content of their messaging, little research has examined the development of campaigns and the transnational connections that enable their deployment. This article draws on work in the fields of carceral circuitry and transnational enforcement networks to expand our understanding of affective governmentality as a transnational strategy of border governance. Based on data collected as part of a large-scale comparative study of the use of PICs by the U.S. and Australian governments, we argue that this form of affective governmentality relies on transnational circuits through which people, money, and knowledge move to enable the development and circulation of affective messaging. In doing so, we develop the concept of transnational affective circuitry to refer to the often contingent, temporary relations and connections that enable PICs to operate as a form of transnational affective governmentality aimed at hindering unauthorized migration. Our analysis illustrates the transnational connections that enable increasingly expansive and creative forms of border enforcement to emerge while also expanding the scope of examinations of affective governmentality to attend to the relations that undergird and enable this form of transnational governance.

TI  - DISCIPLINARY PROJECTS AND CARCERAL SPREAD - FOUCAULDIAN THEORY AND CHINESE PRACTICE
T2  - ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper has a dual object: First, utilizing Foucault's definition of 'disciplinary power', the paper demonstrates the disciplinary nature of China's reform through labour (laogai) system. It is suggested that laogai is an extension, deepening and modification of certain nineteenth-century Western utilitarian penal themes designed to 'reform the criminal mind' and produce 'obedient subjects'. Second, having established the disciplinary nature of die laogai project the paper then goes on to examine the (neo-Foucauldian) 'disciplinary dispersal thesis'. This thesis suggests a gradual spread of carceral technologies which led to the formation of a disciplinary society. This paper suggests that there are a number of theoretical problems in this thesis, not the least of which is its rather ambiguous relationship to the work of Foucault.

TI  - Care as (re)capture: Data colonialism and race during times of crisis
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the role that data-driven technologies play in expanding and reasserting the legitimacy of the US racial state during times of crisis. Specifically, I examine how prison officials used a software called Verus to reinforce the perceived necessity of penal institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government officials used Verus to produce narratives that (1) recast criminalized communities as dangerous and therefore disposable and (2) shielded carceral institutions from liability for systematic neglect. Ultimately, the aim of this article is to contribute to emerging critical concepts such as "data colonialism," a term that has largely been used to describe the social and economic consequences of parasitic data extraction and monopoly control of digital infrastructure. In addition to these issues, I argue that data-driven technologies are used as vehicles for movement capture and the reproduction of prison logics that enable modes of racialized economic exploitation that extend far beyond the high-tech innovation economy.

TI  - Building an Integrated Data Infrastructure to Examine the Spectrum of Suicide Risk Factors in Philadelphia Medicaid
T2  - ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While there are many data-driven approaches to identifying individuals at risk of suicide, they tend to focus on clinical risk factors, such as previous psychiatric hospitalizations, and rarely include risk factors that occur in nonclinical settings, such as jails or emergency shelters. A better understanding of system-level encounters by individuals at risk of suicide could help inform suicide prevention efforts. In Philadelphia, we built a community-level data infrastructure that encompassed suicide death records, behavioral health claims, incarceration episodes, emergency housing episodes, and involuntary commitment petitions to examine a broader spectrum of suicide risk factors. Here, we describe the development of the data infrastructure, present key trends in suicide deaths in Philadelphia, and, for the Medicaid-eligible population, determine whether suicide decedents were more likely to interact with the behavioral health, carceral, and housing service systems compared to Medicaid-eligible Philadelphians who did not die by suicide. Between 2003 and 2018, there was an increase in the number of annual suicide deaths among Medicaid-eligible individuals, in part due to changes in Medicaid eligibility. There were disproportionately more suicide deaths among Black and Hispanic individuals who were Medicaid-eligible, who were younger on average, compared to suicide decedents who were never Medicaid-eligible. However, when we accounted for the racial and ethnic composition of the Medicaid population at large, we found that White individuals were four times as likely to die by suicide, while Asian, Black, Hispanic, and individuals of other races were less likely to die by suicide. Overall, 58% of individuals who were Medicaid-eligible and died by suicide had at least one Medicaid-funded behavioral health claim, 10% had at least one emergency housing episode, 25% had at least one incarceration episode, and 22% had at least one involuntary commitment. By developing a data infrastructure that can incorporate a broader spectrum of risk factors for suicide, we demonstrate how communities can harness administrative data to inform suicide prevention efforts. Our findings point to the need for suicide prevention in nonclinical settings such as jails and emergency shelters, and demonstrate important trends in suicide deaths in the Medicaid population.

While contemporary 'new' cultural criminology continues to be focused on the situated experience of deviant 'edgeworkers', this chapter argues cultural criminology's concern with the crime-media nexus provides particularly fertile ground for exploring insights provided by activists, academics, professional journalists and citizen journalists around informal interventions on formal criminal justice processes using social media and digital technologies. Drawing on examples from a burgeoning body of crime-media research, the chapter makes a case for 'cultural criminology activism', which, like activist criminology, is consciously disengaged from mainstream criminology's alignment with the neoliberal-carceral state and its reformist agenda.

TI  - Communication, carcerality, and neoliberal stigma: the case of hunger and food assistance in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on three strains of critical theory - Foucauldian biopolitics, critical race theory, and the work of sociologist Loic Wacquant - I argue that neoliberal stigma is foundational to the design of the food (assistance) system. Neoliberal stigma is constituted in the discursive practices of shame, suspicion, and surveillance, which are communicative and carceral technologies used to discipline poor and racialized communities in their efforts to manage hunger and poverty. These communicative technologies are rooted in anti-poor, racist, and carceral logics and are deployed against Black and Brown bodies negatively impacting health and social wellbeing. Drawing on the voices of people with lived experiences of hunger, I demonstrate the mundane and exceptional ways in which shame, suspicion, and surveillance emerge in discursive practices surrounding food assistance and how these practices enjoin food assistance and carcerality into a 'single organizational contraption.' The analysis ends with three broad interventions required to disrupt neoliberal stigma amid racist violence.

TI  - Automating gentrification: Landlord technologies and housing justice organizing in New York City homes
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on surveillance technologies that New York City landlords have been installing in low-income, public, and affordable tenant housing over the last decade. It looks at how new forms of biometric and facial recognition-based landlord technology automate gentrification and carcerality, reproducing racist systems of recognition and displacement. We offer these systems a genealogy and geography, looking at intersections of zoning, gentrification, eviction, and policing that have historically solidified to dispossess and incarcerate tenants of color. Additionally, this paper addresses how and why New York City has emerged as the world's epicenter of "landlord tech," mapping out several decades of urban datafication that have rendered low-income, nonwhite majority housing complexes as laboratories for surveillance experimentations today. We observe how processes of "catching" tenants for lease violations automate a longer history of racist surveillance and property-making. Yet we also highlight tenant-led resistance that has successfully thwarted facial recognition deployment and that continues to organize for landlord tech abolition today. Through affective organizing, grounded relationality, and alliance-building, tenants have created vital abolitionist space and knowledge to curb landlord technologies and the carceral logics they encode.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing for Environmental Data Justice: Perspectives from Anti-Prison Community Organizers on the Uses of Geospatial Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, journalists and researchers have used mixed methods to characterize a pattern of prison landscapes being exposed to environmental hazards such as air pollution, proximity to hazardous facilities, and inadequate mitigation in extreme weather-a pattern frequently referred to as "prison ecology." However, no studies have sought to characterize the perceptions of organizers across U.S. cities who work at the intersection of prison and the environment, and the potential or limitations of data to support ongoing activities. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with organizers that work on issues related to prison and the environment to understand the tactics and challenges in prison ecology organizing, and opportunities or limitations of geospatial data and technology development to support desired outcomes. Results indicate that prison ecology organizers regularly engage data and mapping to support their campaigns and challenge the state's control over information. However, activists reported that some data tools are overly burdensome, insufficient, or difficult to master. They also report a desire for new and accessible data and mapping tools since there are numerous gaps in knowledge about prisons and environmental concerns. Finally, activists articulated specific changes that they would like to see in the U.S. carceral system as a result of mobilizing around the use of key data sources. Our findings advance the study of the data practices of community organizers by providing insight into how different mediums of data and digital tools are currently integrated into activism. This article also offers constructive reflections into how datafication, and specifically remote sensing (RS) technology, can further be brought to bear on prison ecology. This work can be useful to any scholar-activists aiming to develop RS for prison ecology organizing or environmental justice more broadly.

TI  - An Evaluation of Opioid Use in Black Communities: A Rapid Review of the Literature
T2  - HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThere are multiple aspects of the opioid crisis among Black people, who have been left out of the broader conversation. Despite evidence of increased opioid overdose deaths, less is known about opioid use among Black people. This review synthesizes research on Black people who use opioids; the goals are to advance knowledge, highlight research gaps, and inform clinical practice. MethodsThis rapid review investigating opioid use among Black people utilized systematic review methods and was conducted according to a predefined protocol with clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO ID: 177071). A comprehensive search strategy was used, including published and gray-literature sources (i.e., literature that has not been formally published). A narrative summary of the results is presented. ResultsA total of 76 works were selected for inclusion and full text review. Sex, age, geographic location, and involvement in the carceral system were associated with the use of opioids among Black individuals. Non-epidemiologic factors included treatment-seeking patterns, disparate clinician prescribing, and social determinants. ConclusionsThrough this rapid review we suggest three main areas of focus: (1) including culturally informed collection methods in epidemiologic surveys to accurately reflect prevalences, (2) funding research that specifically addresses the importance of culture in accessing treatment, and (3) directly studying how social determinants can improve or exacerbate health outcomes. Focusing on the unique needs of Black people who use opioids is warranted to increase treatment initiation and adherence among a population less likely to engage with the traditional health care system.

TI  - No Justice, No Resilience: Prison Abolition As Disaster Mitigation in an Era of Climate Change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Disasters are becoming more frequent and destructive while the consequences for incarcerated persons have grown increasingly visible. Simultaneously, scholars, individuals, and communities are grappling with police brutality and systemic anti-Black racism in the criminal legal system by engaging with the concept of abolition. In this article we demonstrate that these issues are not disconnected and argue that the abolition of the prison industrial complex (PIC) would mitigate the impacts of disasters for incarcerated persons and their communities. Incarceration undermines individual and collective resilience needed to recover from disasters, whereas carceral infrastructure facilitates disaster harm to incarcerated persons and their communities. Incarceration itself mirrors the harm and destruction of a disaster. Abolition of the PIC would not only prevent harm from incarceration, but also systems of accountability put in place by communities as suggested by abolitionists would contribute to the resilience of individuals and communities. By examining these connections, we provide a framework for considerations of abolition in an era of reckoning with anti-Blackness, the violence of the criminal legal system, and climate change, and suggest further investment of research in these areas.

AB  - Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential-just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.

AB  - Since the implementation of the Young Offenders Act (YOA) in 1984, very little attention has been given to the state of the under 12'' offender. The following article analyzes preliminary data on offenders under 12 years of age, gathered from 27 contributing police forces across Canada. In addition to presenting assumed causes or contributors to the anti-social and offending behaviour of those between the ages of 7 and 11, the article critiques the province of Ontario for its lack of response to the current state of the young offender system. Because of the need for a radical reorientation of legislation and services for children, a comprehensive, ecological paradigm is proposed which, it is argued would reflect a more holistic, humane, and community-based approach, to the benefit of ''under twelves''.

TI  - Geographies of the camp
T2  - POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing the current growing global archipelago of encampments including concentration, detention, transit, identification, refugee, military and training camps, this article is a geographical reflection on 'the camp', as a modern institution and as a spatial bio-political technology. In particular, it is about the past and present camp geographies and the apparatus of dispositifs that make them an ever-present spatial formation in the management of custody and care characterizing many authoritarian regimes as well as many contemporary democracies. I especially focus on the works of Paul Gilroy, Giorgio Agamben and Reviel Netz to discuss camp spatialities, the normalization of camp geographies, and related biopolitics. In doing so, I advance the argument to resist on present-day proliferating manifestations of camp and 'camp thinking', calling for the incorporation of 'camp studies' into the broader field of political geography to considering the geographies of the camp as constitutive hubs of much broader, modern geopolitical economies.

T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic gunshot detection systems (AGDS) have been emerging as a technological solution to the growing problem of gun violence around the world. We examine a particularly prominent AGDS technology called RespondTM developed by publicly traded US company ShotSpotter Inc. (NASDAQ: SSTI) to better understand the sociotechnical logics that inform its operation. Drawing from frameworks provided by science and technology studies and sound studies, we ask, "What are the broader conditions that allow for a successful AGDS as it is imagined by ShotSpotter?" At a time in which the accuracy and reliability of ShotSpotter's AGDS are being seriously questioned through the numerous reports of false positives that reached as high as 99 percent in certain cities it was deployed in, it is imperative to interrogate what exactly is "false" in these false positive reports and how the company operates despite them. In this paper, we trace ShotSpotter and its artificial intelligence/machine learning AGDS technologies as they exist across various patents, promotional materials, financial documents, and public statements to not only better understand the ways in which they translate sound into "crime," or space into "crime scene," but also to bring attention to how ShotSpotter translates itself across its different audiences.

TI  - "We Got Witnesses" Black Women's Counter-Surveillance for Navigating Police Violence and Legal Estrangement
T2  - SOCIAL PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Police violence shapes the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, and while much has been written about strategic responses to police, missing is an examination of how black women navigate interactions with officers. Based on 32 interviews with black women, we find that they use witnessing, or the mobilization of others as observers to police encounters. Research demonstrates the rising role of videos and smartphones in documenting encounters with officers. We find that black women adapt witnessing techniques based on their surroundings, available resources, and network contacts. Three forms of witnessing are observed: physical witnessing, mobilizing others in close proximity to interactions with officers; virtual witnessing, using cellphone or social media technology to contact others or record interactions with officers; and institutional witnessing, leveraging police or other institutional contacts as interveners to interactions with officers. Black women mobilize witnessing to deescalate violence, gather evidence, and promote accountability. Attuned to both the interactional and structural dynamics of police encounters, black women conceptualize witnessing as a way to survive police encounters and navigate their legal estrangement within the carceral system. We theorize black women's witnessing as a form of resistance as they work to reconfigure short- and long-term power relations between themselves, their communities, and police.

TI  - Michel Foucault and the Problematics of Power: Theorizing DTCA and Medicalized Subjectivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores Foucault's two different notions of power: one where the subject is constituted by power-knowledge relations and another that emphasizes how power is a central feature of human action. By drawing out these two conceptualizations of power, Foucault's work contributes three critical points to the formation of medicalized subjectivities: (1) the issue of medicalization needs to be discussed both in terms of both specific practices and holistically (within the carceral archipelago); (2) we need to think how we as human beings are "disciplined" and "subjectivated" through medicalization, as discourses, practices, and institutions are all crystallizations of power relations; and (3) we need to reflect on how we can "resist" this process of subjectification, since "power comes from below" and patients shape themselves through "technologies of the self." Ultimately, Foucault's work does not merely assist us in refining our analysis; rather, it is essential for conceptualizing medicalization in contemporary society.

TI  - Electronic Monitoring Smartphone Apps: An Analysis of Risks from Technical, Human-Centered, and Legal Perspectives
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 31ST USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 31st USENIX Security Symposium
CL  - Boston, MA
AB  - Electronic monitoring is the use of technology to track individuals accused or convicted of a crime (or civil violation) as an "alternative to incarceration." Traditionally, this technology has been in the form of ankle monitors, but recently federal, state, and local entities around the U.S. are shifting to using smartphone applications for electronic monitoring. These applications (apps) purport to make the monitoring simpler and more convenient for both the community supervisor and the person being monitored. However, due to the multipurpose nature of smartphones in people's lives and the amount of sensitive information (e.g., sensor data) smartphones make available, this introduces new risks to people coerced to use these apps.To understand what type of privacy-related and other risks might be introduced to people who use these applications, we conducted a privacy-oriented analysis of 16 Android apps used for electronic monitoring. We analyzed the apps first technically, with static and (limited) dynamic analysis techniques. We also analyzed user reviews in the Google Play Store to understand the experiences of the people using these apps, and also the privacy policies. We found that apps contain numerous trackers, the permissions requested by them vary widely (with the most common one being location), and the reviews indicate that people find the apps invasive and frequently dysfunctional. We end the paper by encouraging mobile app marketplaces to reconsider their role in the future of electronic monitoring apps, and computer security and privacy researchers to consider their potential role in auditing carceral technologies. We hope that this work will lead to more transparency in this obfuscated ecosystem.

TI  - Biotechnologies and the future of opioid addiction treatments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The future of treatment ?including addiction treatment ?is biotechnological. Depot injections, agonist/antagonist implants, deep brain stimulation, and hapten conjugate vaccines are hailed by researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers as medicine?s best hope to minimize illicit use, to decrease risk of overdose and painful withdrawal, and to prevent diversion of medicines to illicit markets. Marketing and use of new technologies reveal old tensions framing concepts of addiction and its treatment: between medical condition and disorder of the will, between criminal justice and health, and between patient choice and system control. Using the examples of depot naltrexone and implantable and injectable buprenorphine in the U.S., this essay considers the arc of long-acting opioid treatment and implications for the future. These include the rise of Vivitrol courts and ?carceral prescription ??where criminal justice systems mandate medicine to lock up brain receptors much as they might lock up people themselves ?as well as use of buprenorphine formulations positioned as increasing both patient benefit and provider control. We also consider lessons from debates on long-acting contraceptive technologies such as Norplant and Depo-Provera. While multiple new long-acting formulations are under development, success will be determined less by characteristics of particular formulations and more by whether or not the new technologies are accompanied by a new ethics of addiction treatment that emphasizes therapeutic alliance, concordance over compliance, and a genuine commitment to allowing patients the ability to narrate and be believed in their descriptions of their treatment experiences.

TI  - Beyond the erotics of Orientalism: Lawfare, torture and the racial-sexual grammars of legitimate suffering
T2  - SECURITY DIALOGUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrary to commonsense understandings of torture as a form of information-gathering, confessions elicited through the use of torture produce notoriously unreliable data, and most interrogation experts oppose it as a result. With a focus on the US carceral regime in the War on Terror, this article explores the social relations and structures of feelings that make torture and other seemingly ineffective and absurd carceral practices possible and desirable as technologies of security. While much of international relations scholarship has focused on the ways in which affective and material economies of Orientalism are central to representations of the terrorist' threat, this article connects the carceral violences in the racialized lawfare against Muslimified people and spaces to the capture and enslavement of Africans and the concomitant production of the figure of the Black body as the site of enslaveability and openness to gratuitous violence. The article further explores how these carceral security practices are not simply rooted in racial-sexual logics of Blackness, but themselves constitute key sites and technologies of gendered and sexualized race-making in this era of post-racial triumph' (HoSang and LaBennett, 2012: 5).

TI  - All Robots Are Disabled
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF ROBOPHILOSOPHY - SOCIAL ROBOTS IN SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th Biennial Robophilosophy Conference on Social Robots in Social Institutions
CL  - Helsinki, FINLAND
AB  - All robots are disabled. I mean this in every possible sense. The anthropomorphic robot is always viewed through a deficit lens-a catalog of its failures to ascend from the uncanny valley. The assembly line robot is regarded with a precarious caution and skepticism-it is only noticed when it fails, becomes convalescent, a disruption to capitalist efficiency. Our relationship to robotic agents is constantly tensored by our desire that they transcend human limitations and our frustration that they remain inelegant and demand our vigilance and maintenance. Everywhere the robot is, the politics of disablement follow. Nowhere is this more evident than within the bodies of common cyborgs-disabled people whose ontology is mediated through the interface of organic matter and technology. Through case studies in human-robot relations (in the home, at work, and within the body), this piece explores how disability stigma informs our sociality with robotic agents and sustains exploitative social systems. I then deploy an alternative reading of these relations, informed by disabled cyborg scholarship and experiences, to propose cripped human-robot relations that prefigure liberation from the legacies of colonial, plantation, and carceral social relations.

TI  - Indefinite stuckness: Listening in a time of hyper-incarceration and border entrapment
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - New technologies for recording, reproducing, and disseminating sound are increasingly accessible and provide important opportunities for listening to accounts of confinement. Through a politics and practice of 'earwitnessing detention', this article explores experiential patterns and distinctions between immigration detention and imprisonment. By 'tuning in' to radio and podcasting emerging from and through carceral spaces, we argue that both detained asylum seekers and Aboriginal prisoners in Australia narrate an experience of 'indefinite stuckness'. Indefinite stuckness is an existential condition within a carceral continuum that is both spatial and temporal, and characterised by massive racial inequalities. For detained asylum seekers, indefinite stuckness manifests in the absence of a set release date, whereas for Aboriginal prisoners, it is a cycle of criminalisation and re-incarceration in the colony. This important distinction shapes how detention is represented: as torturous and abusive, or as an opportunity for respite from the 'chaos' outside. Linking these sometimes-divergent accounts of confinement are themes of friendship and community as forms of survival and resistance to the abjection that frequently accompanies indefinite stuckness.

TI  - Blueprint for interracial solidarity: C. L. R. James's Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways as prison writing
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trinidadian thinker and activist C. L. R. James penned a criticism of Herman Melville's work, Mariners, Renegades, and Castaways, while incarcerated in Ellis Island, New York, in the early 1950s. I investigate how the contradictory claims on labour and race, literary analysis, and communism in the last chapter come from what I call the prison-detention continuum: a historical continuity allocated to prison and detention facilities despite an overt difference between the two. The distinction survived so as to maintain racial classification and labour force from the times of slavery and plantation to the Cold War era. The physical statuses of those incarcerated were insecure when the McCarran-Walter Act legalized ideological surveillance and accelerated racism inside and outside the carceral spaces. In his book on Melville, James clarifies the difference between prison and detention by emphasizing labour's role in Ellis Island. He situates his personal experience of maltreatment of his ulcer as a structural issue, produced by the way the officers obey their authorities without any principle. To foreground the docile individuals in the totalitarian society, he compares the inmates and officers on Ellis Island with the shipmates of the Pequod in Moby Dick. Furthermore, he regards that if labour is racialized, it will necessarily culminate in revolt. I argue that James's reference to the Korean War POWs on Koje Island prefigures an interracial solidarity that becomes visible after the Bandung Conference of 1955.

AB  - This article provides a cultural history of film and television at Louisiana's Angola Prison in the 1950s to show that moving images coexisted with the brutalities for which the prison is known, including stark labor conditions, corporal violence, and punitive racism. Despite their promotion as improvements during an era of reform, the technologies of film and television accommodated the prison's repressive hierarchies of race, gender, and labor. By analyzing the penitentiary's newspaper, the Angolite, alongside its peer publications at other prisons, I show that prison newspapers played a significant role in promoting film exhibition in carceral spaces.

AB  - Using the ethical and legal concept of shared responsibility for healthy births, this article considers social, cultural, and historical contexts in which medicalization and criminalization have worked in tandem to widen surveillance in ways that intensify scrutiny of women's lives under the guise of child protection, bringing women who are pregnant, postpartum, or parenting under criminal justice control. Although pregnant and postpartum women are prime candidates for medication-assisted treatment (MAT), the expanding carceral system has not prioritized drug treatment or reproductive justice. This article investigates ethical and historical dimensions of the question, According to which principles and practices should screening and surveillance be carried out to reduce harm, safeguard civil and human rights-including reproductive autonomy-and ensure that treatment, when necessary, occurs in the least coercive settings possible?

Drawing attention to literatures within carceral geography and cybergeography, and presenting an empirical case study of the simulation computer game Prison Architect, it suggests that rather than being necessarily ephemeral, fleeting and transient, digital cultural production can also be carefully created, curated and manipulated in ways which involve both deep reflection on, and profound shaping of, political attitudes.

TI  - Governing the captives: Forensic psychiatric nursing in corrections
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN PSYCHIATRIC CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - TOPIC/PROBLEM: Since 1978, the federal inmates of Canada serving time have had access to a full range of psychiatric care within the carceral system. Five psychiatric units are part of the Federal Correctional Services. Nursing practice in forensic psychiatry opens up new horizons in nursing. This complex professional nursing practice involves the coupling of two contradictory socio-professional mandates: to punish and to provide care.METHOD: The purpose of this article is to present the results of a grounded theory doctoral study realized in a multi-level security psychiatric ward of the Canadian Federal Penitentiary System. The theoretical work of the late French philosopher, Michel Foucault, and those of sociologist, Erving Goffman, are used to illuminate the qualitative data that emerged from the author's fieldwork.FINDINGS: A Foucauldian perspective allows us to understand the way forensic psychiatric nursing is involved in the governance of mentally ill criminals through a vast array of power techniques (sovereign, disciplinary, and pastoral) which posited nurses as "subjects of power". These nurses are also "objects of power" in that nursing practice is constrained by formal and informal regulations of the penitentiary context.CONCLUSION: As an object of "governmental technologies", the nursing staff becomes the body onto which a process of conforming to the customs of the correctional milieu is dictated and inscribed. The results of this qualitative research, from a nursing perspective, are the first of their kind to be reported in Canada since the creation of the Regional Psychiatric Correctional Units in 1978.

AB  - The work of Michel Foucault is taken as inspiration for a study of the organizational field of asylums, prisons, orphanages, and other carceral organizations operating in New York City in 1888. Foucault argues that institutional power is organized into dually ordered system of truth and power. Using text data describing the clients and institutional technologies (organizational "power signatures") of 168 organizations, we apply structural equivalence methods to unpack speech activity, showing that as Foucault suggests, there may be dually ordered sub-domains of truth and power that help de. ne the underlying logic of this institutional field.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper seeks to examine how the imagination of the future of urban space as a result of technological development develops through SF fiction, and Hao Jingfang’s novel “Folding Beijing” as the target text. In the SF genre, urban space is one of the most important factors. The city is portrayed as the best embodied space for the cutting edge of science and technology covered by the SF genre and the new living conditions that humans face to face to face. Therefore, SF fiction presents a variety of imaginations in various ways about how the digital transformation of urban space we face today will unfold. This paper, among others, looks at what type of urban space Beijing’s dystopian future presents, described by Hao Jingfang’s novel “The Folding Beijing” which won the Hugo Prize in 2016.Beijing, the “Folding Beijing” drawn by Hao Jingfang, is divided into first, second and third spaces, each inhabited by upper, middle and lower classes, and these spaces do not coexist at the same time. When one space is spread out on the surface at a specified time, the rest of the space folds and disappears on the other side of the surface.This paper attempts to analyze the properties of Beijing as described in the “Folding Beijing” using the theories of urban scholars. And identify the folding city depicted in the work as a reflection of the various urban problems that Beijing now faces. Take a look at the dystopian prospects that will emerge when the various urban problems facing the current metropolises are combined with digital transitions that lean on the development of science and technology.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This essay takes issues with the panoptical condition of representation in 19th century European novels and paintings. By the panoptical condition, I am referring to the way in which images of solitude (solitary confinement, self-absorption, etc.) tend to organize a modern, ideologically constraining notion of selfhood, and in doing so, also implicate Jeremy Bentham’s theory of carceral technologies and moral discipline. My task in the essay is to challenge this type of representation by relating how it is often accompanied by a series of inconsistencies or conflicts in trying to tell a coherent story of solitude. I want to argue that such a difficulty signals a protean, slippery region of human perception that tends to refer to movements and nuances in human experience, which are too subtle or elusive to be detected by the panoptical frame of representation.Another purpose of the essay is to relate the meaning of these features in the urban context. For this urban outlook, I will historicize how the panoptical representation emerged in response to an increasing anxiety among the informed public about the modern city as the hotbed of moral levity. The idea of prison reform in the nineteenth century as the tool of moral rehabilitation was offered as an effective antidote to the city’s “relaxed morality”. In keeping with my anti-disciplinary approach, the essay aims to explore the problem of such a penal outlook by drawing on the city as the site of manifold, often unpredictable experiences that both complicates as well as facilitates the idea of prison reform.With such a view in mind, I will examine a selection of novels by Balzac and Dickens and paintings by William Frith, in which the figuration of solitary confinement merges with types of multiplicitynoises, pedestrians, crowds, vehicles, etc.that are brought on by the city. The intercrossing between isolation and communication produces unique moves such as perspectival shifts and figural variations, which are inconsistent with what the panoptical frame of representation purports to illustrate. In challenging boundaries and rules of panoptical discipline, these features draw on the urban multiplicity as the common thread of different interventions.

T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. People who are incarcerated are especially vulnerable to heat exposure due to demographic characteristics and their conditions of confinement. Evaluating heat exposure in prisons, and the characteristics of exposed populations and prisons, can elucidate prison-level risk to heat exposure. We leveraged a high-resolution air temperature data set to evaluate short and long-term patterns of heat metrics for 1,614 prisons in the United States from 1990 to 2023. We found that the most heat-exposed facilities and states were mostly in the Southwestern United States, while the prisons with the highest temperature anomalies from the historical record were in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, Texas, and parts of the Midwest. Prisons in the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, and upper Midwest had the highest occurrences of days associated with an increased risk of heat-related mortality. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual-level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non-white and Hispanic populations in the prisons with higher heat exposure. Lastly, we found that heat exposure was higher in prisons with any of nine facility-level characteristics that may modify risk to heat. This study brings together distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, which would each inform unique strategies for heat-interventions. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will have implications for who is included in fights for environmental justice.Heat is a direct and increasing threat to human health. People in prison are especially vulnerable to heat as an increasingly older and disabled population with limited agency over their conditions of confinement, healthcare, or access to resources to decrease heat exposure. We use an air temperature data set to measure short and long-term patterns of various heat metrics for 1,614 prisons in the United States from 1990 to 2023. We find that the patterns of highs and lows greatly differ based on the metric of choice. We also estimated differences in heat exposure at prisons by facility and individual-level characteristics. We found higher proportions of non-white and Hispanic populations in prisons with higher heat exposure. We also found higher temperatures are in prisons that have characteristics that can modify exposure or vulnerability to increase overall risk. Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk can each inform unique strategies for heat-interventions in United States prisons. Community leaders and policymakers should carefully consider which measures they want to apply, and include the voices of directly impacted people, as the differing metrics and perspectives will have implications for which populations and prisons are included in efforts to reduce heat risk.Prisons, incarcerated populations, and staff are exposed to heat and changing climates as measured through a variety of metrics Higher temperatures are found in prison landscapes that have characteristics that can modify exposure or vulnerability, increasing overall risk Distinct measures of exposure, vulnerability, and risk, can each inform unique strategies for heat-interventions in US prisons

Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, this quality study contributes to a growing body of literature exploring the influence of law enforcement in the hospital. Overwhelmingly, participants in this study expressed a contentious dynamic, fueled by arguments, struggles for power, and a feeling of coming from "different worlds." The influence of socially and spatially constructed territories was critical points of contention.

TI  - Climate justice or inequality lock-in? Analysis of US incarceration in a changing climate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The concept of carbon lock-in has been applied to the infrastructure, institutions, and discourses that lock society into carbon technologies, and simultaneously lock out lower-carbon alternatives. However, climate transitions have implications that extend beyond carbon and related environmental considerations. Systems of social inequality are also inextricably linked to and impacted by climate change governance and related actions. This article develops a framework to analyze inequality lock-in and disruption as part of climate transitions in particular sectors or industries. We conceptualize four distinct forms of climate transitions in relation to inequality: decarbonization lock-in, adaptation lock-in, decarbonization disruption, and adaptation disruption. Moreover, the framework conceptualizes the material mechanisms through which inequality is locked-in, or alternatively, disrupted by climate actions. Applying this framework to analyze the case of incarceration in the United States suggests that decarbonization and climate adaptation policies and practices are currently weighted toward further locking-in inequality in carceral systems.

TI  - "Who's breaking the law … not us, them!": Inside immigration detention in Portugal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this paper, we examine immigration detention in Portugal, a system whose daily operations and inherent violence are overlooked in both public and academic discourses. Even within community psychology, discussions on immigration detention have largely remained on the fringes of scholarly debates. Guided by a justice-centered ecological lens, we map the contours of daily life in detention by centering the intersectional struggles of detained cisgender and transgender women. These struggles illuminate the politics of power and resistance at play in these sites, contributing to interrelated ecologies of knowledge and advancing a critical understanding of the systems of power and oppression articulated around borders, citizenship, and the "making of migration." Our findings reveal Portuguese detention centers as uncaring environments where women feel constantly threatened, unsafe and disregarded, with their well-being severely compromised. Ignorance reigns in these sites, wielded as a form of power. Yet, despite this, detained women create counterspaces and cultivate ecologies of knowledge and resistance from the ground up. We conclude by reflecting on how community-engaged scholars and activists can contribute to transformative and liberatory efforts against carceral border systems, working toward futures of freedom, dignity, and justice for all.

TI  - "I've Been Hurt Every Single Day Here, You Know:" A Feminist Abolitionist Analysis of Immigration Detention
T2  - CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While gendered violence against women at home, in intimate relationships, and in the workplace is widely acknowledged, the relationship between border control and gendered violence has only recently been addressed, often narrowly. To address this gap, this article examines the United Kingdom immigration detention system through an abolition feminist lens. Drawing on research conducted inside and outside detention sites, experiential knowledge from lived experience and solidarity work, and secondary sources, we highlight the entangled and mutually constitutive relationships between intimate/interpersonal and institutional/state violence. Inspired by Monica Cosby's Intimate Partner Violence and State Violence Power and Control Wheel, our analysis reveals how immigration detention constitutes a form of racist-gendered state-corporate violence. Importantly, those who travel under the sign women understand this violence as directly linked to the gendered abuses they experienced outside detention. This underscores the inseparability of post-national struggles against carceral border regimes from feminist transformative efforts to eradicate gendered violence.

TI  - Integrated Care Models: HIV and Substance Use
T2  - CURRENT HIV/AIDS REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of ReviewBehaviors and practices associated with substance use contribute to lack of HIV virologic suppression and onward transmission. In the USA, many recent HIV outbreaks have been connected with substance use. Evidence-based strategies for integrating care of those at risk for and living with HIV and who use substances continue to evolve. This review, based on scientific and medical literature through March 2023, provides an overview and evaluation of initiatives for integrated care aimed to serve patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use disorder.Recent FindingsIntegrated care services can improve health outcomes for patients at risk for and with HIV and a substance use disorder; for instance, treatment for an opioid use disorder can help improve HIV viral suppression. Brick-and-mortar facilities can provide successful care integration with appropriate clinic leadership to support multidisciplinary care teams, up-to-date provider training, and sufficient pharmacy stock for substance use treatment. Delivering healthcare services to communities (e.g., mobile healthcare clinics and pharmacies, telehealth) may prove to be an effective way to provide integrated services for those with or at risk of HIV and substance use disorders. Incorporating technology (e.g., mobile phone applications) may facilitate integrated care. Other venues, including harm reduction programs and carceral settings, should be targets for integrated services.SummaryVenues providing healthcare should invest in integrated care and support legislation that increases access to services related to HIV and substance use.

TI  - Correctional staff knowledge, attitudes and behaviors toward incarcerated trans people: A scoping review of an emerging literature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSGENDER HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Trans people are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates relative to cisgender people and are at increased risk of negative experiences while incarcerated, including poor mental health, violence, sexual abuse, dismissal of self-identity, including poor access to healthcare.Aims: This scoping review sought to identify what is known about the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of correctional staff toward incarcerated trans people within the adult and juvenile justice systems.Method: This scoping review was conducted in accordance with the five-stage iterative process developed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), utilizing the PRISMA guidelines and checklist for scoping reviews and included an appraisal of included papers. A range of databases and grey literature was included. Literature was assessed against predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, with included studies written in English, online full text availability, and reported data relevant to the research question.Results: Seven studies were included with four using qualitative methodologies, one quantitative, and two studies employing a mixed methods approach. These studies provided insights into the systemic lack of knowledge and experience of correctional staff working with trans people, including staff reporting trans issues are not a carceral concern, and carceral settings not offering trans-affirming training to their staff. Within a reform-based approach these findings could be interpreted as passive ignorance and oversights stressing the importance of organizational policies and leadership needing to set standards for promoting the health and wellbeing of incarcerated trans persons.Conclusions: From a transformational lens, findings from this study highlight the urgent need to address the underlying structural, systemic, and organizational factors that impact upon the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors staff have and hold in correctional, and other health and community settings to meaningfully and sustainably improve health, wellbeing, and gender-affirming treatment and care for trans communities, including make possible alternative methods of accountability for those who do harms.

TI  - Excess mortality in US prisons during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - U.S. prisons were especially susceptible to COVID-19 infection and death; however, data limitations have precluded a national accounting of prison mortality (including but not limited to COVID-19 mortality) during the pandemic. Our analysis of mortality data collected from public records requests (supplemented with publicly available data) from 48 Departments of Corrections provides the most comprehensive understanding to date of in-custody mortality during 2020. We find that total mortality increased by 77% in 2020 relative to 2019, corresponding to 3.4 times the mortality increase in the general population, and that mortality in prisons increased across all age groups (49 and under, 50 to 64, and 65 and older). COVID-19 was the primary driver for increases in mortality due to natural causes; some states also experienced substantial increases due to unnatural causes. These findings provide critical information about the pandemic's toll on some of the country's most vulnerable individuals while underscoring the need for data transparency and standardized reporting in carceral settings.

TI  - Latency, uncertainty, contagion: Epistemologies of risk-as-reform in crime forecasting software
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - A shift in crime analysis software used by municipal police departments in the US is currently underway from simpler predictive models to criminal 'risk' forecasting that uses data not specific to crime to direct police to areas with 'environmental risk factors' such as bars, transit stops and mental health facilities. Through analyses of interviews with developers, industry professionals and law enforcement as well as published statements, this article offers a detailed examination of how the function and premises of 'data-driven' policing are altered by this turn to epistemologies of risk. I argue that the latent presence of 'disorder' supplements visible aberrations of 'order.' Statistical indeterminacies are called upon to justify a range of police interventions, and a focus on arenas of contagion supplements the spatial logic of containment. These turns reveal that the paradigm of 'risk' participates in the cooptation by technocratic reform of critiques exposing the problematic geographies of policing. I therefore suggest a shift away from critique oriented by revealing spatial bias in purported objectivity and towards interventions in the operationalization of indeterminacy itself and the vision of public life that undergirds and is enacted by this software.

TI  - Hunger strikes and differential consciousness: Impure contestation, hunger, and the building of symbolic futures
T2  - FOOD AND FOODWAYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hunger strikes appear to occupy a liminal position within the literature of power and resistance, constituting a contradictory means of empowerment - weakening the body while politically strengthening the subject. As such, this tactic eludes classification, in fact operating as an impure form of contestation. Scholars have also revealed that food refusal operates as a primarily symbolic form of resistance. I extend these conclusions to understand how hunger strikers use impure and contradictory discourse to frame their food refusal, a tactic understood best through Chela Sandoval's (2003) the notion of differential consciousness. Just as hunger strikes constitute an impure means of resistance, they also appear to prefigure opportunities for dynamic and impure modes of discursive contestation. Through analysis of social media communications, detainee letters, and press releases, I unpack efforts to engage and challenge the dynamic, overlapping, and seemingly contradictory hegemonic discourses of deservingness, rights, and family. I also elucidate how differential consciousness allows incarcerated hunger strikers and their supporters to build legitimate authority within recognizable relations while building space for alternative logics - drawing on hegemonic discourses to construct alternative possibilities. Hunger strikes offer unique insight into how the study of carceral foodways is not only about consuming food, but also about refusing it.

TI  - Constructing a desert labyrinth: The psychological and emotional geographies of deterrence strategy on the US/Mexico border
T2  - EMOTION SPACE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Confinement, hindrance, and time bring anxiety, fear, and stress, often accompanied by confusion and desperation. In the case of undocumented immigrants in the Sonoran Desert, such conditions are manipulated by way of surveillance and policing. These conditions, in combination with physical exertion, augment a physiological stress response that coalesces with existing traumas and fear. We undertake a critical mapping of relations among enforcement infrastructure, migration routes, and measurable features of the physical landscape to demonstrate that a corridor in the region functions as a labyrinth, an outcome of a combination of threats and stressors determined by the spaces migrants find themselves in after crossing the U.S./Mexico border. We argue a biopolitical understanding of current border policies indicates it reduces migrants to bare life rather than using threat, stressors, or trauma as instruments for manipulating behavior. We discuss how this labyrinth works in combination with other mechanisms, including criminalization, detention, abuse, separation, and deportation, to deliver consequences that may deter migration. Despite these efforts, migration routes remain plastic, indicating the continued potential to resist and evade the surveillance technologies and enforcement deployed in the borderlands. We assert that an inevitable result of the desert labyrinth is human mortality.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE STUDIES IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Disabled girls of color have unique intersectional schooling experiences. Yet, disabled girls of color are underrepresented in educational research, and often unheard. Grounded in Disability Critical Race Theory and sociocultural learning theory, this study expands current understandings of how academic and social opportunities are afforded or constrained in schools for disabled girls of color from their perspectives. Through their narratives, photographs, and maps, disabled girls of color in middle and high school described how social and spatial practices interacted with texts and technologies and in doing so, positively and negatively impacted their literacy opportunities at school. This study adds to the current literature with an intentional focus on the gifts, strengths, and solutions of disabled girls of color. Implications for future research (e.g. conducting student-led photovoice research with disabled girls of color) and generative teacher practices (e.g. using photovoice to learn about student experiences and make pedagogical changes) are discussed.

T2  - CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This Note challenges the increasingly normalized characterization of ankle monitors as a positive alternative to detention. Although ankle monitors have been subject to some public criticism, advocates on both sides of the aisle have increasingly pointed to ankle monitors as a more humane, cost-effective alternative to detention. In comparison to immigration detention or refoulement, ankle monitors are clearly the lesser evil. Yet this Note argues that the disadvantages of ankle monitors cannot be so easily dismissed. By disentangling the circumstances in which ankle monitors are used, this Note documents the harms that follow these devices across contexts. The Note then argues that meaningful alternatives to detention should not include ankle monitoring. The Note concludes by exploring both legal avenues to resist ankle monitoring and alternatives to detention that do not include ankle monitoring at all.

TI  - Decarceration and justice disinvestment: Evidence from New York State
T2  - PUNISHMENT & SOCIETY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - After 30 years of relentless expansion, the United States' prison system faces the prospect of considerable contraction. This was certainly not expected and continues to be refuted by policy makers, activists, and academic theorists alike. Using evidence drawn from New York State, this essay argues that decarceration is taking place and may be expected to continue. Preliminary findings indicate, however, that the outcome is not likely to be the most commonly speculated ones: a return to a rehabilitative model, liberal reform along the lines of justice reinvestment, or the straightforward replacement of mass incarceration with parole and probation. Evidence to date suggests that a new and harsher criminal justice regime marked by justice disinvestment is being forged, entailing a significant shift from state penal institutions to differentiated, community-based social control, new private and non-profit actors, and new data and hardware technologies. These observations suggest a substantial rethinking of the political economy and theories of mass incarceration and the carceral' or centaur' state.

TI  - Safer tattooing interventions in prisons: a systematic review and call to action
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Worldwide more than ten million people are detained at any given time. Between 5 and 60% of people experiencing incarceration report receipt of a tattoo in prison - mostly clandestine, which is associated with risks of blood-borne infections (BBIs). Although safer tattooing techniques are effective in preventing BBI transmission and available to the general population, there is limited knowledge about the impact of safer tattooing strategies in prisons in terms of health outcomes, changes in knowledge and behaviors, and best practice models for implementation. The objective of this research was to identify and review safer tattooing interventions.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Studies of all design types were included if they were published until 27 June 2018, the population was incarcerated adults, they reported quantitative outcomes, and were published in English, French, or Spanish.Results: Of 55 papers retrieved from the initial search, no peer-reviewed article was identified. One paper from the grey literature described a multi-site pilot project in Canada. Its evaluation suggested that the project was effective in enhancing knowledge of incarcerated people and prison staff on standard precautions, had the potential to reduce harm, provided vocational opportunities, and was feasible although enhancements were needed to improve implementation issues and efficiency.Conclusions: Although access to preventive services, including to safer tattooing interventions, is a human right and recommended by United Nations agencies as part of a comprehensive package of harm reduction interventions in prisons, this review identified only a few promising strategies for safer tattooing interventions in carceral settings. We call upon governments, criminal justice authorities, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions to implement safer tattooing projects that adhere to the following guiding principles: i) integration of methodologically-rigorous implementation research; ii) involvement of key stakeholders (incarcerated people, prison authorities, research partners) in the project design, implementation, and research; iii) integration into a comprehensive package of BBI prevention, treatment, and care, using a stepwise approach that considers local resources and acceptability; and iv) publication and dissemination of findings, and scaling up efforts.

TI  - Technology Enhanced Substance Use and HIV Service Navigation for Sexual and Gender Minority Young Adults Surveilled by the Carceral System
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project Summary/AbstractThere is a strong scientific premise for the study of integrated substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV-prevention interventions for individuals surveilled by the carceral system (CS). SUDs lead to increased rates ofCS involvement as well as increased risk for HIV-acquisition. Estimates of the proportion of the CS-involvedpopulation with a SUD reach 72%, and ~150,000 persons with HIV pass through a detention facility annually.Individuals with a self-reported sexual or gender minority (SGM) identity are overrepresented in the CS, andexperience well established HIV and substance use inequities. Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is aproven effective intervention for HIV-prevention, its maximal impact depends on uptake, and adherence amongthose at high risk. To date, few published studies have examined substance use treatment and HIV-preventionuptake among CS-involved populations, including among SGM adults. Peer-led navigation interventions havedemonstrated efficacy in building trust and reducing barriers to healthcare engagement, and hold strong potentialto address multiple, and complex barriers to treatment and HIV-prevention linkage for SGMYA surveilled by theCS. eHealth approaches to SUD and HIV prevention also hold promise because they improve access to effectiveintervention services, particularly for SGM groups and younger people. As a multidisciplinary team with expertisein behavioral health (substance use, mental health, HIV prevention), SGM and CS involved adults, and eHealthenhanced and navigator-led behavioral health interventions, we propose to address notable gaps in the literatureby expanding the aims of our parent award to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an eHealth enhancednavigator-led SUD and HIV-prevention referral and linkage intervention for SGMYA surveilled by the CS. Studyaims are to: 1) Tailor the content and structure of an eHealth technology-supported navigation intervention forsubstance use treatment and HIV-prevention (PrEP) services to the unique needs of SGMYA (18 to 29 years)surveilled by the CS; 2) Refine and test the tailored eHealth enhanced, navigator-led substance use treatmentand HIV prevention (PrEP) intervention for SGMYA surveilled by the CS, for appropriateness, satisfaction, andfidelity. This administrative supplement appropriately expands the scope of the parent award and will directlyinform a future R01 clinical trial study to test the efficacy of the eHealth enhanced navigation intervention forimproving uptake of substance use treatment and HIV prevention services for SGMYA impacted by the CS.

TI  - "Fear-suffused environments" or potential to rehabilitate? Prison architecture, design and technology and the lived experience of carceral spaces
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This research investigates developments in the design of prisons, exploring the propositions that punishment is manifested architecturally, that 'good' prison design need not cost any more than 'bad' design, that architecture, design and technology (ADT) may impact on prisoners' emotional and psychological reactions to incarceration, including their behaviour, their willingness to engage with regimes and their capacity to build positive relations with other prisoners and staff, and that ADT may significantly influence prisoners' prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration into society on release. One 'lifer' notes that many of the crises facing penal systems in the developed world (including overcrowding, violence, mental and physical illness, drug use, high levels of suicide, self-harm etc.) are intrinsically related to the 'fear-suffused environments' created by prison architects (Hassine, 2008: 8). This research critically interrogates this statement.  Against that backdrop, a few new penal experiments in parts of northern and western Europe might be welcomed as 'humane' alternatives to the traditional architecture of incarceration. Equipped with state-of-the-art lighting imitating natural daylight, extensive use of glass, no bars on windows, different colour palettes creating varied atmospheres in each 'zone', displays of artwork, curved lines, rounded walls and uneven horizons, the design features being incorporated into some new prisons might be assumed to mitigate against the harms caused by imprisonment. But can aesthetic considerations make a difference to behaviour? If, as 19th century prison commissioners and designers believed, architecture can be used as a means of inflicting punishment, is it equally true that architecture can deliver rehabilitation? Should the briefs issued to those who design and plan new prisons include a requirement to build into their construction features that normalize carceral space and have potential to ease offenders' reintegration back into society? Or is it simply that 'a prison is a prison', regardless of the enlightened humanism that may underpin its design? Could it even be that these prisons have unintended outcomes and perverse consequences, or represent an extension of power and control orientated towards docile compliance and bring their own distinctive pains of imprisonment? Moreover, if the general public are as punitive in their attitudes to offenders, as is commonly thought, how do communities feel when prisons are built in their midst? How do architects of prisons balance the requirements that prisons should pass the 'public acceptability' test (which may include an expectation that they should 'look' and 'feel' like places of punishment) with the 'NIMBYism' which frequently greets the announcement of a new prison?   This project will empirically investigate these issues and inform future debates about how prisons might be designed differently in order to fulfill the goal of rehabilitation as well as those of security, deterrence, retribution and punishment. Challenging conventional wisdom and taken-for-granted assumptions concerning the purposes and 'effectiveness' of prisons, the proposed project is innovative, significant and timely. No research currently exists on the impact and effects - on prison staff as well as on inmates - of penal architecture, spatial design and the implementation of advanced monitoring, surveillance and communication technologies. The study's intent is to move beyond the traditional, historical focus on penal architecture e.g. the legacy of Bentham's Panopticon and the 19th century 'separate' and 'silent' systems (in which the goals of discipline and reform were built in to the fabric of the carceral environment), and to inform knowledge and debates from a contemporary and future-oriented perspective. In doing this, the proposed project promises to deliver significant advances on previous research and extant knowledge.

TI  - "Fear-suffused environments" or potential to rehabilitate? Prison architecture, design and technology and the lived experience of carceral spaces
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This research investigates developments in the design of prisons, exploring the propositions that punishment is manifested architecturally, that 'good' prison design need not cost any more than 'bad' design, that architecture, design and technology (ADT) may impact on prisoners' emotional and psychological reactions to incarceration, including their behaviour, their willingness to engage with regimes and their capacity to build positive relations with other prisoners and staff, and that ADT may significantly influence prisoners' prospects of rehabilitation and reintegration into society on release. One 'lifer' notes that many of the crises facing penal systems in the developed world (including overcrowding, violence, mental and physical illness, drug use, high levels of suicide, self-harm etc.) are intrinsically related to the 'fear-suffused environments' created by prison architects (Hassine, 2008: 8). This research critically interrogates this statement.  Against that backdrop, a few new penal experiments in parts of northern and western Europe might be welcomed as 'humane' alternatives to the traditional architecture of incarceration. Equipped with state-of-the-art lighting imitating natural daylight, extensive use of glass, no bars on windows, different colour palettes creating varied atmospheres in each 'zone', displays of artwork, curved lines, rounded walls and uneven horizons, the design features being incorporated into some new prisons might be assumed to mitigate against the harms caused by imprisonment. But can aesthetic considerations make a difference to behaviour? If, as 19th century prison commissioners and designers believed, architecture can be used as a means of inflicting punishment, is it equally true that architecture can deliver rehabilitation? Should the briefs issued to those who design and plan new prisons include a requirement to build into their construction features that normalize carceral space and have potential to ease offenders' reintegration back into society? Or is it simply that 'a prison is a prison', regardless of the enlightened humanism that may underpin its design? Could it even be that these prisons have unintended outcomes and perverse consequences, or represent an extension of power and control orientated towards docile compliance and bring their own distinctive pains of imprisonment? Moreover, if the general public are as punitive in their attitudes to offenders, as is commonly thought, how do communities feel when prisons are built in their midst? How do architects of prisons balance the requirements that prisons should pass the 'public acceptability' test (which may include an expectation that they should 'look' and 'feel' like places of punishment) with the 'NIMBYism' which frequently greets the announcement of a new prison?   This project will empirically investigate these issues and inform future debates about how prisons might be designed differently in order to fulfill the goal of rehabilitation as well as those of security, deterrence, retribution and punishment. Challenging conventional wisdom and taken-for-granted assumptions concerning the purposes and 'effectiveness' of prisons, the proposed project is innovative, significant and timely. No research currently exists on the impact and effects - on prison staff as well as on inmates - of penal architecture, spatial design and the implementation of advanced monitoring, surveillance and communication technologies. The study's intent is to move beyond the traditional, historical focus on penal architecture e.g. the legacy of Bentham's Panopticon and the 19th century 'separate' and 'silent' systems (in which the goals of discipline and reform were built in to the fabric of the carceral environment), and to inform knowledge and debates from a contemporary and future-oriented perspective. In doing this, the proposed project promises to deliver significant advances on previous research and extant knowledge.

TI  - Development and pilot testing of a mobile health application to improve HIV prevention and substance use treatment service access among women involved in the carceral system
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Project SummaryWomen involved with the carceral system are more at risk of HIV infection, substance use disorders, andoverdose than their community-based counterparts. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has emerged as apowerful HIV-prevention tool and in combination with Medication for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) couldsignificantly impact HIV and overdose risk. Patient navigation holds strong potential to address multifactorialand complex barriers to PrEP and substance use treatment linkage and uptake for women involved in thecarceral system. In tandem with patient navigation, eHealth has the potential to improve healthcareengagement for this group of women. As a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HIV-preventionimplementation science research, technology enhanced, gender-responsive, and behavioral health focused(substance use, mental health and HIV prevention) interventions, and intervention development for individualsinvolved in the carceral system, we propose to examine the potential impact of using a technology-basedadjunct to an existing navigation program to improve linkage to PrEP and MOUD for women leaving carceralsettings in Philadelphia (PA). Intervention development and study design will be guided by our team’s pilot andon-going research, and the EPIS Implementation Framework. Study aims are to: 1) Assess women involved inthe carceral systems’ perceptions of PrEP and MOUD and potential barriers to initiation and adherence; 2)Develop the PA-Links web-based app and assess usability and acceptability; and 3) Pilot the intervention toassess for promise of efficacy in engaging women involved in the carceral systems in PrEP and MOUD byintegrating PA-Links into existing patient navigation. A survey of women involved in the carceral system andperceptual mapping analyses will be used in Aim 1 to guide proto-type app development and user testing in Aim2. In Aim 3, we will examine the primary outcome of PrEP and MOUD service linkage and secondary outcomessuch as PrEP and MOUD prescription/initiation, PrEP and MOUD adherence/persistence, perceptions andknowledge, and acceptability of the intervention. A Community Advisory Board will inform all aspects of theproposed study. This pilot study will significantly contribute to the field of HIV and substance abuse treatment byexamining the potential impact of using technology based, tailored, gender-responsive interventions in adjunctwith existing navigation in an urban, community-based health center. Study results will provide crucialinformation for a subsequent R01 proposal to rigorously evaluate an urgently needed HIV preventionintervention developed specifically to meet the unique cultural and social needs of high-risk women.

M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - ���DDRIG: Cementing Spaces: The Material That Made Room for New Cultures in the Twentieth-Century United States���Timothy J. LeCain, PI; Kirke D. Elsass, co-PICement���the substance that binds together and solidifies concrete���is indispensable to building modern transportation, energy, and residential structures. Global production of cement contributes around eight percent of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions. Primarily for this reason, chemists and engineers around the world seek replacement materials and new building techniques that might reduce cement use. ���Cementing Spaces,��� a historical study of cement and society, complements and informs the work of those material scientists who are rethinking concrete. The study accounts for cement as both an environmental element and a cultural element in the past. It introduces evidence that conventional cement affected the development of cultures in both subtle and profound ways. In short, cement created new spaces with which people created new cultures. Studying the cultures created with cement in the past provides a framework for industry researchers and public officials to consider and anticipate the many consequences to society that will ensue from their exploration and implementation of alternatives to cement.���Cementing Spaces��� focuses on the relative impermeability of cement. Cement���s potential to create environmental barriers, cultivated for control of water during the nineteenth-century canal era, proved to be an appealing and influential quality in a variety of ubiquitous twentieth-century structures. Case studies of home basements, public sidewalks, and prison cells will employ archived documents to deeply explore the ways cemented environments shaped new cultures of family, mobility, and incarceration. The project hypothesizes that cement, by separating people from water, dirt, or one another, had a role in turning cellars into modern basements, inviting new municipal codes and new footwear styles of urban life, and supporting carceral authorities��� use of solitary confinement as a punitive measure. The findings of ���Cementing Spaces��� will contribute to scholarship that reveals how nonhuman things participate in the development of societies, here with a novel focus on a material technology that despite its ubiquity is not popularly understood.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - Imagining the Border Otherwise: Global engagements with solidarity, relationality and survival
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The proposed project is an original and intellectually urgent project that addresses the question of whether, and in what ways, the border matters beyond its physical infrastructure. It is an intellectual history that excavates the question of borders in the political thought of four foundational thinkers: Gloria Anzaldua, Temsula Ao, Jean Genet and Huey Newton.  Just as the national border proliferates and expands its capacity to enact violence, so does resistance to it. The hardening of borders through ever more draconian immigration regimes, expanded surveillance apparatuses, militarized border patrols, and border guards with broad remits and police powers, has seen a concomitant push back against a political status quo and social imaginary structured around nation-states that are designed to keep some people out as a way protect those within. The people rendered outside the remit of citizenship, without a claim to the state and safe haven are locked up in cages, detained at will, and left to flounder on seas in the name of 'state security' and 'border sanctity'. This we are told is the will of the people, with the 'people' (largely) coded as white, heteronormative, law-abiding citizens. Human rights lawyers, migrant support NGOs, refugee councils, and scholars working on border-crossings and the politics of (im)mobility that enable and shape the movement of people have meticulously documented the harm caused by ossified national borders and the security regimes that underpin them. Whilst this critique is not new, there has been a renewed interest in the safety and well-being of people caught in the crossfires of the battle between often despotic regimes and hostile or unwelcoming states. For those defending these people without access (even if they legally have the 'rights') as well as for the people themselves, the national border signifies a site of blockage, stoppage, and violence. The border restricts entry, looming large in this imaginary as a, if not the, culprit in a long list of crimes against innocent people fleeing persecution, intimidation, or a life without hope. The opening up of national borders then becomes the logical solution to this state of affairs, with some agitating for border abolition as not merely the most radical but also the most utile option.   This project is sympathetic to many of the claims of border sceptics and abolitionists, whilst at the same time striving to open out the conversation about the national border in order to examine its entanglements with other technologies of racial capitalism, not least private property and policing. Looking at borderlands and frontiers as generative spaces that teach us something about the limits of a border imaginary, it invites diverse audiences (academics, practitioners, policy makers) to tarry with the thought of four mid-twentieth century writers, who were already imagining a different way of resisting, rejecting, as well as surviving with the border. The four scholar-activists: Anzaldua, Ao, Genet, and Newton, all offer insights into the multiple ways in which borders - primarily national but not solely - condition existence in a manner that is at once disruptive and creative. Working with and through their thought, Thinking the Border Otherwise tries to carefully navigate the many debates and issues animating border studies as an academic field today, as well as engaging with wider concerns around the nature of security, racial capitalism, private property and the abolition of carceral systems that affect lived realities of people around the world. It does not pretend to offer a quick fix or even a long-term readymade solution to the many ills plaguing our common existence, but rather seeks solace in the promise of a future imagined by those that came before. Rather than mourn the loss of this potential future, the research builds on their expansive visions to argue that that another world is not just possible, it is also necessary.

TI  - Doctoral Dissertation Grant: A History of the American Cement and Concrete Industries
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - This award supports a proposal for a doctoral dissertation research project to develop a history of concrete that includes its global, material, and cultural aspects. The project will examine how American businessmen, scientists, and workers defined good concrete, and how they transmitted the material, the technologies necessary for its manufacture, and the knowledge about labor practices to different building communities around the world. The project supported by this award will track the discovery of cement rock in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, the expansion of the industry to the American South, the formation of the concrete empire in the Global South, and the potential use of concrete for colonizing outer space. The dissertation argues that for cement to be successful, it had to mix with other industries like agriculture, the military, and science to spread invisibly and seemingly naturally. Funding will be used to conduct research at government, private, and university archives. The dissertation argues that for cement to be successful, it had to mix with other industries like agriculture, the military, and science to spread invisibly and seemingly naturally. Funding will be used to conduct research at government, private, and university archives. The results of this research are to be presented at professional conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. They will also serve to illuminate the extent to which materials selected for building efforts have a significant impact on neighboring residents; in doing so, they may serve to empower members of the general public to participate in environmental monitoring, to engage in broader conversations about air quality, and to participate in scientific knowledge production. Such activities are especially important for marginalized communities, which have been historically relegated to living in polluted regions often without knowledge of its looming toxicity.This research project will support a history of technology project that examines the American cement and concrete industries. Unlike coal and other alike industrial substances that have received extensive historical coverage, concrete has been ignored under the assumption that it lacks history and importance. By taking concrete itself as the key problematic, as opposed to its testing or use in design, the results of this project will contribute to the growing literature on the movement of materials across the world and their political and environmental consequences. In addition to introducing concrete to Science and Technology Studies scholarship, it may serve to transform the field by expanding how scholars think about the development of knowledge communities. The project shows that to understand the complexity of knowledge communities, scholars need to look beyond professional hierarchies and think about the physical, bodily, and geographical networks of people and places. By rooting the experiences of scientists, quarrymen, carceral laborers, farmers, and soldiers in the material geographies of concrete manufacture, this project will reveal how cement and concrete industries constructed ideas about skill, knowledge, and who was able to acquire it.This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
